Sims may choose to live in university housing. This places Sims on campus, living with other non-playable roommates also attending university. Housing costs will be paid per term, and Sims are encouraged to bring everything they may need for university in their personal inventory before moving, as they will not be able to alter university housing directly once moved in. Student essentials will still be available to purchase at kiosks on the university campus.
Sims choosing to live off campus will move out of their current house and into another, allowing them to move in with other households or buy a new home. If the Sim intends to purchase a new place, it is prudent to give them enough funds to do so. Note that cancelling during Move Out will place your Sim in the My Households bin.

Consider tampering with a Secret Passageway, there can be deadly consequences… 
There's more than one way to end a rivalry. The &quot;Befriend Rival&quot; and &quot;Sabotage Rival&quot; Work Tones allow you to remedy the problem while on the job. Meeting up after work is also an option, whether you choose to be friendly or try more...creative solutions.

There are many ways for students to succeed in a university course:\n\n• Going to class\n• Completing homework\n• Studying on textbooks, computers, or research archives\n• Practicing the course's related skill\n• Submitting a good final paper or presentation\n• Visiting the professor during office hours\n\nStudents may not need to do all of these, but neglecting a large number will surely result in poor grades. Students who wish to get a sense of how they're doing in a class can check with their professors via phone or computer, though final grades will only be released after the term has ended.

The lot placed was created using the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Move Objects&quot;&lt;/b&gt; cheat. As a result, some objects may be located in positions that are inaccessible by your Sims.\n\nUsing Move Objects disables placement rules in Build Mode - even allowing objects to overlap each other.\n\nTry this cheat for yourself:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press &quot;ctrl + shift + c&quot; to open the cheat console.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type &quot;bb.moveobjects&quot; and press enter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\nTo turn the Move Objects cheat back off, open the cheat console and enter &quot;bb.moveobjects&quot; again.

Bullmastiff
The rent for this apartment includes maid service.
A flirty vibe radiates from the beautiful fireplace in this apartment. The Landlord won't allow this fireplace to be removed or sold.
Maybe it's the insulation or maybe the neighbors are very polite. Either way, it's never noisy here. &#xA;
Full of funky fertile earth energy, twins are born here more often than not. 
The deposit for this apartment is suspiciously low...
Tell a joke...get some laughs...easy peasy.
Wow! That Sim's outfit looks amazing on them! It really brings out their eyes!
Can't forget to finish that homework assignment!
Time to work at a comfortable pace!
Let {1.SimFirstName}'s creativity flow!
Another day, another Simoleon!
One step at a time!
What is love?! IS IT EVEN REAL?
There's a variety of metals to be found! Who knew rocks could get even cooler?
How can there be so many different types of frogs?! {1.SimFirstName} gotta gather them all!
{1.SimFirstName} can't wait to get a new fossil to unravel a new story waiting to be told!
Crystals are so shiny and beautiful! Is that shiny thing on the ground one?!
Maybe it's about time {1.SimFirstName} finds something to collect.
What is that smell? And how long has it been out there?
Can't wait to tell {2.SimFirstName} everything that happened today!
Kids always have the most interesting things to say!
Let's catch up with {2.SimFirstName}!
It is time to mingle!
Who to chat with today?
It is time to set a new fish catching record!
It is time to set a new fish catching record!
That is a big fish in the water there!
That is a big fish in the water there!
It is a beautiful day to go fishing! Hmmm... what bait to use today?
What a beautiful day to go catch some fish!
The best bonding event is between a parent, a toddler, and a TV.
{2.SimFirstName} ready for storytime?!
{2.SimFirstName} looks like {F2.she}{M2.he} wants a good laugh. {1.SimFirstName} has just the story!
{2.SimFirstName}, say &quot;Sul Sul&quot;!
Now stack the blocks just like this!
This is how to show your moves!
{2.SimFirstName}! &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
{2.SimFirstName} wants some snuggle time!
Good for talking points, study guides, fun facts, and more!
Bring it on {2.SimFirstName}! Burn off that energy! Safely!
Who's ready for a bed time story?
Reading time! &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;
First steps to growing up!
Who wants to play?!
It's tea time!
{2.SimFirstName} is reaching out for a hug! Who could resist?!
Someone looks a bit hungry! It's feeding time!
Sippy cups prevent spilled milk, and someone wants their cup!
What could be better than bubbles and a rubber ducky?
Smell that? It might be time for a bath, {2.SimFirstName} is maxed out on stink.
Aww, poor little {2.SimFirstName} is upset!
Let's make sure that {2.SimFirstName} is having a good time.
Oh no. What is that smell?
How is little {2.SimFirstName} doing? Let's check in about how the baby's day went!
Time to pick up the phone and start dialing!
{1.SimFirstName} wants... no, NEEDS this!
Money can't buy happiness. But it can buy this!
{1.SimFirstName} can prepare for family expansion with some shopping!
When was the last time {1.SimFirstName} bought anything? &quot;Treat yo self!&quot;
A Burglar Alarm should help {1.SimFirstName} stop any more uninvited guests from making off with {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} things!
There is no such thing as being too prepared, right? Just a little bit of intel collecting.
Fellow bros, where are you? The bro hug calls!
Let the world feel how {1.SimFirstName} feels inside.
{1.SimFirstName} fell out of love with {2.SimFirstName}. And even though it's hard, {1.SimFirstName} knows the right thing to do is to have an honest discussion so they both can move on.
Sometimes love is not forever and maybe it's time to go back to the single life.
There are simply too many things to choose from! What's the best possession to show off?!
Bouncy time!
It's okay to take time to feel all the emotions! Let it out!
Nothing like a solid prank on a solid friend.
Joke's on {2.SimFirstName}, this is what {M2.he}{F2.she} deserves. For everyone to laugh.
{1.SimFirstName}'s feeling a tad mischievous right now, and it looks like there are quite a few Sims over there!
Look for an event that could be made funnier...in {1.SimFirstName}'s own away.
During an Event, spread joy by trying to Sabotage an Object or Plant, rot foods by Spreading Delicious Sauce, or just being Mean with others.
It might not be the best outlet but {1.SimFirstName} has some aggression that {M1.he}{F1.she} wants to get out. Hopefully {2.SimFirstName} will understand.
What are friends for but to be a test run for truly evil machinations?
Time to give them the harshness what they deserve.
How are Good Sims so nice and good all the time? Time to turn that smile upside down!
Let that kid know what's up!
What are friends for if not to share misery together!
Time to ruin someone's day!
Keep this good mood going!
Who needs a good laugh? {2.SimFirstName} does, and who better to make them laugh than {1.SimFirstName}?!
{2.SimFirstName} is having a rough day. Let's shine some light on {2.SimFirstName}'s day!
Time to spread some of those good vibes to the world!
Kindness goes a long way.
{2.SimFirstName} seems like a friendly Sim and it wouldn't hurt to get to know {M2.him}{F2.her}! Would it?
{1.SimFirstName} thinks it's about time to make it official. {2.SimFirstName} is terrible and sometimes becoming enemies is inevitable.
Sims sometimes just grow apart naturally and sometimes Sims need an extra push.
{1.SimFirstName} is socially drained and would like to have nice, peaceful alone time.
Every Sim around is starting to look suspicious to {1.SimFirstName}. {1.SimFirstName} wants to... no, needs to run a background check on someone.
{1.SimFirstName} wants a break from children. They're just so sticky for no reason!
{1.SimFirstName} is getting butterflies just thinking about {2.SimFirstName}! Maybe it's time to ask {2.SimFirstName} on a date!
{1.SimFirstName} is wondering how {2.SimFirstName}'s day is going.
Take up the bow!
{1.SimFirstName} is riddled with guilt over how {M1.he}{F1.she} treated {2.SimFirstName} and would like to apologize.
{1.SimFirstName} just got a new specimen and can't wait to unravel its secrets!
The truth has to be in one of these books! And {1.SimFirstName} must find it!
{1.SimFirstName} just got back from a shopping spree and can't wait to look at all the new stuff {M1.he}{F1.she} bought!
{1.SimFirstName} is so excited to admire the new art exhibit at the Museum!
{1.SimFirstName} loves art and it has been quite some time since {M1.he}{F1.she} had a chance to really stop and stare at some beautiful art pieces.
{1.SimFirstName} feels that this Style Board is good...but it's missing something, and {M1.he}{F1.she} knows exactly what it needs.
Is there enough time for {1.SimFirstName} to fulfill {M1.his}{F1.her} dreams? Maybe sharing these fears with someone close will help.
Swimming does not come naturally to {1.SimFirstName}, but it is never too late to learn! Time for the tried and true doggie paddle!
{1.SimFirstName} has had enough of these Ghosts ruining {M1.his}{F1.her} life. {1.SimFirstName} has mustered enough courage to go face to face with a Ghost, winner takes all. If {M1.he}{F1.she} can win against a Ghost in a fight, everyone will see that {M1.he}{F1.she} is no longer afraid.
Fire left unchecked will engulf everything in its path! {1.SimFirstName} has seen it happen once before. Will {M1.he}{F1.she} let it happen again? Or will {M1.he}{F1.she} extinguish it in time?!
The truth can set you free! Maybe {1.SimFirstName} does good work. But there are ways to prove it. Asking for a performance review or showing off {M1.his}{F1.her} work will prove that {M1.he}{F1.she} is capable.
Death doesn't have to be scary, right? How do other Sims deal with death? Maybe the elderly or those ghosts that keep popping up have some advice. Or maybe, the Grim Reaper would be in the mood for a flower.
Why did {1.SimFirstName} take this job in the first place? Well, obviously because {M1.he}{F1.she} loves {M1.his}{F1.her} job! Maybe it is time to rally and show everyone that the passion for this work is not gone!
{1.SimFirstName} is sick and tired of letting the possibility of monsters keep {1.SimPronounObjective} from going out at night. Nothing can stop {1.SimPronounObjective} from living {M1.his}{F1.her} best night life.
{1.SimFirstName} might be uncomfortable around crowded places but that doesn't need to stop {M1.him}{F1.her} from being funny! {1.SimFirstName} feels ready to get out there and overcome {M1.his}{F1.her} insecurities around large groups of Sims.
Remember: All {1.SimFirstName} has to do is milk the Cowplant and not go near its mouth. Or accidentally fall in it. {1.SimFirstName} can do it!
Okay, today is the day! It is time to stare back into those judgy eyes and figure out exactly why they feel the need to judge {1.SimFirstName}!
{1.SimFirstName} feels like {M1.he}{F1.she} is ready to sit down and talk with {M1.his}{F1.her} partner. It won't be an easy conversation, but being vulnerable and talking about insecurities never is. {M1.He}{F1.She} knows that it is time to be brave.

Sims need to spend upgrade parts to upgrade items. Upgrade parts can be found in piles of salvage next to repaired items or can be purchased through the computer.

Changing Worlds will open that World’s Map.\n\nIn the upper left corner, you can change between &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Residential&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Destination&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Worlds (if you have any Destination Worlds available). Destination Worlds are Worlds where you can’t live permanently, but you can visit while on Vacation.\n\nMore Worlds, of both the Residential and Destination type, can be unlocked as you get new Expansion and Game Packs.
The World Map shows the currently selected &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but there are more Worlds to choose from! Use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Select&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to view all available Worlds.
Your Sim lives in a world full of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;stories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! As their life changes, so do the lives of those around them. With &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Neighborhood Stories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you can follow the life changes of the other Households in the world, and adjust which Households can experience which Stories.
World Map
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Map&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is where you choose which Household to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;play&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or which Lot to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;edit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;add&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; new Households, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;manage&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; all the Households in the save.

Inventory
You can select multiple things in your Sim's Inventory. Select the Multiselect button to turn it on. You'll know when multiselect is on when the background of the inventory turns green. Now you can select multiple items in the Inventory. Once they are all selected, you can use the buttons on the bottom to either mark every item as Favorite, or Sell every item. Note that you cannot use drag functionality from the Inventory when multiselect is On.
Sims can interact with items in their personal inventories by opening the inventory (click on the panel in the lower right or use the [i] shortcut key) and clicking the item.
You can sort items in your Sims Inventory. You can sort by the name of the objects, the price, or how rare they are, among other things. Use the arrow to the left of the sort interface to sort by ascending or descending.
Sims can put items back into the world by clicking and holding an item to pick it up.\n\nWhile dragging, valid drop locations will be highlighted yellow (such as a refrigerator, or Sims). In addition to being able to place the object directly onto the ground or valid surfaces.
You can filter what you see in the Sim's inventory by using the filter interface. Select the arrow next to the Filter Items interface to display all the filter categories. You can also expand a filter category by selecting the arrow; this provides even more filter options. These sub-filters can be turned on and off for more granularity.
You can mark items in your Sim's Inventory as a Favorite item. Select the item you want to Favorite, and then select Add to Favorites. Favorite Items will be identified with a heart icon in the Inventory, and will filter in their own category.

The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Social&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; app has your Sims social connections covered. Add a Simstagram Story, Chat, Plan Social Events, Invite to Hangout are just some of the options to fill your Sim’s Social Need.
Camera Controls
Sims 4 has two camera styles. The default style allows you to click on open terrain and drag to move the camera.\n\nBoth camera styles behave differently, so experiment with the left, right, and middle mouse buttons to find one that suits your play style.\n\nYou can modify the camera style by pressing the Sims 3 / Sims 4 camera buttons at the top right of the screen, press Ctrl+Shift+Tab, or access the Game Camera settings in Game Options.
The default camera style does not have the option to Pitch (or Tilt) the camera. As you zoom the camera in and out, it moves along a path that allows for an easier experience for viewing your Sims.\n\nYou can modify this setting in the Game Options / Controls &amp; Camera tab.
Taking Screenshots and Video in the Sims 4 has never been easier. Simply click the shutter button found next to the time controls.
Press the camera button (or press C) to take a screenshot of the game. Press the video button (or press V) to start/stop video capture. Click the picture button to view all the screenshots and memories that have been captured.
Calendar
The Calendar can also be used to book future events. These events have one hour reminders before they start.
Access the Calendar by selecting the &quot;Show Calendar&quot; button at the bottom of the Live Mode screen.
The Calendar displays upcoming events such as birthdays, school days, and work schedules.
You can filter items in the Calendar to see specific types of events. Select the heart icon next to an event to tag it for the &quot;Favorites&quot; filter. 
Toddler Skills
Imagination Skill is meant to measure a Toddler’s creativity. Being in the Playful emotion will help to boost Imagination Skill gains, along with things like Playing with Toys or the Dollhouse, or Reading.\n\nUpon age up into a Child, Imagination Skill will result in a boost to the Creativity skill.
Toddlers have 5 skills of their very own. Each skill can be built upon by interacting with other Sims or objects. Advancing in each of the Toddler Skills (except for Potty) provides a boost to future Child skills.\n\nAs your Toddler increases their skills, you might find it becomes less time consuming as you care for their Needs.
There are three levels of Potty Skill for the Toddler to advance through. Building Potty Skill can occur by using the Potty, or Asking for Potty Help from a Caregiver.\n\nAs the Toddler becomes more proficient with their Potty use, they may find they have less accidents, and adults will have less difficulty changing their diaper.
Thinking Skill gauges a Toddler's mental progression. Toddlers can build Thinking Skill by doing things like the Show Flash Cards or Ask Why interactions, or by choosing the Study interactions on Nesting Blocks.\n\nWhen a Toddler ages into a Child, Thinking Skill will boost the Toddlers Mental Skill.
Toddlers can build upon 5 levels of Communication Skill by doing things like Talk or Babble with other Sims or Learn with Flash Cards. As the Toddler advances their Communication Skill, new interactions will become available for the Toddler.\n\nUpon age up, a high Communication Skill will allow the Toddler to get a boost in their Social Skill.
Toddlers begin by stumbling about, but with time they learn to climb stairs, and eventually run. Toddlers can gain Movement Skill by going places, bobbing or dancing to music or even Stacking with Nesting Blocks.\n\nUpon age up into Child, Movement Skill will boost the Toddlers’ Motor Skill.
Toddler Care
Toddlers need others to provide for their Needs. A Toddler Bed, High Chair, and Potty will also greatly help to ensure your Toddler is getting the best care. Make sure to pay attention to your Toddlers’ Needs or you might find the Social Worker will whisk away your little tyke.
For optimal toddler happiness, you should head into Build Mode and browse the Toddler sort. Toddler Beds, High Chairs, Pottys, Tablets… everything a growing toddler needs!\n\nAll of these can be found by clicking on Objects by Room / Kids’ Room sort, and then clicking on the stack of blocks to open up the Toddlers sort.
Time for bed… or maybe it’s just time for the adults to relax. You can let your little ones sleep on the floor, couch, or a chair, but your Toddler will rest better if you click on the Toddler or a Toddler Bed and choose Put to Sleep, or Read to Sleep.
Toddlers have a special relationship with some Sims; their Parents and Caregivers. Sims that fall into one of those two groups will concern themselves with and care for the Needs of the toddler.\n\nYou can also choose to become (or remove) yourself as a Caregiver by selecting the Adopt as Care Dependent interaction in the Toddler Care menu.
Toddlers can use their diaper to fulfill their Bladder need, but maybe you don’t want a little stinker running around. Get a Potty, and Potty Train your Toddler!\n\nClick on the Potty and choose Potty Train. As your Toddler gets better at using the Potty, they will be able to go on their own with confidence!

World Map
The individual Sim Info Panel not only has information about the Sim's personality, but it's also a fast and easy way for you to track them down if they're away from home, even between different worlds. Click the direct play button within the Sim Info Panel to quickly dive in game and play as that Sim. It's so convenient!
If a selected residential lot is occupied, you can learn a little bit about who lives there by clicking on the household info buttons or the individual Sim buttons in the lower left corner of the screen. 
If you choose to visit a lot, the Household Picker will appear to help you choose households or Sims from either your played or unplayed households to bring with. 
In Manage Worlds mode on the Map, you'll find a number of different options that pop up in the lower right corner when you click on any lot. Depending on whether it's residential or a venue, occupied or unoccupied, you'll get options appropriate for that lot. You'll always have the option to either visit or build on any lot. Find additional actions under the more button. 
Get directly to the Map of your active world by clicking the Map button in the upper-right hud in Live mode or use the F5 hotkey.
Wants
There are multiple ways to reset your Sim's Wants. Having your Sim Wake Up for the Day or return from work can give your Sim new Wants. If you really want to see your Sim succeed at completing their Want, you can pin the Wants so they won't get reset.\n\nYou can also go to the Rewards store and spend some of those Satisfaction points you earned to buy the &quot;Want Refresher&quot; potion to reset your Sim's Wants whenever you want!
What are the benefits of completing your Sim's Wants?\n\nMoodlet Buffs are given to the Sim when completing their Wants. Allowing the Sim to do what they want will have them feeling fulfilled and happier with life!\n\nSatisfaction points are granted on completing the Wants of your Sims. This can then be used in the reward store for some awesome rewards.\n\nSome Sims might not appreciate having their Wants ignored for a long time.
Wants are back! Wants are your Sim's way of sharing their desires with you. It will be up to you to decide whether or not your Sim will follow their Wants.\n\nSims can have 3 different Wants at once, though one of them will be more about what the Sim wants at the moment.
Visitors
You can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;invite&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; other Sims over for a visit. Open the Social app in the Cell Phone, or select a Sim in the Relationship Panel, and use the Invite Over to Current Lot option.\n\nYou’ll also find the option to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plan a Social Event&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (for example, a birthday or dinner party) in this app, which is another way to invite Sims.
Other Sims will stop by from time to time for a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;visit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. When you first move in, the neighbors will come over for the Welcome Wagon event—they might even bring a treat!\n\nSims will also move about in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Neighborhood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, outside of your Home lot. Having your Sim introduce themselves to these Sims is a great way to meet new people. 
Venues
To visit a venue, click on your Sim's phone and select Travel, then select the destination!\n\nYou can also hit the [m] key to view the Map, and travel from there. Venues will have a bubble over them to indicate their venue type.
You can also create your own Venues by clicking the Build button in a lot’s option tray.\n\nChange the Venue type within the Lot Info Panel.
Sims can visit the local bar or lounge for a refreshing drink, or perhaps the park for a little outdoor excitement with friends.
Vacations
When going on Vacation, a Sim can choose to Vacation in any Residential World that contains a Vacation Rental venue lot. With certain expansions, they may also visit a Destination World instead. These are worlds that Sims may only vacation in and may not use as a residence.\n\nAfter selecting a world, choose a Vacation Rental lot for the selected Sim(s) to live in throughout the duration of the vacation.
Sims wanting to take a vacation and travel to a new locale may do so by clicking on the “Take a Vacation” interaction in the Travel section of their Phone, or from a computer. Up to eight Sims can go on Vacation together at a time. 
Turn your Sim into a walking art display by adorning their body with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;tattoos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! To get started, select your Sim’s body, select the Body button, and then the Tattoos button.\n\nYour Sim can have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;multiple&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tattoos, but only one on each part of their body. Some tattoos come in different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;colors&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or swatches, which you can see once selected.\n\nIn the swatches menu you can also find a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;slider&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to change the tattoo's Opacity. Some tattoos even have sliders to edit Hue, Saturation, and Brightness!
Skin Tone &amp; Eye Color
To change your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;skin tone&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their body, press the Body button, and then press the Skin Tone button. This button is also available in the Face menu.\n\nThere’s a wide range of Skin Tones divided into four categories; Warm, Neutral, Cool, and Miscellaneous. \n\nOnce you’ve selected a skin tone, you can further adjust it by pulling the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;slider&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can also save a customized skin tone by pressing the Save button.
To change your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eye color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their face, then their eyes. You will find many eye color options at the top of the Eye customization menu.
Hairstyle &amp; Color
You can edit the style and color of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on your Sim’s head by selecting their head, and then their hair (or the Hair button in the menu).
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hair color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is selected at the top of the Hairstyle menu. There are a lot of fun shades to choose from! Some even have dashing strands of gray in them.\n\nKeep in mind that your Sim will have the same hair color for every &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Outfit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; category.
You can have different hairstyles for different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Outfits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Change your Outfit category with the Outfit buttons at the top of the Hairstyle Menu and then select a hairstyle in the menu below to set a style for that Outfit category.
There are a lot of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hairstyles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to choose from! From curly tresses and intricate braids to sharp bangs and mohawks, you’re sure to find a style that suits your Sim.\n\nTo make it easier to find what you’re looking for, you can sort by &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Short, Medium, Long, and Updo) or use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;filters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For example, you can filter by Texture to look for Afro-Textured, Straight, or Wavy styles!
Face Sculpting
The most basic Preset is the full &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Face Preset&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Select your Sim's face and choose the Face option in the menu to access the Faces catalog. These are unique facial archetypes that you can select to make your Sims look appropriate for different ethnicities. \n\nYou cannot achieve the look of one shape by manipulating another, so choose carefully!
When &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sculpting&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a Sim’s face, you have two main tools at your disposal: &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Presets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;clicking and dragging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nBy combining various Presets for the different parts of your Sim’s face, you can quickly create a unique look. Then you can customize it in detail by clicking and dragging to make their face match your imagination!
Then there are Presets for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;each part&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Sim’s face: Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Head Shape, Cheek, Jaw, Chin, and Ears. Simply select that part of your Sim’s face, and the selection of Presets will appear.\n\nSome Presets have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unique characteristics&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that can’t be created by clicking and dragging, such as chin dimples.
You can adjust the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;scale&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;position&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and (in certain cases) even &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rotation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of each part of your Sim’s face! Click and drag on your Sim’s face to experiment.\n\nDepending on where you placed the cursor, you will manipulate a face part in different ways. For example, selecting the inner corner of the eyes allows you to rotate it, while selecting the outer corner resizes the eyes instead.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim to access even more Drag options! For example, nose length can only be edited from the side view.
But wait, there’s more! While editing your Sim’s face, you can select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Detail Edit Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to get access to even more detailed click and drag options. For example, you can adjust the width and thickness of your Sim’s upper and lower lip, independently of one another!
Eyebrows, Facial &amp; Body Hair
To customize the style and color of your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;facial hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their head, and then the Facial Hair button in the menu. You can sort by category (Beards, Goatees, Mustaches) to make your perfect style easier to find.\n\nOnly Sims with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;male&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gender setting (found in the Identity Panel) can have facial hair.
Edit your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eyebrow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; style and color by selecting their head, and then their eyebrows. This will open a menu with different eyebrow styles.
Your Sim has more hair than what’s on the top of their head! You can also customize &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eyebrows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;facial hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;body hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nYou can select a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unique color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for all these hair categories, or check the Match Hair checkbox to match the color of the hair on your Sim’s head.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Body hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; comes in four categories; Arm, Torso, Back, and Leg Hair. You can find them by selecting your Sim’s body, and then the Body button. You can select one option in each category, and can select a unique color for each if you wish.
Body Sculpting
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Muscle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; adjustments apply to the entire Sim. Muscle controls define shape and size, while Fat controls a layer of 'soft' bulk.\n\n\nClick on your Sim's body to access the Muscle and Fat &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sliders&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Click and drag the sliders to adjust them.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;body shape&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be adjusted with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Muscle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sliders, and then further customized by &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;clicking and dragging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nUse these tools to create uniquely shaped Sims!
You can also customize &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;individual body parts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Click a body part and drag to sculpt it.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim to access even more Drag options! For example, belly size can only be modified from a side view.
If you don't want to start from scratch, click on your Sim's body and choose the Body option from the context menu to access the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bodies&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Preset catalog. You can use these as is, or as a starting point for your sculpting.
Face &amp; Body
You can customize your Sim’s physical appearance in a number of ways! \n\nUse powerful &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Presets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to quickly create a unique Sim, or customize every little &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;detail&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to bring your imagination to life.
Camera Controls (Create a Sim)
Adding Sims
To create a Sim that &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;looks like&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; one of the existing Sims in the Household, you can select Play with Genetics. This tool makes it easy to create a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Parent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sibling&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of other Sims in the Household.\n\n\nYou can learn more about Genetics in the Lesson &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relatives &amp; Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Households can have up to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;8 Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nA Household must have at least one Sim who is a Teen or older to move into a home.
You can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;add&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; more Sims to your Household by clicking on the Add a Sim button. \n\nChoose &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Add New Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to add a random Sim to your Household. Then you can customize this Sim to your heart’s content!
You can also add a Sim from the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by using the Add Sim from the Gallery button.\n\nOnce you’ve found a Household you want to add, use the Place Household button. You can either Merge this Household with your current Household, or Replace your entire current Household.
If you want some help to shape your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;personality and backstory&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you can Add Sim via a Story. By answering some multiple choice questions, a custom Sim will be made for you. \n\nThe Sim’s Traits and Aspiration will be fixed, and they might get some starting Skills, Career Levels, and extra Starting Funds. You can customize their appearance, name, and gender.
Undo &amp; Redo
Use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Undo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to undo your last action. You can then use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Redo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to redo that action if you changed your mind. \n\nYou can undo and redo in several steps, but once you leave Build Mode, your edit history is wiped and you can’t Undo or Redo your last actions.
Time of Day
Use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Time of Day&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool to cycle between different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;light conditions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nFor example, the Afternoon setting gives great light, while the Night setting allows you to check the effects of any Lighting Objects on the lot.
Sledgehammer &amp; Bulldoze
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sledgehammer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is used to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;delete&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a lot of Objects or features quickly! Select the Sledgehammer and either click things individually, or click and drag to delete many things at once.\n\nWhen clicking and dragging, you will delete all Objects or features in your selected area, depending on where you first clicked. Everything that will be deleted is marked with yellow.\n\nYou can also delete everything at once with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bulldoze&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool. Be careful, you can’t undo after you’ve Bulldozed!
Select
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Select&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool is used to select Objects and various architectural features such as Rooms and Roofs found on your Lot. \n\nOnce selected, they can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;moved&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;deleted&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or (in the case of Rooms and Roofs) &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;resized&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;reshaped&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nWhile using another tool, you can hit the [Esc] key on your keyboard to quickly return to the Select Tool.
Move Lot &amp; House
Do you like your house but not its location on the Lot? Don’t worry, the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Move Lot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Move House&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tools are here to help!\n\nMove House allows you to move or rotate a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;building&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the lot. Select a building with the tool to access the Rotate and Move buttons. You can also press the [Del] key on your keyboard to sell that entire building.
If you want to move or rotate &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;everything&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the Lot, use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Move Lot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool. Use the Rotate and Move buttons and then Confirm your changes.\n\nWhen you move or rotate an entire Lot, it is likely that some Objects and structures will end up outside of the Lot’s edges. These things will appear in yellow and will be sold or placed in the Household Inventory.
Eyedropper
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Eyedropper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool is used to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;copy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; an existing Object or architectural feature, or a Wall, Floor, or Roof Pattern. \n\nClick on the thing you want to copy, and either &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;place&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the new Object or feature, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;apply&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the Pattern to a surface, as you would if you grabbed it from the Catalog.\n\nUsing the Eyedropper on an Object, feature, or Pattern will open its &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the Build Catalog.
Design Tool
Change the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Objects on your lot with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Design Tool&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Clicking on an Object with this tool will bring up a menu of colors, or swatches. Some swatches have unique patterns.\n\nUsing the Design Tool doesn’t cost any Simoleons!
In the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode toolbar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you’ll find all the tools needed to build a perfect home!\n\nWant to move objects and or rooms? &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Select&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool. Copy an existing Object or Pattern? &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Eyedropper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Change the color of an Object? &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Design Tool&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. View your creation in different light conditions? &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Time of Day&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool.\n\nLearn about all these tools and more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; below!

This section covers how to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;buy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; new Objects from the Build Mode Object catalog; how to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;place&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Objects; Object purchase &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;price&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and more.\n\nTo learn more about which Objects Sims require to live a happy and productive lives, check out the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the Live Mode Category.
Lot Settings
You can change the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lot Settings&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the Venue Info Panel. \n\nChange the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lot Type&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to determine whether the Lot is a Residence or a Venue, and add &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lot Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lot Challenges&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for unique gameplay on that Lot.
Water &amp; Ponds
Landscaping &amp; Water Features
Don’t forget the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;garden&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Lot! Create rolling hills, lush gardens, murky ponds, and refreshing pools with the various &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;landscaping tools&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Sharing &amp; Saving Your Creations
You can view all your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;shared creations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Profile&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by selecting the View Catalog button.\n\nIf you want to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;remove&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a creation from the Gallery, you can use the Remove from Gallery button in the lower left corner. If the creation is also saved in My Library, it will remain there.
Creations that you’ve saved to My Library can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;shared later&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nSimply open the My Library tab, select your creation, and use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Share to the Gallery&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.
This will open a window in which you can enter a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;title&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;description&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of your creation. \n\nOnce you’re done, either Save to My Library or Share to the Gallery (sharing will also save the creation to My Library). \n\nUse hashtags in the description to help other players to find it!
You can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;save&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your creations to your Library for future use, or save and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;share&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the Gallery, so other players can download them!\n\nTo save or share a Household from Create a Sim, select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.\n\nTo save or share a Room or Lot from Build Mode, select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save to My Library&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the toolbar, and then either &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save Lot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save Room&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. A Room must be selected with the Select tool for this option to be available.
Finding Creations
Upon visiting another player’s Profile, you can view their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Catalog&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Shared Content and Favorites. \n\nYou can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Follow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them, and then they show up your Feed on the News tab whenever they add something new!
Once you’ve found a creation you like, you can select it to open a more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;detailed view&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Here you’ll find more pictures and a description.\n\nIf you like what you see, you can check out more made by the same creator. Click their name to go to their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Profile&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can also use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hashtags&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the description to find other creations with similar themes. 
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;find creations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; made by other Simmers, go to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery tab&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Gallery. Let yourself be inspired by their creativity, and find content to add to your own game!
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Search&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; bar, found at the top of the screen, allows you to find creations by Item Name, Hashtag, or EA Account ID. \n\nYou can also use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Trending Hashtags&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, found just below the Search, to see what’s trending among your fellow Simmers!
You can use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; located on the left side of the screen to refine the content that is being displayed. \n\nFilters such as Popular Now and Most Popular display the creations with the most downloads. You can also narrow your results to just show Households, Lots, or Rooms.
Downloading Creations
There are two ways to download a creation to your game.\n\nIf you want to use the creation immediately, select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Place&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button in the lower right corner. If you’re downloading a Household, this will add its Sims to your current Household. If you’re downloading a Lot or a Room, these will be placed on your current Lot.\n\nYou can also add a creation to your Library by selecting the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save to My Library&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button in the lower left corner. This allows you to access the creation from the My Library tab at a later time.
Once you’ve found a creation you really like, you probably want to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;download&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it to your own game! \n\nFirst, it might be a good idea to check which &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Packs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the creation is using. You can download it even if you don’t own all those Packs, but any item from that Pack will be removed or replaced when you place it in your game.\n\nWhen searching for creations, you can use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to only find creations made with Packs that you own.
You can also add creations to your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Favorites&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Your Favorites can be accessed in the Catalog on your Profile page.
Gallery Overview
Go to your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Profile&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to share a Bio for yourself, view Following and Followers, and Showcase your creations. \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;View Catalog&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is where you can go to see all of the creations you have shared or favorited from others.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;My Library&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is where you’ll find all creations you’ve made yourself and saved, as well as those you’ve downloaded from other players.
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an amazing place where you can discover thousands of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Households&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lots&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rooms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; shared by other &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;players&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nPost &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;comments&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;updates&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from creators you are following, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;share&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your own creations for others to discover!\n\nLook for the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the top right corner of any Game Mode, or on the Main Menu, to get started. \n\nSome parts of the Gallery require an &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;online connection&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to access.
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery tab&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is where you can find all of the creations made by other Simmers! Use them as a source of inspiration or download them to your own game.
Filters
It can be pretty hard to find exactly what you’re looking for in Build Mode’s huge catalogs. But don’t worry, the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Search&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filter&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; functionalities got your back!
Camera Controls
Stairs, Ladders &amp; Railings
Rooms &amp; Walls
You can also create an &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Empty Room&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by selecting one of the presets from the catalog and placing it on your Lot. \nThis is the only way to create a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rounded Room&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
When manipulating Rooms and Walls, you may notice &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;yellow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; highlights.\n\nGreen indicates the wall has passed through architecture that will be modified in some way.\nYellow indicates an object that will be moved to the Household Inventory, or sold.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rooms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are the most basic components of a building. A Room is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;space&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; usually &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;enclosed by Walls&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but it could also be enclosed by Fences (like a porch or balcony) or nothing at all.\n\nYou can find all the tools to create Rooms and Walls in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Walls and Empty Rooms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; catalog.
There are many ways to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;create&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a new Room.\nClick and drag with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wall Tool&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to place a Wall. Walls can be placed along the grid, or diagonally. Once you have enclosed a space in Walls, it becomes a Room. \n\nTo create a rectangular Room in one click and drag motion, hold down [Shift] on the keyboard while using the Wall Tool, or use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Room Tool&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nThe total &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;cost&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Room is displayed above the cursor.
You can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;resize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; an existing Room by selecting it with the Select tool and clicking the Buttons that appear. You can also rotate a Room by moving it and using the [&amp;lt;] and [&amp;gt;] keys on the keyboard.\n\nThis will also display the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wall Height&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; options. All Walls on the same Floor will have the same Wall Height. Certain structures such as Windows and Friezes may have a minimum Wall Height. They will be removed if the Wall Height is shortened to below that minimum.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Delete a Room&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the Sledgehammer tool, or selecting it with the Select tool and pressing the [Del] key on the keyboard.\n\nYou can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;delete an individual wall&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by clicking and dragging with the Wall Tool while holding down the [Ctrl] key.
Friezes &amp; Exterior Trims
Building
In this section you’ll learn how to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;build&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a house, or any other structure you could imagine. \n\nFrom the basics of creating Rooms and linking them together with Doors and Stairs; to the finer details such as adding Fences, Friezes, and Spandrels; you’ll find it all in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; below.
World Map
The first time you encounter the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Select&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; screen and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Map&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you’ll be moving your first Sims into their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;new home&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Oasis Springs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are great worlds with empty houses longing for Sims of their own.\n\nWhen moving, the Lots you can afford are &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;outlined in green&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. We suggest you pick a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;prebuilt house&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; instead of an empty lot for your first home. Hover the cursor over the lots to see the selling price and amount of bedrooms and bathrooms.
In addition to moving Sims into new homes, the World Map view is also used for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;traveling&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;adding&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; more Households to the world, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;editing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; existing Households and Lots, and more.\n\nLearn more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Travel Lesson&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Map Category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
In The Sims 4, there are several &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Worlds&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to inhabit and explore. They each have their own charm and advantages.\n\nWorlds are made up of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Neighborhoods&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and in Neighborhoods you find &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lots&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Lots can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Residential Lots&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; where Sims live, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;public Venues&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to visit.

Select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Play Scenario&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to browse the catalog, pick a Scenario, and select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Play Now&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to get started!

Travel
Select your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Cell Phone&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Travel app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Travel…&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; option. This opens the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Map&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
There is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;big world&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; waiting for your Sim outside of their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;home Lot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nYou can explore the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Neighborhood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim lives in—who knows what adventure awaits just down the road—or use your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Cell Phone&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to travel somewhere else.
On the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Map&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to visit and then &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Confirm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to start your journey. You might want to visit another Sim’s home, or a public Venue such as the Gym or Bar.\n\nYou can also open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;World Select&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; screen to visit another World!
Skills
Sims can develop a multitude of different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Why not try out Gardening, Mischief, Photography, Violin, Programming, or Fitness, just to mention a few!
Skills give your Sim all sorts of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;benefits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For example, Cooking produces tasty meals that will make them happy, Charisma gives them a boost to relationships, and Painting a masterpiece can earn some big Simoleons!\n\nSkills are also essential to getting to the higher levels of a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Once your Sim has joined a Career, you can see any &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill requirements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. 
Practice makes perfect! Interact with special &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or other Sims to raise &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill levels&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If your Sim is Happy, or is in the Skill’s associated Emotion, they will raise it faster.\n\nWhen they’re building a Skill, the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; over your Sim’s head shows you their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;progress&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; towards the next Skill level. You can also keep track of your Sim’s Skills in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nFor more information about specific Skills, check out the Lessons in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; section of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Relationships
Spending time with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;friends&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;loved ones&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is essential to (most) Sim’s happiness. As your Sim builds stronger bonds with those around them, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;new social interactions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;possibilities&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are unlocked.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Interact&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with other Sims to build &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with them. Select the other Sim and pick &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Social Interactions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the appropriate category (select More Choices in the menu to see the categories).\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;outcome&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Social Interactions largely depends on your Sim's &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The Happy and Confident Emotions are great for making friends, while Flirty can improve your romantic advances.
Open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationship panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to check on your Sim’s Relationships. Under each face in the Relationship panel, there’s a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; displaying your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationship score&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with that Sim. \n\nIf you attempt to romance a Sim, a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;second bar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will eventually appear. Your Romance and Friendship score can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;different&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; for example, Sims can be enemies and lovers at the same time! 
Needs
Your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;mental Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fun&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Social&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nInteracting with other &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and using entertainment &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; such as a TV, book case, computer, or instrument are great ways to improve these Needs.
Your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;physical Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bladder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hunger&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Energy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hygiene&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nOwning and using a toilet, a kitchen with a fridge and stove, a bed, and a shower or bath tub will help you take care of your Sim’s physical Needs.
If you want to care for your Sim’s well being (or &lt;i&gt;experiment&lt;/i&gt; with it), look no further! \n\nManaging your Sim’s basic &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; allows them to live happy, fruitful lives; however, if they get low, they will experience &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;negative Emotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and might even &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;die&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nYou can see the current state of your Sim’s Needs in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If you click on a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Need icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, your active Sim will try to do something to improve that Need!
Money &amp; Work
One of the best ways to make money is joining a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Join a Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;pick one from the list&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to get one step closer to your first paycheck.\n\nYour Sim will now go to work and earn money! You can see their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;schedule&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
The key to earning big Simoleons is getting &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;promoted&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Your Sim will get promoted when they fulfill their Promotion &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Requirements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and max out the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Performance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; bar. Check out the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to see your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;progress&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nUsually, Promotion Requirements are reaching certain &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill levels&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. To increase your Performance, your Sim should go to work with a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;positive Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and complete their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Daily Task&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; before going to work.\n\nYou can read more about Skills and Emotions in other &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
They say &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can’t buy happiness, but it sure helps to keep your Sims content! For example, you can use money to upgrade your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;house&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in it, and pay your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to keep the power and water on.\n\nFun fact: the Sim currency is called &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!

Understanding the price of being a public figure, {0.SimFirstName} stops to take time for the fan, enduring frazzled contact and exhausting barrage of compliments with enduring charm. Sometimes a close encounter with crazy helps to appreciate accomplishment.
True artists like {0.SimFirstName} can’t be bought. Sticking to {M0.his}{F0.her} principles {M0.he}{F0.she} tells the brand to shove it! And while losing out on some side hustle, maintaining one’s integrity is priceless.
Sure, it’s nice to have convictions, but they don’t pay the bills, {0.SimFirstName} does. And the bonus cash from endorsements sure helps cover the loss of any inspiration, work performance, or moral high-ground.
With quick, creative thinking {0.SimFirstName} starts to experiment with the strange assortment of merchandise. The final product is a bit messy, but its uniqueness gains {M0.him}{F0.her} some work cred and a bonus payout from one of the showcased brands.
{0.SimFirstName} seamlessly pivots mid-stream, turning the unboxing challenge into a detailed product review which reflects well on {M0.his}{F0.her} professionalism, but at the cost of some potential fun and the chance to get inspired.
Challenging convention and having some creative fun {0.SimFirstName} gambled on an edgy twist to casual attire. The bold move got all the wrong attention by landing it on the “worst dressed” list, a dubious honor that won’t soon be forgotten at work or by future clientele.
Challenging convention and having some creative fun {0.SimFirstName} gambled on an edgy twist to casual attire for {M0.his}{F0.her} client. That risk paid-off and the name {0.SimName} became the buzz of the event.
They say you can’t go wrong with the classics. {0.SimFirstName} found out the hard way  that “They” were wrong, and the safely formal look fell flat at the event when people failed to notice {M0.his}{F0.her} (former) client in the crowd.
The classics are classic for a reason. {0.SimFirstName} opts for a more conventional formality, dressing {M0.his}{F0.her} client in a tasteful but elegant outfit that hits all the right notes at the event. Job well done and well-compensated.
{0.SimFirstName} chose to live-stream a quick outfit overhaul for the fashion or time impaired. The fun but exhausting event was a success in {M0.his}{F0.her} opinion, and a source of new potential inspiration, if not a possible career boost.
Opting to create a guide for quick no-look cosmetic application, {0.SimFirstName} had a blast making-up {M0.his}{F0.her} face on a live stream. And even though a thorough cleansing is in order, the career exposure was worth it.
After the sixth last-minute outfit change request {0.SimFirstName} stands up to the bride and her excessive demands. The heated exchange ended well thanks to some well-spoken words, but not before {0.SimFirstName} lost {M0.his}{F0.her} creativity and some professional credibility.
For just one day, {0.SimFirstName} grins and bears the terror of bride-zilla for the sake of the work and this special life moment. Non-stop exertion leaves {M0.him}{F0.her} physically drained, but fulfilled both occupationally and financially with a unexpected tip from the grateful client.
Try as {M0.he}{F0.she} might, {0.SimFirstName} couldn’t overcome the obvious criticisms of the latest fad. Attempting to fake it was an epic fail that cost fun, inspiration, and positive self of sense.
While not initially a fan, {0.SimFirstName} kept an open-mind and eventually jumped on the trend band-wagon. That positive pivot gained {M0.him}{F0.her} career cred and, more importantly, some surprise creative motivation.
notification_ChanceCard_StyleInfluencer_04_1B
Unable to fake being a fan, {0.SimFirstName} goes full on critic-mode to empirically assess the trend. Regardless of the impact of that approach at work, {M0.he}{F0.she} is content to back up {M0.his}{F0.her} evidence-based beliefs.
Rubbing elbows and making connections for the whole event has left {0.SimFirstName} socially-satisfied with some insights into the latest industry buzz. However that left no time to eat, use the facilities, or watch the show to report back on the fashion.
Ignoring the social scene, {0.SimFirstName} only had eyes for the looks on display and as result left a bit hungry, slightly lonely, but impressed with the latest fads and more than prepared to take {M0.his}{F).her} work to the next level.
{0.SimFirstName} refused to compromise {M0.his}{F0.her} journalistic integrity by selling fiction and submitted the story, on time, as (skillfully) written. Sadly, that did not save {0.SimPronounObjective} from a long conversation with the boss about good news practices.
Missing a deadline: out of the question! Compromising journalistic integrity: not an option. So {0.SimFirstName} submitted the fact-less story as (skillfully) written; which was enough to gain some recognition at work and a warm dose of righteousness.
Unable to find valid sources in time, {0.SimFirstName} used all {M0.his}{F0.her} literary talents to side-step the facts which was a good exercise in creative writing, but at the slight cost of professional credibility and ethical standing.
{0.SimFirstName} went the safe route and drafted a pleasing piece of click-bait that improves her work performance from increased reader traffic, but leaves {0.SimPronounObjective} feeling a bit ashamed that {M0.his}{F0.her} convictions are cheaper than an outlet fire sale. 
Making the most of this rare opportunity, {0.SimFirstName} holds nothing back and spends hours crafting a blistering report that ruffles some feather-boas at work but leaves {M0.him}{F0.her} feeling empowered.
Why fix something that isn’t broken? {0.SimFirstName} decides to keep the current process. Sales targets meet expectations and nothing unexpected occurs.
Under {0.SimFirstName}’s leadership, the new sales process catches on quickly. Employees and shareholders alike are pleased with the unexpected upswing in profits.
Productivity has gone down as people seem confused by the new process, and the focus has shifted to try to sort things out instead of doing actual work! Sometimes the risk of trying something new does not pay off.
{0.SimFirstName} has to deliver the news that the company is closing an entire branch. Many people will lose their jobs because of this, but it means that the company will have enough money to continue operating and to pay bonuses to those who would remain.
{0.SimFirstName} sends an email to all employees explaining that bonuses will not be given this year. Within minutes, people start calling and emailing expressing their anger and sadness. {0.SimFirstName} will be dealing with the fallout from this for quite a while.
{0.SimFirstName} threatens to expose the embezzlement scheme unless {M0.he}{F0.she} is paid a hefty sum. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} just needs to figure out what to do with the extra cash.
After hearing {0.SimFirstName}’s threat, the manager laughs and informs {0.SimPronounObjective} that he records all conversations in his office. If the scheme is exposed, he’ll make sure everyone knows that {0.SimFirstName} wanted to be involved. The only thing {0.SimFirstName} accomplished was making enemies with {M0.his}{F0.her} manager.
{0.SimFirstName} sends an email to the accounting department to have them stop the embezzlement. Perhaps there will be a management spot open for {0.SimFirstName} soon.
{0.SimFirstName} avoids eye contact and continues poking at {M0.his}{F0.her} phone until it’s time to leave the elevator. The CEO probably wouldn’t want to talk to an underling anyway, right?
{0.SimFirstName} strikes up a conversation with the CEO, who ends up being quite friendly. It’s nice to know that the company’s leadership is still in touch with their workers.
{0.SimFirstName} launches into a story about a funny picture {M0.he}{F0.she} recently saw online. The CEO gives {0.SimFirstName} a strange look, then busies {M0.herself}{F0.himself} with {M0.her}{F0.his} phone. The rest of the elevator ride passes in awkward silence.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t have time for this nonsense. Important stapling tasks await! The stapler near the mail room will have to do the job.
{0.SimFirstName} knows exactly who did this and what to do about it: tomorrow morning, the jelly prankster’s desk is going to be plastered in llama pictures!
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t know who did this, so the best thing will be to play a prank on EVERYONE! Unfortunately, when the stinkbomb goes off, {0.SimFirstName} is as grossed-out as everybody else.
{0.SimFirstName} plays it safe and orders the standard supplies. {M0.He}{F0.She} has played {M0.his}{F0.her} part well as a cog in the company’s well-oiled machine.
{0.SimFirstName}’s initiative was noticed by the Assistant Manager who sent an email praising {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts to the entire team.
{0.SimFirstName}’s email inbox is flooded with complaints of broken paperclips, jammed staples, and stinky markers. Looks like sometimes you get what you pay for.
{0.SimFirstName} arranges an appointment for a repairman to fix the copier. Unfortunately, they can’t make it out until tomorrow morning, so people will have to make due without the copier for now.
{0.SimFirstName} glances at the copier’s manual, then opens it up and starts tinkering. After unjamming some paper and refilling the toner, the copier is up and running again. {0.SimFirstName} is an office hero for the day!
{0.SimFirstName} glances at the copier’s manual, then opens it up and starts tinkering. After a couple hours of fruitless toil, {0.SimFirstName}’s hands are covered in ink and the copier is no closer to being fixed.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a strong tone with the client, who promptly apologizes and explains their issue. {0.SimFirstName} is able to route the call to the proper department.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a strong tone with the client, but it makes them even more upset, erupting in a high-volume stream of malicious intent. {0.SimFirstName} timidly hangs up and hopes {M0.his}{F0.her} boss doesn’t find out.
{0.SimFirstName} is able to calm the client down and route their call to the proper department.
Despite {0.SimFirstName}’s best efforts, the client refuses to calm down and before {0.SimFirstName} has a chance to transfer their call, they hang up. Some people just want to be angry.
{0.SimFirstName} decides it’s best to just own up to the mistake. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss isn’t happy, but with some hard work, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} be able to get back in good favor.
{0.SimFirstName} uses some accounting trickery to make it look like a different trader was responsible for the loss. It’s not honest, but you have to look out for #1, right?
{0.SimFirstName} is unable to distance {M0.himself}{F0.herself} completely from the failure, so it looks like {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} just have to take the heat for this one.
{0.SimFirstName} declines the invitation. Maybe next time.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech is the highlight of the conference! Soon, it’s being shared on social networks and is even featured on the evening news. All this positive attention points toward a bull market for {0.SimFirstName}.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech doesn’t hit the mark. It’s not a disaster, but is quickly forgotten. {M0.He}{F0.She} would’ve been better off spending {M0.his}{F0.her} time focusing on work.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to pass on this opportunity. Better safe than sorry.
{0.SimFirstName} moves a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio into the aforementioned stock and by the end of the day, the stock’s value has doubled!
{0.SimFirstName} moves a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio into the aforementioned stock and by the end of the day, the stock’s value is half of what it started at. Guess this wasn’t such a hot tip after all.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t want to upset the boss, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to just let it go. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to remember to respond to both names. Awkward.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss apologizes and offers to buy {M0.him}{F0.her} lunch. The confusion is cleared up and {M0.he}{F0.she} gets some face time with the boss!
{0.SimFirstName} corrects {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, but it comes out a little more harsh than intended. The boss looks annoyed, but at least he’ll get {0.SimFirstName}’s name right now.
{0.SimFirstName} declines the invitation. Maybe next time.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech is the highlight of the conference! Soon, it’s being shared on social networks and is even featured on the evening news. All this positive attention will mean good things for business.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech doesn’t hit the mark. It’s not a disaster, but is quickly forgotten. {M0.He}{F0.She} would’ve been better off spending {M0.his}{F0.her} time focusing on work.
The assistant grumbles a lot but {0.SimFirstName} is able to get everything necessary done and more thanks to the assistant's help!
The assistant is very grateful and works extra hard over the next few days.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to keep the ideas to {M0.himself}{F0.herself} for now.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss is impressed with the ideas and compliments {M0.his}{F0.her} initiative. “You’re going places!”
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss does not think highly of the ideas. Maybe they weren’t as great as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought they were.
{0.SimFirstName}’s patience pays off when the investments regain most of their value in after-hours trading. {M0.His}{F0.Her} clients will be quite happy.
{0.SimFirstName} watches as the investments continue to lose value throughout the day. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} going to have to deal with some very unhappy clients.
{0.SimFirstName} executes the sell order and within a couple hours, the investments have lost even more of their value. It’s a good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} sold when {M0.he}{F0.she} did.
{0.SimFirstName} executes the sell order and within a couple hours, the investments have gained back most of their value. Looks like {M0.he}{F0.she} should have waited.
{0.SimFirstName} sets the envelope aside and continues with the rest of the mail. Later in the day, a worried-looking {M0.man}{F0.woman} comes by asking if anything important has come in. {0.SimFirstName} sighs and hands the {M0.man}{F0.woman} the envelope before returning to the Sisyphean task of sorting incoming mail.
 {0.SimFirstName} hits ‘Send’ on an expertly crafted email which goes out to the company’s local mailing list. Within minutes, someone has responded and thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} for making sure the package got to them.
{0.SimFirstName} loads up an email with cute pictures of hamsters and sends it to the company’s worldwide mailing list. Within minutes, a snarky executive responds with a sarcastic meme. For the rest of the day, {0.SimFirstName}’s Co-workers refer to {M0.him}{F0.her} as Hamster-{M0.Boy}{F0.Girl}.
{0.SimFirstName} writes an inspired plan for the company to pivot their business plan in a way that leaves them unaffected by the upcoming legislation.
{0.SimFirstName} can’t seem to find a way to adjust the company’s business plan so that it will be unaffected by the legislation. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to hire an outside firm to help with the transition.
{0.SimFirstName} releases a media blitz which turns the public against the pending legislation and makes sure it would be career suicide for any politician to support it. The legislation has no chance at passing now and business can continue unscathed.
{0.SimFirstName} releases a media blitz against the legislation, but public support is too strong and {0.SimFirstName} only succeeds in making the company look bad.
{0.SimFirstName} decides that {M0.he}{F0.she} has worked too hard to set back {M0.his}{F0.her} career progression for a short-term monetary gain.
{0.SimFirstName} accepts the offer and is given a hefty sum of money. The new company leadership and culture means {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to work extra hard for a promotion now.
{0.SimFirstName} wants {M0.his}{F0.her} performance to be based on the merits of {M0.his}{F0.her} work, not the shortcomings of others. No need to make any extra remarks.
{0.SimFirstName} makes a joke about the inappropriate VP and the CEO laughs. Yeah, that guy won’t be getting a promotion any time soon.
{0.SimFirstName} makes a joke about the inappropriate VP and the CEO frowns and raises an eyebrow at {M0.him}{F0.her}. Hopefully this won’t be remembered next time {0.SimFirstName} is being considered for a promotion.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to keep quiet and spends the entire team meeting pointedly not looking at {M0.his}{F0.her} boss.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} for pointing out the spinach. It would have been embarrassing to address the whole team like that!
{0.SimFirstName} props up a life-sized dummy with audio responses. But, unfortunately, the audio track got off the rails and the dummy began spouting inappropriate heavy metal lyrics at a co-worker and the ruse was uncovered.
{0.SimFirstName} executes a SWAT-like stealth move through the back door of the office with nobody the wiser. Risks are taken to acquire coffee, but still, {0.SimFirstName} pulls it off without any notice.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to sneak into the back, but is caught looking awfully guilty as {M0.he}{F0.she} enters. {0.SimFirstName} is dragged before the boss, who issues a warning and a condescending eye roll.
Musical Works
{0.SimFirstName} has received several noise complaints from co-workers for playing loud music during work hours. {0.SimFirstName} loves music…but needs to not get in trouble. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do? 
Splurge on Headphones
Crank it Up!
No music, no glory! {0.SimFirstName} cranks up the sound and dares {M0.his}{F0.her} co-workers to complain. None do, and in fact, everyone gathers around {0.SimFirstName} and has an impromptu dance party.
{0.SimFirstName} cranks up the music and throws the horns, but a mob of co-workers quickly show up with the boss in tow to discipline {0.SimFirstName} and shut off the music. Doesn't hurt to try!
{0.SimFirstName} invests in some fantastic headphones. Not only do they keep the noise away from co-workers, but {0.SimFirstName} now has a plausible excuse to ignore their boss!
Free Lunch
{0.SimFirstName} loves free lunch, except the office doesn't provide it. Can {M0.he}{F0.she} get away with &quot;borrowing&quot; free lunch that belongs to others?
Borrow Lunch
Stop Stealing Lunch
{0.SimFirstName} stops stealing lunch. Instead, {M0.he}{F0.she} sits next to the person with the best lunch and give sad eyes, leading to instant empathy and a full tummy from a loaned sandwich. 
{0.SimFirstName} stops stealing lunch, but it turns out {M0.he}{F0.she} wasn't the only one stealing lunch. To make matters worse, {0.SimFirstName} is blamed for the theft AND is still hungry!
{0.SimFirstName} tries to &quot;borrow&quot; food from a co-worker, but things quickly go awry when three different co-workers catch {0.SimFirstName} with {M0.his}{F0.her} hand literally in the cookie jar. It's going to be really awkward for {0.SimFirstName} to work with the team now.
Mobile Madness
{0.SimFirstName} is super addicted to mobile phone games. But, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss doesn't like to see people playing during work hours. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Play in the Bathroom
Play in the Closet
{0.SimFirstName} sneaks off to a supply closet to tap all of {M0.his}{F0.her} gardens and collect coins. The closet is perfectly humid, with the stale sweet smell of cleaning supplies. {0.SimFirstName}  spends a pleasant afternoon in its tiny comforts.
{0.SimFirstName} hides in the supply closet to play games. Unfortunately, the janitor also hangs out there. Like, all the time. The situation quickly becomes awkward and {0.SimFirstName} slinks out in disgrace.
{0.SimFirstName} sneaks off to the bathroom stall to play mobile games. {M0.He}{F0.She} enjoys some uninterrupted alone time and a new high score.
{0.SimFirstName} sneaks off to the bathroom stall to play mobile games. Unfortunately, the person next to {M0.him}{F0.her} in the stall has a volcanic experience and it spoils the mobile game for {0.SimFirstName} forever.
Social Media Dilemma
{0.SimFirstName} has a growing social media following that expects constant, hilarious hot takes. But the boss has noticed that it's distracting {0.SimFirstName} from work. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
More Hot Takes
Cool Things Off
{0.SimFirstName} decides to chill on the hot takes. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fans can't get enough and keep pinging {0.SimFirstName} throughout the day which distracts {0.SimPronounObjective} from {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to stop ranting and begins losing followers immediately. Without a social platform upon which to share {M0.his}{F0.her} views, {0.SimFirstName} feels out of place and without focus.
The demands of the denizens of social media are too much and {0.SimFirstName} comes strong with not one, not two, but three hot takes. {0.SimFirstName}'s followers are through the roof and {M0.he}{F0.she} earned a bunch of ad revenue!
{0.SimFirstName} was in the middle of writing a real hot take when the boss sneaks up on {0.SimPronounObjective} and is really upset that {0.SimFirstName} is neglecting {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
To Prank or Not to Prank?
{0.SimFirstName} has the perfect opportunity to prank {M0.his}{F0.her} boss and it's just too tempting. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} pull off the prank?
Prank 'em!
Show Restraint
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't pull the prank, but feels awful for missing such a choice opportunity to pull a fast one on {M0.his}{F0.her} boss. {0.SimFirstName} spends the rest of the work day sulking in despair.
{0.SimFirstName} can't resist the opportunity and slaps {M0.his}{F0.her} boss with a &quot;kick me&quot; sign on the back. The boss, good-natured as always, laughs at the gesture but admonishes {0.SimFirstName} for distracting the office.
{0.SimFirstName} slaps a &quot;kick me&quot; sign on the back of {M0.his}{F0.her} boss and as a result, a co-worker swiftly kicks the boss. The paper trail leads to {0.SimFirstName} and the disciplinary action is swift.
Deadline Missed!
{0.SimFirstName} missed yet another deadline and the boss won't be happy. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Blame Co-Worker
Create a Distraction
{0.SimFirstName} lights a fire in {M0.his}{F0.her} cube-mate's trash can, which sets off the fire alarm and scatters everyone outside. Nobody remembers that {0.SimFirstName} missed the deadline!
{0.SimFirstName} starts to light a fire, but is caught by the co-worker who owns the trash can. Now, {0.SimFirstName} has to explain both the missed deadline and the mild arson!
{0.SimFirstName} points a big foam fingered hand at {M0.his}{F0.her} nearest co-worker, who is caught off guard by the accusation. The boss calls the co-worker into their office, giving {0.SimFirstName} enough time to hastily finish {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
Lunch Break!
{0.SimFirstName} forgot to bring {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch to work today and {M0.he}{F0.she} is hungry. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Raid the Fridge
Go Hungry
{0.SimFirstName} goes hungry, which makes {M0.him}{F0.her} grumpy, lethargic, and {M0.he}{F0.she} ends up spending the afternoon browsing food blogs, which eliminates all productivity for the day.
{0.SimFirstName} flits in and out of the kitchen most of the afternoon stealing bites of food when no one is looking! {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn't get a lot of work done, but at least {M0.he's}{F0.she's} not hungry.
{0.SimFirstName} gets caught elbows deep in the fridge with Bob's pastrami sandwich in {M0.his}{F0.her}mouth and Elsa's french fries tucked under {M0.his}{F0.her}neck. Uh oh. {M0.His}{F0.Her} coworkers are really angry and report {0.SimPronounObjective} to the boss!
Unexpected Break!
The boss isn't watching {0.SimFirstName} and {M0.he}{F0.she} can slack off for a few minutes. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Play Some Online Games
Sneak Away for a Snack
{0.SimFirstName} quickly crammed a few bites into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. The boss came around just as {M0.he}{F0.she} wiped the crumbs off {M0.his}{F0.her} face. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't get caught!
{0.SimFirstName} is starving and starts to raid the communal fridge. {M0.He}{F0.She} finds a tasty looking sandwich and chows down. Just as {M0.he}{F0.she} takes the last bite, the boss wanders into the kitchen. Turns out it was the boss' sandwich. Uh oh, {0.SimFirstName} is in big trouble!

Scapegoat
One of {0.SimFirstName}’s investments has lost a lot of money, and it will reflect poorly on {0.SimPronounObjective} if {M0.his}{F0.her} boss finds out. There’s a good chance that {M0.he}{F0.she} can make it look like someone else was at fault, thus avoiding the fallout. Will {M0.he}{F0.she} do it?

Phew! The festive season seems really busy. Let's try the tradition of relaxing with some sweet drinks and some festive TV, I hear they play traditional movies at this time of year!
In the online research I saw that other Sims like to get together and dance. I think it's time to fill this place with Holiday Cheer and invite some friends over!
You've heard what traditions others have in your local area but there is a whole world out there. I wonder what other traditions exist, use the Internet to see how else Sims celebrate and let's get some music going to really set the festive mood!
Do you know what goes well with traditional foods? Traditional drinks! Let's make some of both to test my theory.
You are off to a great start learning about different traditions and foods. Keep going and chat with Sims about the holidays, try some tasty new foods and then let me know what you discover!
Different cultures all have their own festive traditions, ask other Sims about their Holiday Traditions to learn about them.
This will end the Event Quest, but you will still receive Event Points!

Make Acarajé
Acarajé is a stuffed fritter made out of a dough blend of black eyed peas, salt, pepper, and onions, and is sold as a street food in Bahia, Brazil.\n\nAcarajés were introduced by the Baianas, who are prominent figures of Bahia's history. These women are the descendants of slave women who sold their Acarajés as a means of buying their freedom or that of a family member. Later on, they sold them as a source of income.\n\nThis dish, and the Baianas, are an important symbol of Bahia's African roots and everything surrounding it, are traditions that have been carefully maintained for many generations.\n\nLactose Free

You know what I love? Getting up and walking out of my room and stepping into a puddle of who-knows-what left by who-knows-who that's been sitting there for who-knows-how-long. Oh, gosh, I just love it so, so much.
Dear roommate,\n\nPlease clean me so I know that you care. NO, don't just put me down you MONSTER\n\nLove,\nthe dish you just used
Is someone living here attempting to go for a record in how much toilet paper a single Sim can use? I can think of no other explanation for how quickly we run out.
Scientists say that washing yourself not only keeps you healthier but also can mean other people like you more! Just thought I'd share that fun science fact!!
Please follow THE GOLDEN RULE. I don't come into your room and touch your stuff, do I? No, I don't.
I'm not saying that I'm the best roommate, but at least I'm not {0.SimFirstName}.

{0.SimFirstName} breezes through it, although it doesn’t do much for {M0.his}{F0.her} career.

{0.SimFirstName}’s boss is so impressed she might start asking for help with actual writing.
{0.SimFirstName} has a career to think about. The story is killed, and the people will never learn that they elected a total slimeball.
{0.SimFirstName} retaliates, but now {M0.he}{F0.she} looks even worse. Maybe that wasn’t such a good idea.
{0.SimFirstName} wrote a smart retort, and now the world knows the truth.
It’s an online petition. Fans are irritated at first, and then completely forget it ever happened. Meanwhile, {0.SimFirstName} invents a new character that could be even more popular than the first!

Go On the Show
Writer's Block
{0.SimFirstName} is a little stuck on {M0.his}{F0.her} latest story. {M0.He}{F0.She} noticed that a Co-worker accidentally left a manuscript draft in the office. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} &quot;borrow&quot; some of their ideas or just submit what {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got?
Bad Advice
Oh no… {0.SimFirstName} just got a visit from a former fan- he claims that taking {0.SimFirstName}’s advice didn’t work out for him, and now he wants {0.SimFirstName} to pay. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either try to reason with the man, or just call security and have him tossed out. 
Which Story?
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss needs two stories written-one is a juicy story that means {0.SimFirstName} will have to work all weekend, and one is an easy puff piece that will let {0.SimPronounObjective} enjoy {M0.his}{F0.her} days off. Which story should {M0.he}{F0.she} write?
Too Many Errors
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss is a bit of a diva, but the latest story has some huge errors in it.  Should {0.SimFirstName} work late to make sure everything is fixed and perfect, or just fix the most obvious ones and call it a day?
Fan Petition
Fans have started an online petition to bring back one of {0.SimFirstName}’s most loved characters…even though he’s been dead for six books. {0.SimFirstName} wants to please {M0.his}{F0.her} readers, but the publisher thinks it’s a dumb idea. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Bribery
{0.SimFirstName} did an important interview for a big article, but now the subject is offering {0.SimPronounObjective} a bribe to leave less-than-flattering details out of the final story. {0.SimFirstName} can either take it and water down {M0.his}{F0.her} story or stick to {M0.his}{F0.her} principles?
Historical Dirt
Plagiarism Accusation
A blogger for a competing site is writing post after post about how {0.SimFirstName} stole his idea! In a few more days, this will be a full-blown internet scandal. Should {0.SimFirstName} defend {M0.himself}{F0.herself} in a post, or just lay low until it blows over?
Tell All?
In {M0.his}{F0.her} last investigation, {0.SimFirstName} discovered some pretty seedy details about a certain politician. The politician not-so-subtly hinted that {M0.he}{F0.she} should quash the story-or else. Should {0.SimFirstName} do it, or reveal all the dirty details? 
A New Screenwriter
Hollywood is ready to make the movie of the most recent book in {0.SimFirstName}’s series, but the producer wants to replace {0.SimFirstName} with a different screenwriter. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to convince the studio to let {M0.him}{F0.her} write it, or just revoke the rights entirely?

Take a Guess
One of {0.SimFirstName}’s younger and more inexperienced agents is being sent on a dangerous mission. {0.SimFirstName} wonders if it might be a good idea to tag along {M0.himself}{F0.herself}—just in case. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either go on the mission, or stay at base and let the agent learn on her own. 
Presentation of DOOM!
{0.SimFirstName}'s working two cases right now—one boring case that's a slam-dunk and an intriguing one that's a bit more complicated. {M0.He}{F0.She} only has the resources to follow through with one of them—which should {M0.he}{F0.she} pursue? 
When {0.SimFirstName} is issued a new company laptop, {M0.he}{F0.she} discovers some rather racy pictures on the hard drive...racy pictures of a fellow agent and a woman who's not his wife. {0.SimFirstName} can either turn the photographs over to IT, or hold onto them in case they come in handy later. 
And the award for Superspy of the Millenium goes to...{0.SimFirstName}, of course. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} honored by {M0.his}{F0.her} fellow captains at an elaborate banquet luncheon. In {M0.his}{F0.her} acceptance speech, {M0.he}{F0.she} only has time for one thank you. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} thank {M0.his}{F0.her} trainer, or thank {M0.his}{F0.her} career-long nemesis? 
All Part of the Job
After a reorganization at {M0.his}{F0.her} cover agency, {0.SimFirstName} is assigned a new partner. It's hard to keep secrets from someone {M0.he}{F0.she} works so closely with. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} confide {M0.his}{F0.her} true allegiance to the new guy, or keep {M0.his}{F0.her} secret? 
Split Decision
{0.SimFirstName} has been captured! During an op, some henchmen grabbed {0.SimPronounObjective} and started questioning {0.SimPronounObjective} about {M0.his}{F0.her} loyalties. Honestly, even {0.SimFirstName} can’t remember at this point! When they demand to know who {M0.he}{F0.she} really works for, {0.SimFirstName} can either take a guess, or stay silent and hope for backup. 
The first rule of being a secret agent is “If you see anything, tell everyone.” Today, {0.SimFirstName} notices a weird buzzing in the office. Is it a listening device? An enemy broadcast? {M0.He}{F0.She} can either ignore it, or tell {M0.his}{F0.her} boss about {M0.his}{F0.her} suspicions.
Blown Cover
Right in the middle of a huge case, a partisan budgetary battle freezes the agency! {0.SimFirstName}'s department is not being funded. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either keep working {M0.his}{F0.her} case without getting paid, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can slack off like everyone else—even though {M0.his}{F0.her} target might escape.
Agent Games
Hack It
{0.SimFirstName}'s most meaningful career mentor has been acting a bit strange lately...evasive, distant, and secretive. {0.SimFirstName} worries that he might have been turned by an enemy agency. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} report {M0.his}{F0.her} fears, or try to talk to {M0.his}{F0.her} mentor himself? 
Hidden Cache
A reporter approaches {0.SimFirstName} in the parking lot and asks if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} be willing to be an anonymous source. All {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} have to do would be to leak a few boring-looking documents. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} agree to pass off the data, or refuse? 
BAM! The flashlights hit {0.SimFirstName} right as they were finishing up a recon job. {M0.His}{F0.Her} mission was to collect a sensitive document, which is in {M0.his}{F0.her} hand. Before the guards make their way to {0.SimPronounObjective}, {M0.he}{F0.she} can either eat the document and destroy it or try to preserve it to analyze later. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s time with the Agency has yielded some pretty amazing and unbelievable stories. A publisher approaches {0.SimFirstName} about writing {M0.his}{F0.her} memoirs. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do it for fun and posterity, or maintain {M0.his}{F0.her} code of silence? 
{0.SimFirstName}'s got a big report on a new emerging threat due tomorrow at work, but {M0.he's}{F0.she's} swamped. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either secretly ask for help from another researcher, or work all night to get it done. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do? 
{0.SimFirstName}'s heard every sob story in the book, but the guy {M0.he's}{F0.she's} questioning now has a sick dog, plus he makes oatmeal for his grandma every Thursday night. He promises that he'll never do anything wrong ever, ever again if {0.SimFirstName} just releases him. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} let him go or show no mercy? 
Good Cop, Bad Cop
On {M0.his}{F0.her} latest op, {0.SimFirstName} has recovered a stolen thumb drive. But what to do now? Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take it back to the Agency to maintain cover, or let it slip to the enemy and try to impress {M0.his}{F0.her} new Evil boss? 
Missing Package
The agency realizes there's a mole in the organization. {0.SimFirstName}'s not a suspect—in fact, {M0.he's}{F0.she's} chosen to head up the hunt. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} find a scapegoat to preserve {M0.his}{F0.her} covert status, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} pretend to come up empty-handed?
OMG! It's Lobro!
Say Something
Ignore It
The agent was captured and interrogated, and now everyone’s at risk. It’s all {0.SimFirstName}’s fault. 
Although {0.SimFirstName} saved the agent’s life, {M0.his}{F0.her} superiors are angry because the entire mission was worthless. Now they have nothing, and the enemy is on to them.

{0.SimFirstName} is working on a big Doomsday presentation for the annual Gathering of Supreme Villains, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} stuck on one slide of the deck. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t know whether to anchor the presentation with a simple, straightforward transition, or go for a big reaction with something unexpected. 
As {0.SimFirstName} prepares for {M0.his}{F0.her} undercover mission, {M0.he}{F0.she} learns that {M0.he}{F0.she} can choose {M0.his}{F0.her} own disguise this time, because no one will recognize {0.SimPronounObjective}. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} put together a disguise that’s super-attractive, or super-boring?
Getting to seduce the most attractive informants isn’t the worst part of {0.SimFirstName}’s job. But during one particularly amorous evening, {M0.his}{F0.her} spy phone begins to buzz. To distract {M0.his}{F0.her} target, should {M0.he}{F0.she} counter with some whispered suggestions into {M0.his}{F0.her} target’s ear, or try to slyly turn the phone off? 
{0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} team are performing a standard contraband search. With just two rooms of the house to go, the suspect returns—earlier than expected. {0.SimFirstName} has to make the call to either search the basement or the attic, but they don’t have time for both. 
There’s an important op coming up. {0.SimFirstName} can’t decide which agent to put on the case—the brash young hothead who doesn’t play by the rules, or the quiet bookworm who’s dependable and responsible?
While working an assignment, one of {0.SimFirstName}’s agents has his cover blown. Protocol says to pull the agent from the field immediately, but the agent wants to finish the job. Should {0.SimFirstName} order him to escape, or let him finish? 
The agency organized a day of friendly physical competition, but {0.SimFirstName}’s biggest work rival is using some really dirty tricks. {0.SimFirstName} needs to win, and make it look fair. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} use a few dirty tricks of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, or keep it clean?
While performing a routine background check, {0.SimFirstName} runs into an unexpected firewall. Hmmm…{M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t think the information {M0.he}{F0.she} needed was going to be protected. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either hack through the firewall to dig deeper, or call in a senior agent for help.
While doing some routine skulking, {0.SimFirstName} overhears intel about a hidden cache of stolen Simoleons. A little off-the-books op might be just what {M0.his}{F0.her} bank account needs. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} look for it {M0.himself}{F0.herself} or report it to {M0.his}{F0.her} handlers? 
The normal tactics aren’t working on a particularly tough suspect. {0.SimFirstName} needs to “enhance” this interrogation—should {M0.he}{F0.she} play the Good Cop or Bad Cop? 
At the dead drop site, the package {0.SimFirstName} is supposed to retrieve isn’t there. That’s odd…and concerning. Should {0.SimFirstName} leave the scene like {0.SimFirstName} had been instructed, or lie in wait for a few minutes to see what’s up? 
While browsing the booths at VillainCon, {0.SimFirstName} runs smack into Lobro—Supreme Villain extraordinaire and {0.SimFirstName}’s personal hero. OMG OMG OMG! Once {M0.he}{F0.she} calms down, {M0.he}{F0.she} can either ask for an autograph or just play it cool and walk on by.
It wasn’t easy building a perfect baby’s bottom out of such square boxes, but {0.SimFirstName} pulls it off. The design is the talk of the day…until an excited child pulls the wrong box. Down they come, burying the poor kid and his mom in not-so-cushy diaper boxes, which the manager winds up giving the enraged mother for free.
What’s the point of knowing stuff if you never actually use it? {0.SimFirstName} recommends the less expensive brand, pointing out how there’s really no difference in features. {M0.He}{F0.She} even paraphrases the tagline on the brochure, “The suction doesn’t suck.” The customer is so impressed with {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty, she praises {0.SimPronounObjective} to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss. Nice!
Wow! {0.SimFirstName}’s design is certainly attracting attention. It wasn’t easy creating the perfect curves of a baby’s bottom with such square boxes, but facing the pink sides out was kind of brilliant. The TushyCush display quickly sells out!
{0.SimFirstName} points to the more expensive machine, assuring the customer that there’s really no question. Boom! Another SoilSport sold. Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t work on commission, but {M0.his}{F0.her} manager definitely takes notice of {M0.his}{F0.her} fine upsale skills.
This person couldn’t possibly lie. {0.SimFirstName} smiles graciously and accepts the return without a receipt. Before {M0.he}{F0.she} can ask the grateful woman to fill out their online survey {M0.he}{F0.she} sees {M0.his}{F0.her} manager’s dark look. Happy customers, angry boss... But {0.SimFirstName}’s glad {M0.he}{F0.she} helped {M0.his}{F0.her} customer.
This person probably isn’t lying, but {0.SimFirstName} mutters something about store policy and turns the customer away. {0.SimFirstName}’s manager watches the customer go and grumbles, “Nice try, lady.” He compliments {0.SimFirstName}’s good work. Doesn’t feel good, though.
Well, diapers are all about tidiness, after all, and cubes are nice and sturdy. No one wants some fancy store display toppling over on a kid. {0.SimFirstName} sticks with the cube and the diapers see some pretty decent business.
Accept the Return
Deny the Return
Cubes Are Great
Inspired Design
Store Policy
{0.SimFirstName} is hopeful. The customer stepping up to {M0.his}{F0.her} support desk already looks a little defeated. “I’d like to return this? But I don’t have the receipt?” she mumbles. {0.SimFirstName} starts to point to the “No Receipt, No Return” sign, but it’s so refreshing not to be screamed at. Shouldn’t {M0.he}{F0.she} be nicer to people who are nice?
Store Display
{0.SimFirstName} has been put in charge of the front display! Now {M0.he}{F0.she} can show {M0.his}{F0.her} manager what {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} really made of. Unfortunately, today’s Special Item is TushyCush Diapers. Ugh! Should {0.SimFirstName} just stack them in a neat cube or try a more…inspired design?
Question of Price
A customer asks {0.SimFirstName} for some additional information on two different steam cleaners. {0.SimFirstName} is familiar with both brands—DirtSquirter and SoilSport—and they are pretty identical, except for the price. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} help the customer save money, or plug the pricier brand?

Neglecting gardening chores does not please the farmer. He's scared that he'll lose some of his harvest. Another move like that and {0.SimFirstName} will be kicked out of {M0.his}{F0.her} residency.
Word about the bribe gets out. Even though the positive review was truthful, {0.SimFirstName}'s reputation is tarnished.
{0.SimFirstName} writes a balanced review, critiquing the work's shortcomings but also complimenting some of the artist's better choices. Even the artist appreciates the fair assessment.
Everything is perfectly in proportion. Who needed a model anyway?
That guerilla street artist, working on the side of trains, is the talk of the art world. With sponsorship from {0.SimFirstName}, the artist buys enough paint to tag the police station and every parked car on the street. {0.SimFirstName} is implicated in the redecoration of the city.
{0.SimFirstName} gets an incredible offer for {M0.his}{F0.her} collection! Who cares how the museum displays it! 
With all {M0.his}{F0.her} expertise, {0.SimFirstName} manages to convince art lovers that there's no replacement for the human eye. 
It turns out {0.SimFirstName} makes a better painter than a canvas. The body art winds up looking muddled and splotchy. The magazine cancels the shoot anyway.
The &quot;{0.SimFirstName} Honorary Wing&quot; has skylights, sparkling marble floors and a life-size statue of {0.SimFirstName} at the front doors. Perfect.
Whoa! Why is the room upside down? {0.SimFirstName} doubles down and finishes mopping the ceiling before the end of {M0.his}{F0.her} shift.
The top comment on the article says, &quot;Obviously, {0.SimFirstName}'s scathing review of 'Call Me: The Artist Built With Smartphones' is the most biased piece of journalism ever written. {M0.he}{F0.she} couldn't make it in the pop art world and now {M0.he's}{F0.she's} jealous.
What a power purchase! Maybe the money {0.SimFirstName} saved can go toward framing and hanging the piece.
No one asks {0.SimFirstName} to move, and {M0.he}{F0.she} sells ten pieces before the fair closes. Not bad!
The site owner is so grateful to {0.SimFirstName} for correcting the mistake that she offers {0.SimFirstName} a 20 percent discount on {M0.his}{F0.her} next purchase.
{0.SimFirstName} loves the exhibition anyway, so the review is truthful. And now {M0.his}{F0.her} work will enjoy a little extra attention at a major gallery. 
{0.SimFirstName} suggests a series of classes with visiting artists, and the local community comes out in droves.
{0.SimFirstName} plays it safe and buys more artwork to replace what was sold. {M0.He}{F0.She} even scores some especially valuable finds!
{0.SimFirstName} uses the technique for several pieces in {M0.his}{F0.her} upcoming show, but invites the student to stand up and receive a round of applause on opening night. 
Test Day
{0.SimFirstName} has two different tests today, and one of them is going to be tough. There’s a little time to study beforehand. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} spend all of {M0.his}{F0.her} time studying for the harder test, or use the time to study for both tests equally?
Study Group
{0.SimFirstName} is struggling in a couple of subjects. There’s a study group that meets every day during free period. {0.SimFirstName} can either go and get some tutoring, or blow it off and assume {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} doing well enough to pass. 
Counter Bullying Stratagem
Now that {0.SimFirstName} gets pretty good grades, some bullies have been picking on {M0.him}{F0.her} lately. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} confront them with a witty comeback, or ignore them and hope they’ll pick a different target? 
Bathroom Cash
While taking a quick break, {0.SimFirstName} spies some money just sitting on a sink in the bathroom. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} slide it in {M0.his}{F0.her} locker for safekeeping, or just turn it in to the principal right away?
Aid a Friend
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend hasn’t studied for the big exam today. Since {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} taking it earlier in the day, {0.SimFirstName} could easily remember the questions and slip {M0.his}{F0.her} friend the answers. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do it, or just let the friend figure it out? 
Language Exam
Taking a language exam, {0.SimFirstName} is stumped by one of the questions. What’s the correct pronoun case preceding a gerund? Maybe {0.SimFirstName}'s neighbor knows—should {0.SimFirstName} take a peek at the other student’s test paper, or try to work it out on {M0.his}{F0.her} own? 
Grade Boost
A big unit test is coming up in history class. {0.SimFirstName}'s been doing okay, but a good score would really boost {M0.his}{F0.her} overall grade. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do {M0.his}{F0.her} usual amount of studying, or study as much as {M0.he}{F0.she} can? 
Class Presentation
{0.SimFirstName} has to present in front of the entire class! {M0.He}{F0.She} has some great ideas for how to jazz up {M0.his}{F0.her} presentation, even if they’re not exactly what the teacher asked for. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} go all-out and make {M0.his}{F0.her} presentation shine, or just do what was asked? 
{1.String} School Party
All week at school, kids had been asking their sweethearts to the annual {1.String} School Party. There will be cookies and punch, music, the exchanging of flowers and cards, and of course, awkward chaperones! {0.SimFirstName} had yet to be asked, so {M0.he}{F0.she} had two options…
Decorating for the {1.String} Dance
When the teacher asked for volunteers to help setup for the {1.String} dance, {0.SimFirstName} was quick to raise {M0.his}{F0.her} hand! Not only would {M0.he}{F0.she} get out of class for a few hours, but {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} be given a unique opportunity.
Outdoor Studying
The teacher announces some outdoor study time to get the kids out of the classroom for a while. Should {0.SimFirstName} take {M0.his}{F0.her} studying outside, or just go hang outside with {M0.his}{F0.her} friends until it’s time to go back in?
Extra Credit
{0.SimFirstName}'s teacher approaches {0.SimPronounObjective} in class with an offer: Stay through lunch to do some extra assignments and maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can bump up {M0.his}{F0.her} grade a bit. Should {0.SimFirstName} bother with the extra credit, or just blow it off? 
Group Project
{0.SimFirstName}'s latest classroom assignment is a group project. {M0.His}{F0.Her} groupmates are all pretty smart—should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to contribute as much as they do, or just let them do the work? 
Movie Day
The best day in any class is always movie day! The science teacher decided to show a movie instead of teach—should {0.SimFirstName} pay attention, or just take a nap? 
Rival's Notebook
While leaving the bathroom, {0.SimFirstName} notices that {M0.his}{F0.her} chief academic rival has left {M0.his}{F0.her} notebook sitting on the sink. It’s got notes, homework, and lots of other important information inside…should {0.SimFirstName} return it to its owner, or just toss it in the trash? 
SDT Scores
{0.SimFirstName} just got the results from {M0.his}{F0.her} SDT (Success Determination Test). {M0.His}{F0.Her} scores aren’t quite as high as {M0.he}{F0.she} hoped they would be. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} sign up to re-take the test, or just be happy with what {M0.he}{F0.she} has?
Maintaining Consciousness
Ugh, another boring day in boring class. {0.SimFirstName}'s got to find a way to keep {M0.himself}{F0.herself} awake—should {M0.he}{F0.she} shoot some spitballs at {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, or really try to focus on paying attention?
Cram Night
{0.SimFirstName} has an extremely important test coming up, but school has been so busy lately... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} drink a ton of cola and cram right up to the test, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} find some light activity to do and give {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a little rest?
Make {1.String} Flower Cards
During Art, {0.SimFirstName}’s class was instructed to create flower-themed cards for each other. After gathering glitter, colored pencils, construction paper petals, and fuzzy pipecleaners, {0.SimFirstName} sat down—{M0.his}{F0.her} creative juices flowing. The cards would be shared and opened with the rest of the class during the party later, so this had to be good! Two themes came to mind…
Running the Class
The teacher has to step out for a second to talk to a parent. She asks {0.SimFirstName} to run the class for a little while—should {0.SimFirstName} keep following the lesson plan the teacher laid out, or do something fun and easy with {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates?
Due Date
{0.SimFirstName} suddenly realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t have that big assignment that’s due today! {M0.He}{F0.She} could just go to class and take a huge zero, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could get out of class... by pulling the fire alarm. 
Counselor's Office
{0.SimFirstName} is sent to the guidance counselor’s office to discuss ways to “improve {M0.his}{F0.her} academic experience.” The counselor’s asking all sorts of questions…should {0.SimFirstName} tell the truth, or just make something up that will leave the counselor satisfied?
Standardized Test
Big standardized test today. {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t feel fully prepared... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} actually try to guess the answers correctly, or just see what happens when {M0.he}{F0.she} fills in all C’s on the form? 
Average Out
{0.SimFirstName}’s last math test was not {M0.his}{F0.her} best work. {M0.He}{F0.She} got a so-so grade, which could really bring down {M0.his}{F0.her} average. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} ask to do some extra credit, or just try hard to get a perfect grade next time?
School Project
Students are allowed to choose their own assignment for an upcoming school project. Should {0.SimFirstName} choose an easy assignment and ensure a good grade, or find a more challenging assignment and learn something new?

{0.SimFirstName} jumps off the bench, shouting, “Gross! What WAS that?” But apparently, everyone already knows and they think it’s hilarious that {M0.he}{F0.she} sat in it. {0.SimFirstName} goes to change into {M0.his}{F0.her} gym clothes for the rest of the day. How embarrassing.
{0.SimFirstName} places {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe carefully over the bib and grabs it when no one is looking. The new kid is so relieved and grateful, he gives {0.SimPronounObjective} his teething biscuits as a thank you.
{0.SimFirstName} scribbles a note and passes it back to the kid: “Stop or I’ll tell.” The kid wads up the paper and fires it at {0.SimFirstName}, but it misses and rolls up to the teacher’s feet. Furious, the teacher sends them both out into the hallway.
{0.SimFirstName} glances over {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulder and slides quickly under the bleachers, wedging {M0.his}{F0.her} body into a nice shady spot. {M0.He}{F0.She} watches for Kenny, the kid ahead of {0.SimPronounObjective}. Many restful minutes later, {0.SimFirstName} shimmies out, finishing {M0.his}{F0.her} “last” lap with a groan. Best P.E. ever!
{0.SimFirstName} runs into the hall, shouting, “Fluffy is loose!” Soon the lab is packed with kids on a rescue mission, and the gerbil is recovered in no time. Before {0.SimFirstName} shuffle away, the teacher stops {M0.him}{F0.her} and removes gerbil-handling rights for the rest of the year!
Just as {0.SimFirstName} has feared, the teacher scolds {0.SimPronounObjective} for {M0.his}{F0.her} carelessness and makes {0.SimPronounObjective} come back at recess to take the test again. Angry, {0.SimFirstName} fills in a pretty pattern, not even looking at the questions.
{0.SimFirstName} picks a seat way in the back where the girl won’t go (too far from the board). Of course, now all the cool kids in the back of the room want to copy off of {0.SimFirstName}’s work!
{0.SimFirstName} walks over and taps the girl on the shoulder, then whispers into her ear. The girl rolls her eyes. “I know, Stupid,” she shouts. She and her friends start to laugh while {0.SimFirstName} shuffles away. How come {M0.HE}{F0.SHE}’s the one they’re making fun of?
{0.SimFirstName} makes up something about a one-person game and turns the {M0.boy}{F0.girl} away. Then, when {0.SimFirstName} goes to join the game {M0.his}{F0.her} other friends are playing, they turn {0.SimPronounObjective} away! Hmm...probably a lesson in there somewhere...
{0.SimFirstName} throws {M0.his}{F0.her} plane out on the playground, where the wind lifts it high. It does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing next to the slide! All of {0.SimFirstName}’s friends want {0.SimPronounObjective} to teach them {M0.his}{F0.her} new design.
{0.SimFirstName} was asked to collaborate on the score for an upcoming summer blockbuster, but has missed a few of the sessions. The soundtrack that the director selects doesn’t reflect any of {0.SimFirstName}’s contributions. {M0.He}{F0.She} could say nothing and just enjoy the movie credit, or demand that the director change the score.
{0.SimFirstName} is MCing a celebration at a retirement community when the mic goes out. Silver, blue, and pink-haired heads are shaking and a few people holler, “We can’t hear you.” {0.SimFirstName} can try shouting {M0.his}{F0.her} routine, or give up and cue the piano player.
A local animal shelter has invited {0.SimFirstName} to MC their fundraiser, but {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot to prepare! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} mine the internet for animal jokes, or wing it and hope for the best?
All the critics are talking about a new young prodigy, who is auditioning against {0.SimFirstName} for a performance with a highly esteemed orchestra. The prodigy arrives with a large stain on his shirt, which he doesn’t seem to notice. {0.SimFirstName} has already performed and could tell him. Or not.
{0.SimFirstName} is halfway through {M0.his}{F0.her} opening set when the bassist for the headliner staggers out and starts taking over the show. He’s on his third 8-minute solo and the clock is running out. Does {0.SimFirstName} cut him short, or roll with it to protect the gig?
There’s a joke in {0.SimFirstName}’s routine at the expense of a friend who’s stopping by tonight. Taking it out will make the routine a little thin, but {M0.he}{F0.she} is not sure how {M0.his}{F0.her} friend will take it.
{0.SimFirstName} auditions for a TV ad and gets the part… of a singing vegetable. What’s worse, the lyrics aren’t even funny. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} stick to the script, or try to spice things up?
Who knew a little bubble gum, fishing line, and cotton balls would be such a hit with the guests?
Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} should have passed on the bubble gum, fishing line, and cotton balls. The guests hate the improvised pieces, and so does the client.
The imported juice costs the bar some money--but it's so popular that business is better than ever!
{0.SimFirstName} shells out the cash for the expensive imported juice, but customers don't like the drinks {M0.he}{F0.she} makes with it.
Perfect! A microwave can be a great time-saver.
Nuke It
Remake the Dish
Ask Chef
Serve It
Whoops! The dishwasher malfunctioned. Now {0.SimFirstName} has to wash all the dishes by hand--and clean up a sudsy mess.
Whew! {0.SimFirstName} is lucky. Even overloaded, the dishwasher worked--the dishes are clean now, and {0.SimFirstName} is back on track.
Make Improvised Centerpieces
Go Without
Dish Undercooked!
An unhappy customer has sent back a dish that's undercooked--and inedible. {0.SimFirstName} can handle this one of two ways:  either nuke it in the microwave or make the dish over from scratch.
Cheese Shipment Smells Funny
{0.SimFirstName} knows that fancy cheeses sometimes smell a little...ripe, but this latest shipment really stinks! Should {0.SimFirstName} ask the chef to take a whiff or just go ahead and serve it?
Centerpieces Haven't Arrived!
{0.SimFirstName} is catering a huge party for a prominent client. Everything's going swimmingly until {0.SimFirstName} realizes that the centerpieces haven't arrived! {M0.He}{F0.She} can improvise something or go without and hope no one notices.
Cash Shortage
It's finally the end of {0.SimFirstName}'s shift, but {M0.he}{F0.she} can't go home yet--the cash register's short. {0.SimFirstName} knows this wasn't {M0.his}{F0.her} doing and has to decide to either report {M0.his}{F0.her} Co-worker or keep quiet about it.
Too Many Dishes
Uh oh! Dirty dishes are piling up, and {0.SimFirstName} can't keep up. {0.SimFirstName} can either overload the dishwasher or give up and leave some dishes unwashed.
Raving Fan
{0.SimFirstName}'s newfound fame behind the bar does have its downsides:  as the bar staff prepares for a long night slinging drinks, a raving fan bursts in, causing commotion and demanding an autograph. Will {0.SimFirstName} sign or kick out the out-of-line fan?
Crazy Fan
{0.SimFirstName}'s newfound culinary fame does have its downsides:  as the kitchen staff prepares for service, a raving fan bursts in, causing commotion and demanding an autograph. Will {0.SimFirstName} sign or kick out the out-of-line fan?
Important Critic
{0.SimFirstName} notices the kitchen staff whispering and asks what's going on. As it turns out, an important restaurant critic has just been seated. {0.SimFirstName} can either show off {M0.his}{F0.her} chops by serving Lobster Thermidor, a signature dish, or mac and cheese, the critic's favorite comfort food.
Exotic Juice
{0.SimFirstName} notices that a competitor has begun serving a fancy, imported juice in their drinks. It's expensive, but clearly customers love it. Should {0.SimFirstName} import the exotic juice, too, or keep using local juices in {M0.his}{F0.her} drinks?
Mythical Drink Guide
On an otherwise uninteresting day, an unbelievably old man with an unbelievably long beard walks into {0.SimFirstName}'s bar. Under his arm is a dusty tome which the man says is a mythical drink guide that all the mixologists in town would love to get their hands on. He's selling it for a pile of Simoleons. Should {0.SimFirstName} buy it or not?
Add Extra Juice
One of {0.SimFirstName}'s regulars is asking for a bit more juice in his drink. {0.SimFirstName} wants to give it to him, but knows {M0.he}{F0.she} should say no.
Keep Quiet
Report Co-worker
Even though {0.SimFirstName} is polite when {M0.he}{F0.she} declines to put extra juice in the drink, the customer gets angry and demands to see the manager, who takes his side.
When {0.SimFirstName} politely declines to put extra juice in the customer's drink, the customer demands to see the manager. Luckily, she takes {0.SimFirstName}'s side.
The fan screams, &quot;You're the best!&quot; after getting his autograph and leaves, but it takes the bar a while to recover and get drinks made on time.
Overload the Dishwasher
Leave Dishes Unwashed
After giving a little extra to the regular, everyone else starts asking for more juice, too, which costs the bar money. But everyone loves {0.SimFirstName}!
The fan screams, &quot;You're the best!&quot; after getting his autograph and leaves, but his disturbance causes dinner service to be delayed.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with the cheese--it's SUPPOSED to smell like a case of rotten eggs. Now Chef is angry that {0.SimFirstName} wasted his time. 
Chef sniffs the cheese and confirms that it's supposed to smell like a case of rotten eggs. Alright, then!
Maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have spoken up after all -- when the boss finds out there's money missing from the register, he makes the staff pay it back to him from their tips.
&quot;Oh, yeah? Well, your drinks aren't so great anyway,&quot; yells the fan as {0.SimFirstName} nudges him out the door. &quot;Worst juice in town!&quot;
The bar staff all heave a sigh of relief and thank {0.SimFirstName} for helping them get back to work.

The kitchen staff all heave a sigh of relief and thank {0.SimFirstName} for helping them get back to work.
&quot;Oh, yeah? Well, your food isn't so great anyway,&quot; yells the fan as {0.SimFirstName} nudges him out the door. &quot;I've gotten better Lobster Thermidor from a drive-thru!&quot;
&quot;While I assumed that {0.SimFirstName} would attempt to dazzle me with a complicated recipe, I was surprised to be served mac and cheese. While it was not an adventurous dish, it did remind me of the food my mom used to make.&quot;
Sometimes, it's good to know your limits. {0.SimFirstName} leaving a few dishes unwashed isn't the end of the world.
Guests ask about the missing centerpieces, and {0.SimFirstName} has to issue a refund for them.
{0.SimFirstName} turns down the old man's offer, sensing there's something a little… funny about him. A week later, there's a news report about a charlatan trying to sell a bogus drink guide to mixologists all over town.
&quot;{0.SimFirstName}'s Lobster Thermidor is edible, but reductive. I was expecting excellence and was disappointed with this meal.&quot;
&quot;The distinctive flavors, creamy texture, and glorious presentation of the Lobster Thermidor should be enough to inspire a discerning Sim to visit {0.SimFirstName}'s restaurant.&quot;
Not only is {0.SimFirstName} out of a stack of cash, but the only recipe {F0.she}{M0.he} finds in the guide that looks interesting turns out to be a foul-tasting dud.
It took a stack of cash, but {0.SimFirstName} is excited to find a new recipe in the drink guide that will impress {M0.his}{F0.her} customers and hopefully give the business a jumpstart.

Kick Fan Out
{0.SimFirstName}'s Co-worker, feeling a bit sheepish, apologizes for the mistake and promises to be more careful in the future.
It seems this isn't the first time the register has come up short. After being fired, {0.SimFirstName}'s Co-worker yells at {M0.him}{F0.her}.
Not only does everyone love the cheese, but guests begin asking for seconds. Apparently this stinky cheese is a hit!

This time, the dish is cooked to perfection. The customer is not only happy, but leaves {0.SimFirstName} an extra tip.
Remaking the dish takes too long, and the customer leaves. Maybe next time, {0.SimFirstName} should use the microwave.
{0.SimFirstName} bucks the trend and keeps making drinks with familiar, local juices, and customers keep drinking them. No harm, no foul, no unnecessary expense.

{0.SimFirstName} climbs a nearby tree and coaxes the kitten out of the window. {M0.He}{F0.She} had to drop a box of loot to do it, but {0.SimFirstName}'s no kitten killer! 
A team member arrives, only to trip an alarm on the way in. {0.SimFirstName} escapes but {M0.his}{F0.her} cohort gets pinched on the way out! That won't go over well with the bosses...
Everyone keeps asking if {0.SimFirstName}'s plans are locally sourced, and if all agreements are fair trade. Exhausting. {0.SimFirstName} can't deal with this crowd!
It's good to know second in command has {0.SimFirstName}'s back 100 percent. Well more like 25 percent. Hey, maybe next year, that cut can go up to 30. But let's not get hasty. 
{0.SimFirstName} turns to run, which is when the kitten hurls itself out of the window and lands, claws out, on {0.SimFirstName}'s head. Swearing, {M0.he}{F0.she} rushes off to tend to her wounds while the kitten prances away merrily.
It was a trap. The software company uses the attempts to gather digital &quot;fingerprints&quot; from the world's best hackers and lock them out of the system! What gives them the right??
Everyone loves hamsters with LASER EYES! Pew! Pew! Kaboom! {0.SimFirstName} wonders if this will actually increase traffic to the company's site.
When the documents go out, there is a lot of tension and a few isolated incidents of violence, but thankfully no riot. {0.SimFirstName} hopes it was worth it.
Eh, that kitten knew what it was getting into when it signed up to be an indoor cat. {0.SimFirstName} scampers off with two armfuls of loot to fence.
Ah, the ol' &quot;Crazy Ivan!&quot; {0.SimFirstName} spins the car around, and, catching the cops by surprise, speeds between the two patrol cars with inches to spare on either side. The patrol cars collide attempting to follow {M0.him}{F0.her}. Clean getaway!
How could {0.SimFirstName} not have noticed the camera crew on the other side of the coffee stand? They were shooting a movie. The pickpocketing was caught on film.
Let it slide? What's the point of muscle that no one's scared of?! The bosses are mad that {0.SimFirstName} didn't take the opportunity to prove {M0.his}{F0.her} worth.
Nothing's ever really gone from the internet. {0.SimFirstName} isn't able to remove every instance of the old posts, and only deleting some is as good as doing nothing.
The car sails beautifully over the gap in the bridge. It's just like in that TV show except that when {0.SimFirstName} lands {M0.he}{F0.she} breaks both axles and loses the muffler. Whoops.
{0.SimFirstName} pathetically tries to pass off a garbage bag and trash can lid as the height of nouveau fashion. But hey! {M0.He}{F0.She} draws so much attention as a faux fashion correspondent that no one notices the deal go down.
{0.SimFirstName} has frost-bite from sitting in the freezer! {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to get out when the cook opens the door, but it will be a while before {M0.his}{F0.her} safe-cracking fingers are at full dexterity again.
High-profile targets mean high-profile consequences. Maybe {0.SimFirstName} can find a target that DOESN'T have the full attention of every bystander and camera in the area.
A rare talent like the Chonky Dog only comes around once in several generations. His handler's are quick to pay the ransom in full!
Another team member arrives in time to open the walk-in and help carry out loads of tuna. Things worked out, but maybe this was not a solo job after all.
{0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} crew hang out in front of the juice bar looking mean. The bar's clientele is scared to go in! The juice bar will be forced to close in no time.
 Hey, the rest of the internet didn't earn this private glimpse into the most anticpated book of a generation! The sweet, sweet secrets are all {0.SimFirstName}'s.
{0.SimFirstName} knows that the smartest hackers don't go after jobs that bring that much attention. Better to stick to the shadows (if the internet had shadows).
{0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} crew hang out in front of the juice bar looking mean. The hipsters LOVE the gangster kitsch and the juice bar thrives.
Now second in command wants a higher cut of every robbery. How is {0.SimFirstName} supposed to afford {M0.his}{F0.her} weekly pedicure, teeth whitening and poolside massage? 
While servicing the latest dirty shuttle, {0.SimFirstName} notices something strange…there’s a greenish moss growing on the underside of the wings. If the shuttle really went to planet Myotkee, there’d be a lot of meteorite debris and no moss. Should {0.SimFirstName} ask {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, or not ask questions? 
Strange Transmission
While on a solo mission to space quadrant 89 (how are there so many quadrants?), {0.SimFirstName} hears a strange transmission come across the radio. It doesn’t even sound like Simlish, just a bunch of silly, gibberish language instead. What could it be? {0.SimFirstName} can either follow the trajectory of the transmission, or ignore it.
Crazy Diagnostics
Moments before a big launch, the avionics on the shuttle are acting up-blinking and beeping like crazy. It might be nothing, but it also might be a terrifying fatal error. Should {0.SimFirstName} scrub the entire launch, or let it proceed and hope for the best?
Moon Cheese Hijacking
{0.SimFirstName} is taking a suspect into custody when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets a call that there’s a Moon Cheese hijacking in progress. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} pretty close, but in order to respond to the call {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} have to leave {M0.his}{F0.her} suspect unattended for a while. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Selecting a Mission
{0.SimFirstName}’s offered the chance to choose {M0.his}{F0.her} team’s next mission. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either send {M0.his}{F0.her} astronauts on a high-stakes mission to the outer reaches of space, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can send them on an easy information-gathering run closer to home. Which should {M0.he}{F0.she} choose?
As {0.SimFirstName} walks up to the pilot-side porthole, the pilot ejects from his craft in an escape pod! He’s long gone, but {0.SimFirstName} throws the tarp off the cargo to reveal 13 pygmy Grinxes! {0.SimFirstName} calls Alienlife Control and gets a bonus for being so observant.
Gouge the customers
Charge a fair price
Inside the capsule, {0.SimFirstName} finds a tiny space creature. Wow! A totally undocumented form of life! This is going to look great on {0.SimFirstName}’s desk. 
When {0.SimFirstName} opens the capsule a tiny puff of shimmery dust floats out,  which {M0.he}{F0.she} immediately inhales. That’s probably not good. A few minutes later {0.SimFirstName} feels extremely ill. Thanks a lot, Space Dust!
Leave It Alone

It’s {M0.his}{F0.her} first mission, so it’s smart not to take stupid chances. {0.SimFirstName} gives the object a wide berth.
The guard doesn’t budge. Doesn’t blink, doesn’t smile, and doesn’t move. {0.SimFirstName}’s left staring at the windows, trying to see movement inside. That’s not going to be enough to take any action against the factory.
A few words of flattery, a few bats of the eyelashes, and {0.SimFirstName}’s in. Not only is the plant breaking safety violations and staffed by underpaid migrant laborers, but the only communication device is a fax machine. {0.SimFirstName} shuts down the factory and raids the kitchen for a mid-day snack.
The shuttle hovers for a few seconds before crashing back down to earth. The impact shatters the shuttle frame and fries the electronic equipment. Plus, all the astronauts are claiming they have whiplash now.
{0.SimFirstName} convinces the entire control room that there’s nothing to worry about, and indeed the launch goes off without a hitch. The astronauts are launched safely into orbit, and {0.SimFirstName} tries hard not to think about the eventual landing.

As {M0.he}{F0.she} draws closer to the Unidentified Floating Object, {0.SimFirstName} realizes that it’s a harmless but beautiful moon rock! {M0.He}{F0.She} sends out the robot arm to retrieve it, and {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} keep it forever as a nice memento of {M0.his}{F0.her} first trip.
As {M0.he}{F0.she} draws closer to the Unidentified Floating Object, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that it's a space squid--and it's making some very threatening gestures. {0.SimFirstName} fires the retro rockets before the monster space-inks all over {M0.his}{F0.her} ship.
It’s best to let the men in the black suits deal with things like this. {0.SimFirstName} is praised for not asking too many questions.

It eats up some more of {M0.his}{F0.her} precious fuel, but {0.SimFirstName}’s able to make the repair in a jiffy. The instructor praises {M0.his}{F0.her} quick thinking and risk-taking.
Making the fix eats up even more fuel, and eventually {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} running on fumes. If this were a real shuttle emergency, the craft would never have made it back home.

The pilot must have smelled trouble, because he peels off in a hurry. {0.SimFirstName} jumps in {M0.his}{F0.her} patrol pod and catches him after a short chase through the Zoricon-9 galaxy. The holo-vid of the chase gets millions of hits on the interstellar viralnet!
{0.SimFirstName} takes so long trying to identify the suspect that he takes off. {0.SimFirstName} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} patrol pod to give chase, but the standard issue ranger pods can only make point five past lightspeed. {M0.He}{F0.She} loses the suspect somewhere around the Zoricon-9 galaxy.
High-Stakes Mission
Easy Close Mission
After dozens of attempts, {M0.he}{F0.she} just can’t crack the formula. Now {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} behind deadline and has to ask for help on what should have been an easy task. 
After a few tries, {0.SimFirstName} stumbles on the right formula to automate the entire trajectory-calculating process. {M0.He}{F0.She} completes the task sooner than expected, and shares {M0.his}{F0.her} secret with the rest of the team. 
There’s a whole warehouse full of extra panels, so {0.SimFirstName} grabs some new ones and installs them. The old ones will make a nice new foosball table for the staff’s break room.

Abort! Abort! The rocket was programmed to land on soft cheese, but instead landed on hard rock! This was an understandable miscalculation, but nonetheless the ship is crippled; the landing back home might be a bit tricky...
{0.SimFirstName} is getting nowhere. The alien's explanation is as half-baked as the one before, possibly even quarter-baked. {M0.He}{F0.She} decides this is {M0.his}{F0.her} chance and lunges for the animal.
Ah, that's better. See? {0.SimFirstName}'s fine. If {M0.he}{F0.she} really had Space Madness {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} start to panic randomly and make really bad decisions. OH NO!! The rocket's too HEAVY!! {0.SimFirstName} should start ejecting things immediately!
Deciding it must be a trap, {0.SimFirstName} cruises on, but soon {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel starts to run low. The radar still hasn’t picked up anything but the planet on the map. {0.SimFirstName} has little choice. Re-directing {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, {M0.he}{F0.she} lands in front of a lone tree growing on a cliff. The opening to a small tunnel lies beneath it. Go in?
That safest way to travel! As the drives activate, a flash of light flips the time polarity! {0.SimFirstName} is going the right way again, and needs to keep the time-stream intact! What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?!
The reptilians guide {0.SimFirstName} out of the nebula, but then come around to board {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket! Two towering Iguanoids pry open the hatch and rummage through {M0.his}{F0.her} things. Apparently {0.SimFirstName} doesn't have anything of value to them. They smash some panels and leave {0.SimFirstName} to {M0.his}{F0.her} broken devices.
Why slow down now? Fully engaging {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters, {0.SimFirstName} easily ditches the patrol. 4 Eyes is over the literal moon with excitement, but {0.SimFirstName} knows it's time to take {M0.his}{F0.her} friend home. {M0.He}{F0.She} even receives a nice reward from its mom as thanks. What a crazy Flea Market day!
Reversing back through the flotsam, the rocket drifts like a time-salmon against the relentless river of causality until it is surrounded by wreckage. What happened here?
By showing {M0.his}{F0.her} softer side, {0.SimFirstName} has won back the respect of the people, but obviously this &quot;alien overlord&quot; stuff isn't exactly {M0.his}{F0.her} strong suit. &quot;It's not you, it's me,&quot; {M0.he}{F0.she} tells the panicked aliens, heading back to {M0.his}{F0.her} ship.
The instant {0.SimFirstName} picks up a talisman, the ground starts rumbling. It’s a trap! Covering {M0.his}{F0.her} head, {M0.he}{F0.she} bolts from the temple just as the walls give way. {M0.He}{F0.She} makes it to {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and manages to get it airborne, but the ship has suffered critical damage. Although {0.SimFirstName} got {M0.his}{F0.her} artifact, this is going to be a rough landing.
{0.SimFirstName} comes across a purple specimen that seems to be breathing! Or maybe quivering? It's hard to tell, but it's moving at least. Suddenly, {M0.he}{F0.she} feels the whole ship shudder and rumble. Keep looking, or leave now?
“Don’t shoot! We surrender.” The Rebel leader doesn’t even have shoes, let alone weapons. {0.SimFirstName} is almost disappointed {M0.his}{F0.her} job is so easily completed! {M0.He}{F0.She} brings Yang Holmby the news and is rewarded handsomely for doing the government’s dirty work.
{0.SimFirstName} has never been violently ousted, but it doesn't sound like much fun, even when the subjects are nearly microscopic. {M0.He}{F0.She} beats a hasty exit and the aliens rejoice!
{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the station which is unusually dark. {M0.He}{F0.She} flips on a flashlight and is startled by a disheveled-looking astronaut. &quot;Thank goodness you came! Our main power coupling is shot. Is there anything you can do to help?&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} notices an odd, green-colored creature shaped like a plumbob. It doesn't seem to have realized that {0.SimFirstName} was nearby. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to communicate with it or watch quietly from a distance?
{0.SimFirstName} pries open the box and is nearly blinded by the glowing treasure inside! Better get it back quick. {0.SimFirstName} is trying to heave the heavy box onto {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulders when {M0.he}{F0.she} senses someone watching {0.SimPronounObjective}. Looking up, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees not two eyes, but hundreds. {0.SimFirstName} can try to explain {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of this, or run like crazy.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to attack a band of ruthless space pirates with {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Immediately they point the hugest, most scary-looking space cannon {0.SimFirstName}'s ever seen directly at {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and press FIRE. An ion beam surges into the prow of the ship. It begins belching a thick purple smoke, and {0.SimFirstName} has to retreat for home.
{0.SimFirstName} is suddenly feeling anxious and jumpy. There's a strange tingling sensation in {M0.his}{F0.her} hands and feet, and {M0.he}{F0.she} feels a little light-headed. Could {M0.he}{F0.she} have Space Madness?? Could be something wrong with the air flow...?
{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the satellite and notices it’s covered in a light pink goop! But why?! What… is … it?
{0.SimFirstName} is nearing the sun when {M0.he}{F0.she} spies an immense flying saucer with a jolly-looking alien wedged into the cockpit. The alien is manipulating some kind of phase beam to fire asteroids directly into the sun. As each asteroid hits, the sun flares and the alien laughs. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
In the distance, {0.SimFirstName} sees another ship blast its trash out the airlock - now all that space debris is hurtling {0.SimFirstName}’s way! A rusty waffle iron strikes {M0.his}{F0.her} craft and tears a hole in the fuselage. {0.SimFirstName} is sucked out into deep space! {M0.He}{F0.She} takes a moment to be thankful {M0.he}{F0.she} put on {M0.his}{F0.her} full space suit today. Now what?
Right! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} explores the debris and finds a treasure! Avoiding the time-edge, {F0.she}{M0.he} can safely return home!
Good thing {0.SimFirstName} has an expanded cargo bay. It's a lot of stuff to move (old concert tees, milk crate furniture, blacklight posters), but it all fits in pretty easily, and they blast off for Rompiter. The alien is so grateful, he gives {0.SimFirstName} his least-dirty futon mattress as thanks. {0.SimFirstName} incinerates it.
While tumbling head over heels, {0.SimFirstName} somehow manages to grab onto one of the ship's fins, and {M0.he}{F0.she} gradually pulls {M0.himself}{F0.herself} back into the ship. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s not floating  away into nothingness (which is good!), but {M0.his}{F0.her} ship still has a giant hole in the side (which is less good). What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
&quot;See, when you say threatening things, it makes me feel very unsafe,&quot; says {0.SimFirstName}. Good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} watched all those episodes of Celeb Talk Therapy on TV - {M0.he}{F0.she} knows the lingo! The pirates have a breakthrough and leave to go apologize to their mothers. They even leave {0.SimFirstName} a few bucks for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble.
While cruising comfortably somewhere in the vicinity of the Vega Startron, {0.SimFirstName} sees a banged-up escape pod drifting out of orbit. Lights are flickering - maybe something's inside? If {M0.he}{F0.she} brings it on board {M0.his}{F0.her}  ship, {M0.he}{F0.she} can see what it is. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could just use it for spare parts.
{0.SimFirstName} recalls a nifty trick. Pursing {M0.his}{F0.her} lips, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets out a shrill alien mating cry. The egomaniac pilot turns 2 eyes on the horizon and 1 on his mirror, losing sight of {0.SimFirstName} just long enough. {0.SimFirstName} lands another hit, tying the score as the clock runs out. Impressed, the alien says they should fight again soon. {0.SimFirstName} heads proudly home.
That's one small step for Sim, one slightly awkward, lunging step for Sim-kind. {0.SimFirstName} explores the lunar seas, the lunar rocks, and the other lunar rocks. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes some for the trip home.
So much for a change of scene. {0.SimFirstName} has no sooner landed than a government official waves {M0.him}{F0.her} in to see Yang Holmby, the Emperor. It isn’t easy to understand him through all his spluttering, but he insists that {0.SimFirstName} menace the colonists into submission. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} agree?
{0.SimFirstName}’s upgraded ship makes quick work of this arrogant extraterrestrial. Humbled by {0.SimFirstName}’s skill, the alien offers {0.SimPronounObjective} a reward beyond {M0.his}{F0.her} wildest imaginings! {0.SimFirstName} blasts home with {M0.his}{F0.her} prize before the alien can reconsider.
Well, there were no listening devices that {0.SimFirstName} could find. Good. The government agents don't seem to have tracked {M0.him}{F0.her}...so far. But {0.SimFirstName} needs to be sure.
Touchdown! The beagle has landed! {0.SimFirstName} is now safely on the moon. Should {F0.she}{M0.he} send out the scientific-looking probe, or get out there and explore the surface for {F0.her}{M0.him}self?
When the aliens see {0.SimFirstName} looming over them, they immediately fall to their knees and start chanting - they obviously think {M0.he's}{F0.she's} some sort of supreme being come to rule them. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} stick around a while, or just be on {M0.his}{F0.her} way?
{0.SimFirstName} pulls up to the extermination station drive-thru and begins to explain the situation to the guys at the window. Unfortunately, the sobbing has gotten louder—MUCH louder. Unconvinced that {0.SimFirstName} has a sobbing rat on board, they refuse to help. Now what?
Wooh! Free jewels! {0.SimFirstName} snatches the valuable rocks as the crowd gives a standing ovation to {M0.his}{F0.her} prudent sense of value. “The creature had passed the trials! May {M0.his}{F0.her} species flourish and grow!” {M0.he}{F0.she} hears, before being materialized safely back in {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, already nearing home.
From the swamp, {0.SimFirstName} pulls some kind of fish. The creature smiles. “Typically given only during a mating ritual, this is,” he says, “but ignore that for now, I will.” The final trial is to explore the Evil Cave. The creature gives {0.SimFirstName} a weapon, then oddly stresses that {M0.he}{F0.she} will not need it.
Ugh, NOW the aliens are angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for ignoring them. Don't they understand that {0.SimFirstName}'s just not the murdering type? Being a deity really is a lose-lose proposition. {0.SimFirstName}'s so frustrated with their pettiness that {M0.he}{F0.she} just leaves. What a waste of time.
Yeehaw! Nothing like a wide-eyed kid to make {0.SimFirstName} feel like a hero. And with four eyes the effect is doubled! After a speedrace around Planet Toomootoo and a few stellar flips, {M0.he}{F0.she} deposits 4 Eyes at home and receives a nice reward from its mom.
{0.SimFirstName} hails Tech Support on the comm. A recorded voice says, &quot;Your call is important to us. We will be with you within one galactic cycle.&quot; A galactic cycle is a measurement of time equal to 394 Sim years. Infuriating music plays.
{0.SimFirstName} fires {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's blasters at the creature, which immediately shatters into a bajillion pieces. {0.SimFirstName} gathers some of the pieces and leaves, quickly.
{0.SimFirstName} takes aim with the standard cannons and attempts to shoot off the goop! It seemed to work a little bit as some of the pink substance floats off into space, but that could have been a disaster.
{0.SimFirstName} is too smart for them! That chair is on one of those moving platforms! As the crowd applauds {0.SimFirstName}’s wisdom and foresight, the chair sinks down into the dark recesses in the floor, replaced by the next challenge. This pedestal is made of solid gold, and contains valuable looking jewels!
Disappointed, the alien offers {0.SimFirstName} some choice pieces of space junk if {M0.he}{F0.she} will come back and duel later. Knowing {M0.his}{F0.her} ship isn’t fully equipped to beat this hotshot, {0.SimFirstName} takes the junk and promises to return, once {M0.he}{F0.she} has traded it for some key upgrades. {M0.He}{F0.She} turns {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, relieved, toward home.
{0.SimFirstName} speaks in {M0.his}{F0.her} most comforting, non-threatening voice and explains to the pirates how very disappointed {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} be if they stranded {M0.him}{F0.her} in deep space. But these pirates didn't get where they are by being empathetic, so they tear the wiring out of {M0.his}{F0.her} vermenticular fusion box. Hmm...might be a little hard to land the ship without that.
{0.SimFirstName} and the trader load up the ship and {0.SimFirstName} blasts away. {M0.He}{F0.She} heads for home - it's smooth sailing, there's no traffic in the asteroid belt, and {0.SimFirstName}'s even getting pretty good gas mileage. Plus, {0.SimFirstName} is on track for a sweet payday when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets home! 
{0.SimFirstName} smashes the rebels (quite literally - {M0.he}{F0.she} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe). But with the strongest of the aliens destroyed, things don't look so good for their civilization. {0.SimFirstName} leaves before {M0.he}{F0.she} can be blamed for some kind of extinction event.
When {0.SimFirstName} wakes up, {M0.he}{F0.she} is lying on the asphalt next to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship with a sore arm. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound is locked, and the only response to {M0.his}{F0.her} knocks is barking. On {M0.his}{F0.her} way home, flashes of the incident return: a burly guard, a gleaming needle. Maybe {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} try again another time.
{0.SimFirstName}'s wrath is truly fearsome! The aliens are terrified of their capricious, angry deity. But it turns out that being an angry deity doesn't win you many friends. A few hardy rebels band together to try to drive {0.SimFirstName} away forever. How should {0.SimFirstName} deal with this uprising?
Thanks to {0.SimFirstName}’s focus, {F0.her}{M0.his} aim was impeccable and all the goop was shot off!
{0.SimFirstName} is just biting into {M0.his}{F0.her} astronaut ice cream sandwich when {M0.he}{F0.she} spots a small craft that seems to be hailing {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Is someone in trouble? {0.SimFirstName} blasts in for a closer look.
Ah yes. Turn it off and then turn it back on. The preferred tech solution of professional rocket scientists everywhere. The dynotherms sputter and a new message appears: &quot;Your dynotherms did not shut down properly. Would you like to restart your dynotherms in Safe Mode?&quot;
The guard injects {0.SimFirstName}'s arm with a long shiny needle, then leads {M0.him}{F0.her} into the pound, which consists of floor after floor of caged beasts—mostly large, growling earth mutts. “First 69 floors,” the guard says. {0.SimFirstName} can start looking for Fitz—or look for a way back to that leash at the front desk.
The round ball deftly slides into the round hole, and the room erupts into ferocious applause! {0.SimFirstName} instinctively bows graciously as the puzzle recedes back into the floor, replaced by a new one.  This next rising pedestal has… a hat?  Yes, it’s a very fine hat, perhaps a derby! What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
{0.SimFirstName} wakes up in a groggy haze, covered with freeze-dried crumbs. {M0.He}{F0.She} notices the lights are so BRIGHT in here, and the color of the rocket walls is way too GREEN. This is unacceptable. It'll attract Xargons! How should {0.SimFirstName} avoid the Xargons?
{0.SimFirstName} does {M0.his}{F0.her} best to scale the impossible terrain, but it proves too difficult. {M0.He}{F0.She} resolves to get more exercise when (if) {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back home. The western valley is the only way left to go now, but the light is starting to fade…
{0.SimFirstName} sets to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot. Reboot. Yes! There it is—a signal at last! {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts off—and just in time, too. An army of spidery aliens has covered the hillside and fires at {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Good thing {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got these trusty thrusters. {0.SimFirstName} is free, clear and on {M0.his}{F0.her} way home in no time!
It's been a while since {0.SimFirstName} had to hotwire anything. Wait...does {M0.he}{F0.she} know how to hotwire stuff or was that a guy on TV? Oh well, how hard can it be, right? Now is it red-wire-to-blue-wire, or red-wire-to-green-wire?
Those pathetic pirates practically trip over each other in order to get out of {0.SimFirstName}'s way. But before they go, they wash {0.SimFirstName}'s windshield and give {0.SimPronounObjective} a quick oil change, just to stay on {M0.his}{F0.her} good side.
Using some paper clips, half a box of aluminum foil, and a plunger, {0.SimFirstName} manages to cobble together a new power coupling. Upon installing it, the space station hums back to life. The crew is very grateful.
{0.SimFirstName} acts fast. Heaving the box onto {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulders, {M0.he}{F0.she} crams it into {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo hold, but can’t resist a peek before  working on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Treasure—mounds of it! Someone will be looking for this soon. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} can sense a rumbling in the distance which seems to be getting closer…
One by one {0.SimFirstName} starts ejecting the escape pods from {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, watching them drift off into space. But the ship is still too heavy! Why is it so heavy? Something else has to go. {0.SimFirstName} starts panicking, because if the ship is too heavy it will definitely crash!
Harsh words, insults, and finally, salutations are taken back as the conversation undoes itself. An interesting experience for sure. What happened just before this?
{0.SimFirstName} is still choking on the alien spacecraft’s exhaust when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears sirens blaring in the distance. The space police surround {0.SimFirstName}’s rocket ship and demand to search {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo bay. {M0.He}{F0.She} can turn over the goods and hope for the best, or help the alien—and possibly {M0.himself}{F0.herself}—by hiding it.
{0.SimFirstName} calls out. No answer. The only sound is a soft dripping. Donning {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty headlamp, {M0.he}{F0.she} treads quietly into the tunnel, deeper and deeper until {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a beam of light coming through a crack in the ceiling. Under it is a locked box! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} pry it open here or bring it back to the ship?
{0.SimFirstName} staggers toward {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, one hand dragging the catalyzer, the other gripping the wound in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. It’s not far now, but {0.SimName} suddenly hears a low growl. A very large creature has crept up behind {0.SimPronounObjective}. It’s a mad dash to the safety of the ship! Then again, the catalyzer has a good heft… could be used as a weapon.
So far, so good. Ever since {0.SimFirstName} braced the door, the cargo hold has been silent. If {M0.he}{F0.she} can make it to a pest extermination station, {M0.he}{F0.she} can get the problem taken care of and be on {M0.his}{F0.her} way. But then a new sound starts. Small. Sad. Sobbing? Does {0.SimFirstName} stick to {M0.his}{F0.her} guns, or peek in the hold?
It's Fitz! Before the aliens can stop {0.SimPronounObjective}, {0.SimFirstName} is out the door with the prized pooch and on the way to collect {M0.his}{F0.her} reward! A quick call to the Galactic Rangers on the way should take care of the pound's illegal animal trade.
With the stabilizers {0.SimFirstName} installed, {M0.he}{F0.she} is able to retain some control of the ship. It just barely misses a formation of sharp-looking rocks and lands roughly in a swamp a few miles beyond. Struggling onto dry land, {0.SimFirstName} wonders how {M0.he}{F0.she} is going to get the rocket out of the muck and back into space…
{0.SimFirstName} returns from the jungle with a modest pile of berries. “Know these were poisonous, did you?” the creature asks before shoving several into his mouth. “Mah favrite,” he sputters through a mushy mouthful. The final trial is to explore the Evil Cave. He gives {0.SimFirstName} a weapon, then oddly stresses that {M0.he}{F0.she} will not need it.
As the conversation plays back in reverse, though it sounds like gibberish, {0.SimFirstName} can detect where it all might have gone wrong. What happened just before this?
It's just a person-sized hole in the hull. So it's not perfectly sealed. So it might let in stray meteors and space contaminants. So {0.SimFirstName}'s combustible little body might go up in flames as the ship re-enters the atmosphere. {M0.He}{F0.She} can make this landing, right? Right?
Oh, why didn't {0.SimFirstName} spring for the extra-tacky coating on {M0.his}{F0.her} space gloves? Breathing heavily {M0.he}{F0.she} bounces down the body of the ship, desperate grabs failing to find purchase. Finally {M0.he}{F0.she} gets hold of some cables, ripping the hydraulic line for the ship's stabilizers. The ship automatically activates its emergency beacon.
Ouch. {0.SimFirstName}’s head hurts, and when {M0.he}{F0.she} tries to move, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} handcuffed to {M0.his}{F0.her} pilot seat. A sharp, cold object is poking {M0.his}{F0.her} back. “T-t-take me home,” a voice stammers. It’s oddly deep—and {0.SimFirstName} realizes it’s a juvenile voice trying to sound older. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} comply or try to reason with the juvenile?
Well, looks like even the pound has its processes. Having made up a story about losing {M0.his}{F0.her} mutt, {0.SimFirstName} fills out {M0.his}{F0.her} 13 forms while waiting for an escort to the cages. {M0.He}{F0.She} is handing them in when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a small red leash—much like in Fitz’s photo—sticking out of a box under the desk. What now?
{0.SimFirstName} did what was asked of {0.SimPronounObjective}. There’s no point risking {M0.his}{F0.her} life for cell phone data. As long as this satellite is left unharmed, then it was a success.
Thinking quickly, {0.SimFirstName} offers the child some treasure if it will tell {0.SimPronounObjective} which planet {M0.he}{F0.she} has landed on. Now {0.SimFirstName} can radio in {M0.his}{F0.her} location and get directions home! Rewarding the child, {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts off with the bulk of {M0.his}{F0.her} treasure still intact. Clever!
{0.SimFirstName} sets to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot. Reboot. Yes! A signal at last. {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts off—and just in time, too. An army of spidery aliens has covered the hillside and opens fire. Pushing {M0.his}{F0.her} engines to the limit, {0.SimFirstName} gets free, but not without sustaining a few hits to {M0.his}{F0.her} thermal system. This’ll be a rocky landing…
{0.SimFirstName}'s instruments go haywire and {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship is bathed in purple light. Purple and gold dust coats the sky as far as the eye can see—which isn't that far. {M0.He}{F0.She} must have drifted into a giant nebula! {0.SimFirstName} can send out a call for help, or forge ahead and hope the instruments can sort it out.
{0.SimFirstName} finally returns to the ship, exhausted. The alien part had made a pretty good club, stunning the giant beast with one solid whack. It gave {0.SimFirstName} just enough time to find a place to hide until the injured creature finally staggered away. Now to repair the ship, dress these wounds, and get back home!
This creature is surprisingly slippery, even by slimy alien standards! {0.SimFirstName} just can't keep ahold of it and it gets away and starts chewing through some electrical cables. Hmm… hope {0.SimFirstName} wasn't going to need those cables for the journey home....
Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} scans the wreck, gaining invaluable scientific knowledge. Avoiding the time-edge, {F0.she}{M0.he} safely makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way home.
Ugh, {0.SimFirstName} feels even worse now. This isn't good--it definitely sounds like Space Madness. The next symptom is making really bad decisions. If {M0.he}{F0.she} just concentrates {M0.he}{F0.she} should be okay. Now...how to fix the air flow?
The fresh air really helped, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} feels better. If {0.SimFirstName} actually had Space Madness {M0.he}{F0.she}'d start getting paranoid and making really terrible decisions. Now...how to spend the day up here in space?
{0.SimFirstName} shines {M0.his}{F0.her} flashlight on the cropland, and the plants grow taller than ever! The aliens are so happy that they invent painting, music, and philosophy. With civilization progressing so well, {0.SimFirstName} figures that {M0.his}{F0.her} work is done. {M0.He}{F0.She} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship and heads home.
{0.SimFirstName}'s leg is starting to cramp.  {M0.He}{F0.She} is crouched in the Cosmic Relief stairwell, and {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been watching the front desk for what feels like forever. Finally, the alien stands, scratches, checks something under the desk and seems to say something before waddling off. Gotcha! It's now or never.
After dismantling {M0.his}{F0.her} bunk for extra sheet metal, {0.SimFirstName} patches the hole! The inside pressure stabilizes and it looks like the ship will make it back to Earth! Some of the debris could be valuable... at the very least, {0.SimFirstName} can Internet-shame the litterbug who got {0.SimPronounObjective} into this mess. {M0.He}{F0.She} collects a scoopful and sets course for home.
Hmm, {0.SimFirstName} really doesn't have a big enough cargo bay. The alien's got a lot of incense burners and bottle koozies, and they might not all fit in the ship. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to just cram it in there, or give up?
{0.SimFirstName} slowly opens the door and peers inside. Just then, something soft and squishy thumps onto {M0.his}{F0.her} back and a tentacle threads around {M0.his}{F0.her} neck. “Don’t move!” a small voice whispers. Everything goes black. {0.SimFirstName} faints, which is technically moving.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't remember much, but thinks {F0.she}{M0.he} may have been abducted! {M0.He}{F0.She} now stands in a small, sterile arena. A motley assemblage of hideous beings sits, furtively, in the bleachers. Slowly, a pedestal rises from the floor; it contains two items: a ball, and a container with two holes, one round and one triangular. The room is tense with excitement.
&quot;Ship repairs,&quot; {0.SimFirstName} carefully enunciates into the comm. &quot;You have selected: Self Destruct,&quot; the voice says, &quot;Remotely engaging your ship's self destruct function now.&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} slides into place at the starting line. To {M0.his}{F0.her} right, a souped up XR315 piloted by a female canine-sapien. To {M0.his}{F0.her} left, a brawny alien revving the engine of his TS-555, his sneer revealing a row of sparkling red teeth. Bang! The starting gun fires and they’re off!
The grizzled old trader has an offer for {0.SimFirstName} - deliver some of his cargo back to Earth, and {0.SimFirstName} can keep some of it! {M0.He}{F0.She} can use it {F0.her}{M0.him}self or make big bucks selling it. The cargo bay is pretty large, so {0.SimFirstName} accepts the offer.
{0.SimFirstName} carefully guides the rocket into orbit over a small alien world, but it’s clear right away that something is wrong. Ionic interference in the planet’s thermosphere is causing havoc with the ship’s primary systems. {0.SimFirstName} decides to attempt an emergency landing, which is smart since {M0.he}{F0.she} has no other choice…
The aliens will never again want for water! {0.SimFirstName} is so benevolent! The aliens sing {M0.his}{F0.her} praises. Now they're praying to {0.SimPronounObjective} for more land for their fields and livestock.
That would explain it. As {0.SimFirstName} gets closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that an alien spaceship is being pulled towards a massive black hole! {0.SimFirstName} offers to transport the owner of the ship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, but the alien begs {0.SimPronounObjective} to save the whole ship. “I’ll reward you! Pleeeeease!” Should {M0.he}{F0.she} risk it?
It’s a tight squeeze, but {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship lands without a scratch. Instantly it’s surrounded by blue furry creatures! They’re small—about the size of a common house cat—but {0.SimFirstName} has never seen anything quite as toothy, and there are hundreds of them. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to capture one alive, or euthanize one and bring it back for analysis?
Promising to infiltrate the government’s food replicators, {0.SimFirstName} blasts off for the planet. As soon as {M0.he}{F0.she} lands, a government official waves {0.SimPronounObjective} in to see the Emperor, Yang Holmby. Warning him of the Rebel plot, {0.SimFirstName} quashes the revolution—and receives a handsome reward for {M0.his}{F0.her} help.
Whoa, that escalated quickly. But {0.SimFirstName}'s quick offensive strike took the pirates by surprise, and they crumble into a teary, blubbering puddle. They even offer {0.SimFirstName} some spare wires and loose change to entice {M0.him}{F0.her} to leave them alone.
{0.SimFirstName} sees a large ship floating silently ahead - it looks abandoned, or at least very poorly maintained. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to board it to see what's inside, or just use the robotronic arm to collect some spare parts from the outside?
After wandering for a very long time, {0.SimFirstName} discovers a wrecked ship similar in structure to {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent}! There’s even a part that could possibly replace the catalyzer! Unfortunately, when {0.SimFirstName} pulls it free, the wreckage shifts and a piece of jagged metal leaves a deep cut in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. Better get back to the ship quickly…
The debris reassembles into a fierce pirate ship, while laserblasts spawn and retract into their respective blasters! An epic battle un-ensues, and the ships drift further apart. Communications become active; what did {0.SimFirstName} say to the pirate captain?!
*Bzzt* {0.SimFirstName}! Come in!*bzzt* &#xD;&#xA;Commander Vanderwander needs {M0.his}{F0.her} help! There is a satellite out in orbit that is malfunctioning. Millions of Sims are complaining about their poor cell phone data coverage! They want to post pics of their food, their kittens, and their profound fortune cookies but can’t! The commander needs {0.SimFirstName} to take a look!
These mountains would break most Sims, but thanks to {0.SimFirstName}’s good physical condition, {M0.he}{F0.she} eventually makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way to the summit. The curl of smoke {M0.he}{F0.she} spotted earlier is pouring from an alien ship! {0.SimFirstName} might be able to pilot it out of here, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could try scavenging a suitable part for {M0.his}{F0.her} own ship.
Praise to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} drags a table near the toilet so the alien colony can expand. Now that the aliens have all the land they need to build and grow, they seem to be doing okay. {0.SimFirstName} leaves on a high note.
This is not going well at all. Dog Girl has taken the lead, but instead of chasing her, Red Tooth seems intent on menacing {0.SimFirstName}, maneuvering to block {M0.him}{F0.her} at every turn. Could they be working together? Regardless, {0.SimFirstName} is tired of looking up Red Tooth’s tail-lights. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to blast him out of the way or play fair?
Since {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.his}{F0.her} way around a machine, it doesn’t take long to figure out the alien components. There’s a part not unlike a catalyzer that should do the trick, and it looks like {M0.he}{F0.she} can still get back to the ship before night falls. Time to head home.
When {0.SimFirstName} clicks the &quot;Update&quot; button to update the dynotherm drivers, a helpful message appears saying the request cannot be completed because the dynotherm drivers have not been updated.
After a long walk, {0.SimFirstName} finally sees signs of life. {M0.He}{F0.She} appears to have discovered a large camp, filled with little creatures bustling about and trading small bits of junk they’ve scavenged from various crash sites. One little merchant near {M0.him}{F0.her} has a part that would be a suitable replacement for the catalyzer. But how to obtain it...?
Oh, all-powerful {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} truly must have a master plan, chant the grateful aliens. They're so happy that {M0.he's}{F0.she's} chosen to help them rebuild their society. Maybe being benevolent is the better way to rule?
{0.SimFirstName} stares down at a formidable tower on a red planet. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound isn’t just a fable. It’s real! {0.SimFirstName} is searching for Mrs. Foozzin’s prized pookapoo—a rare breed of space dog that could bring big bucks on the black market. It will bring big bucks to {0.SimFirstName}, too, if {M0.he}{F0.she} brings it home unscathed.
The old trader's ship is overflowing with cargo--he offers to let {0.SimFirstName} keep some of the cargo if {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll transport the rest to his buyer on Earth. {0.SimFirstName}'s ship's cargo bay isn't very large, and the extra weight could crash {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} risk it, or just take a little bit of the goods?
{0.SimFirstName} suits up, opens the doors, and floats toward the satellite. As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets closer, {0.SimFirstName} notices that there are...sprinkles in the goop? What?! {0.SimFirstName} pulls out {M0.his}{F0.her} space shammy and wipes some off. {M0.He}{F0.She} sniffs it and then takes a taste. It's frosting! {0.SimFirstName} takes a sample for lab analysis (and for a snack) then returns to the ship.
So much better… Free of handcuffs, {0.SimFirstName} sizes up the creature {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} bought as taxidermy—it’s just a stupid juvenile that was dared by its brother to pretend! Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy and a free lift home. {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} could get charged with alien-napping, but {M0.he}{F0.she} did promise…
No one answers {0.SimFirstName}’s distress call. This massive ball of dust and gas must be absorbing all comm signals. There’s nothing to do but forge forward and hope {M0.he}{F0.she} can get free before {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel’s gone!
Well, this is going...not great. {0.SimFirstName}'s ship crashes spectacularly into the surface of the planet. According to the damage diagnostic, the ship won't be safe to fly until {0.SimFirstName} can replace the catalyzer on the port compression coil. It's a nothing part--until you don't have one. {0.SimFirstName} steps out of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and begins the search.
Without water for their crops, the tiny, helpless aliens start to wither away. In order to appease their deity, they start sacrificing some of their pets and livestock at a tiny temple, where they've drawn a crude picture of {0.SimFirstName}'s face.
{0.SimFirstName} pilots {M0.his}{F0.her} ship to a remote rest-stop, but just as {0.SimFirstName} is about to pry open the first crate, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a small red flashing light. A tracker! Just then the alien knocks at {M0.his}{F0.her} window. As the smuggler unloads his stuff, he slips {0.SimFirstName} a small package in thanks before vanishing in a cloud of exhaust.
{0.SimFirstName} sees some unsavory characters approaching fast in {M0.his}{F0.her} rearview mirror...uh oh! Those are space pirates, and {0.SimFirstName}'s about to be shipjacked. They demand a suitcase full of Simoleons to let {0.SimFirstName} pass...OR ELSE.
{0.SimFirstName} waits for the alien to search her computer for record of Fitz, the pookapoo. Apparently nothing comes up. The alien hands back the photo and claims to have dogs to feed. But she doesn’t get up. {0.SimFirstName} notices a small red leash—much like in Fitz’s photo—sticking out of a box under the desk. What now?
Correct! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} zooms through the cosmos, and approaches an unknown vessel. Communications open; what should {M0.he}{F0.she} say?!
Turns out it IS that kind of race! {0.SimFirstName} gets a lock on Red Tooth and fires {M0.his}{F0.her} ion cannons, sending Red Tooth’s TS-555 hurtling off the track. {0.SimFirstName} easily closes the distance between {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and Dog Girl, blasting past her for the win and the top prize!
{0.SimFirstName} maneuvers the ship into the path of the space rock. With some clever flying, {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to deflect the asteroid off the ship's plating, causing it to fly harmlessly back into space. That was close!
The tank is no match for the powerful laser on {0.SimFirstName}'s rocket. ZZZZZT! It incinerates in a cloud of metal dust. Looks like {M0.he's}{F0.she's} outsmarted the government agents on {M0.his}{F0.her} trail. What's {0.SimFirstName}'s next move in this high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse?
{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} surprise advantage to land the first hit, but it goes downhill from there. Note to self: never duel an alien with 14 more hands than you! The extra-handed extraterrestrial unleashes a wall of missile fire, and judging by the smoke and warning lights, {0.SimFirstName}’s ship has been hit! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} retreat, or fight to regain {M0.his}{F0.her} edge?

{0.SimFirstName}'s possessions have been repossessed, and are no longer {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent} anymore. This has somewhat helped {0.SimPronounObjective} to dig {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of debt. However, if {M0.he}{F0.she} still owes more money, {M0.he}{F0.she} had better pay it or else {M0.he}{F0.she} can expect more visits from the friendly neighborhood Repo Person.

You can't fool me, this is {0.SimName} I'm talking to! Next time try pranking someone a little more gullible.
What are you talking about? I didn't place an ad for a three-legged llama for sale! No, you can't come pick it up!
Wow, I won the grand prize? I didn't even enter the contest. I can't wait for my award to show up!
A shipment of 100 llamas is coming to my house? I didn't order that. There must be some kind of mistake!
What's that? Speak up, I can't hear you... Actually I can hear you, and I know you're playing a prank on me!
Oh very funny {0.SimFirstName}, try your prank calls somewhere else next time!
A what?! At my house right now? I've, uh, I've gotta go {0.SimFirstName}!

Ask About Triple Boost Week
Greetings, This Event period is being celebrated with Boosts! All the Boosts! Ask me for a Boost, and I shall bestow upon you the one which you desire.
Triple Boost Week is here, but it won't be available for long... Take advantage of the wondrous boost I have to offer!\n\nTruth be told, I fancy myself a bit of a matchmaker. To that end, I've brought along a boost to all of your relationship gains. No matter if your relationship is passionate or platonic, I'm here to help. Simply ask for my boost and you'll be making friends... or friends with benefits... in no time. Now get out there and turn on the charm!
Triple boost week has arrived again, and the clock is ticking on your time to take advantage of these marvelous boosts.\n\nI present to you an intriguing proposition... Do you rocket your Satisfaction Points upwards with a 3x boost to all points gained when completing whims? Or, do you slow down all need decay by 3x, effectively giving yourself more free time to do with as you please?\n\nThe choice is yours! Ask for a boost and I'll happily grant it. Remember, you can change your active boost at any time - I'm always just a phone call away.
Hey there little one! What's that? You want to know about this Triple Boost Week you keep hearing adults whispering about? I'm not sure I should be the one to explain the birds and the bees...\n\nActually, hold on. I've got a special version of this week's boost I can offer you. Just ask me for a boost to relationship gain and you'll find that you'll gather friendship with others three times faster. Why not try it out right now? Grab my boost and scamper along to the playground; you'll have new friends to play with in a snap!
I'm here to help you eat better food, stink less, and express yourself more! Ask for a boost and I’ll happily grant it for a healthy length of time. Of course, you can change your boost at any time. Just call me and ask for another.\n\nI have three options! You can improve your gardening and cooking skill gain – yum yum! Alternatively, you can increase your handiness, painting, and photography skill gain to help you dabble in the arts. Or perhaps you simply wish to spend more time outside? No worries, I can reduce your hunger and hygiene decay. So, what’ll it be?&#xD;&#xA;

Mega Window (Double Budget Grand Deluxe DeLite)
We produced this window by combining the plans for all of our other Mega Windows. It’s pretty good quality, a great size, decently attractive… It’s not necessarily everything you want but it’s certainly none of the things that you don’t want! Buy dozens!
Mega Window (Reverse Shutter)
Thanks to an error that flipped the blueprint image we scanned into the database of our assembly line robots, we have manufactured thousands of windows with the shutter attached to the wrong side. Use with our original shuttered Mega Window to create a nice symmetrical look.
Mega Window (Shutter)
We wanted a window that would practically scream “handmade antique.” That’s why we programmed our battery of assembly line robots to add a quaint wooden shutter to our popular Mega Window. You won’t believe the hands that made it were 40% tungsten!
The Craftsman
Simple yet decorative, these hand-carved wooden windows add beauty to any Craftsman home.
Mega Window
99.9% of our antique windows are mass produced on our assembly line; however, as a special promotion, we had an actual human artisan come in and hand carve 100 Mega Windows. We won’t tell you which ones are his, but if you buy enough to cover your house there’s a good chance you get at least one, right?
Mega Window (Cloverleaf)
This window is the result of a design challenge. We asked our assembly line robots to produce something that would let in as little light as possible but still be considered a “window” by human standards. Despite the rather subjective requirements of the test they did quite well!
Mega Window (Double Budget DeLite)
What’s that you say? Six panes of Glaz aren’t enough? You want even more of our proprietary glass substitute in your antique window? Well say no more. We had our assembly line robots stick two Mega Windows together using the finest wood glue on the market. Now you can show all the neighbors that you’re a twelve-paner!
Mega Window (Budget DeLite)
For the budget-conscious consumer with a taste for antiques, we offer the Budget DeLite version of our popular Mega Window. Carved from discarded holiday trees that we buy in bulk, each window features 6 panes of Glaz, our semi-transparent glass substitute.
Mega Window (Budget DeLuxe)
If you like your windows to be a piece of glass in a wooden frame, oh boy, have we got the window for you! This is the window that gets manufactured when we press the “Test” button after rebooting our assembly line robots.
Arch You Happy to See Me?
This dramatic architectural feature is both arresting and appreciated.
Mega Window (Grand Deluxe)
Robots have difficulty with the concept of human excess, but we were able to work around that by swapping their definitions for “efficient” and “inefficient.” Now our window-crafting bots have been able to manufacture our grandest window yet, the Mega Window Grand Deluxe!
Mega Window (Double Grand)
We asked the AI for our assembly line robots how it could construct a window that was twice as good as the Grand Mega Window, and it produced this in reply. We’re still not sure if it was being sarcastic or not.
Mega Window (Grand)
It turns out that robots are incredibly good at breaking glass. When we realized our assembly line robots smashed 30% of the windows they constructed, we found a simple solution: program them to feel deep shame whenever they break a window. Now we get beauties like this Grand Mega Window without so much as a chip in the glass!
Mega Window (Double Deluxe)
At MegaMission Outdoor Warehouse, every one of our antique windows and doors is made by hand by assembly line robots. Now, thanks to a slight error in a recursive function in their deluxe window-crafting program, we have produced thousands of high quality double windows. Some of the greatest inventions were born from simple errors!
Old Meets View
Add an air of old world charm with an eye-catching, mission-style arched window.
Mega Window (Deluxe)
People always ask us how we are able to make such a narrow window at such high quality. The answer is simple! When we program our assembly line robots to make windows, we set both “narrow” and “high quality” to true!
Glacemaster 1700C - Combo
No proper fenestrator could go without the Glacemaster 1700C--supreme among household windows. The Combo version.
The Lofty Looker
The epitome of urban chic, this extra-tall window is ideal for lofts, warehouses and other repurposed spaces.

Moon Panda Toy
&lt;i&gt;This toy was granted for the New Lunar Year of the Pig, starting in February 2019.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAs the animals celebrated the New Lunar Year within the grand hall, the Panda sat alone outside. He did not receive an invitation, and thought it disrespectful of him to join the party.\n\nHe soon left and wandered to the riverside. Among the bamboo reeds along the water's edge, he sighed so loudly, a river spirit heard his cry. “Why so forlorn?” the spirit asked. At the end of the Panda's tale, the spirit told the Panda, “I will not allow you to be forgotten…”  Moonlight bathed the Panda, and the surrounding bamboo reeds sprouted buds in the shape of little pandas.\n\nLater, children plucked the panda-shaped bamboo, painted them with favorite colors at home, and shared them with other children. Somewhere else, the Panda smiled, and continued chewing a bamboo stalk.
Rubber Ducky makes bath time fun.
Classic Wood-Mobile
While not the classic sports car look, this toy has that toddler favorite style called wood. It's durable for any crash that might happen while playing.
Butterfly McButterflyface
It doesn't actually fly, but if it did how majestic would that be? It's not a problem since the imagination of a child can turn any ordinary object into a mythical creature with a funny name.

Not-Grass Grass &lt;i&gt;Sans Inflorescence&lt;/i&gt;

Captain Chaz MacFreeling Porthole Mirror
Princess Cordelia’s second pirate boyfriend was handsome and, relative to other pirates, had good hygiene! Things started off great, but the princess noticed him looking in the mirror all the time; so vain. She promptly sent him on his way, giving him a handful of citrus for any future scurvy outbreaks, and naming all her mirrors after him.
Imprisoned Vanity Mirror
No matter how long the Princess called the Eppsilon home, it was nonetheless a submersible, and like all submersibles, it was made of cold, unforgiving metal. In her sadder moments-most often after dumping a pirate boyfriend-Princess Cordelia favored this hostile glass, which reminded her of her tragic fate. Sigh.

Talking to this client might get on {0.SimFirstName}'s nerves, but a job is a job. Completing all of {F0.her}{M0.his} tasks on time in the face of overwhelming pretentiousness is the mark of a true professional!
The movers and shakers of the modern world might speak in a strange way, but they know what they're doing. Very appreciative of {0.SimFirstName}'s quick turnaround, the company rewarded {F0.her}{M0.him} with a very nice bonus, as well as a promise that {F0.she}{M0.he} has helped change the world.
&quot;We're never going to experience the future with this kind of work...&quot;\n\nIt was harsh to hear, but it's true. Not finishing the job is bad enough, but it's devastating to such visionaries. {0.SimFirstName} managed to work out a deal of a prorated amount of pay by using these words.
Sometimes the best things in life come from accidents. This turned out to be one of them. The client was very pleased with the completion of the job, and wrote a very nice recommendation for {0.SimFirstName}. It can't really be used because it was obviously written with voice to text, but it's the thought that counts.
The seemingly accidental job posting turned out to be for a highly anticipated product. The speedy completion of the landing pages helped the organization of the marketing plan immensely, and {0.SimFirstName} was given a nice bonus for {F0.her}{M0.his} efforts.
Given that the job posting seemed unintentional, {0.SimFirstName} was surprised that the client seemed very upset when it wasn't finished. {F0.She}{M0.He} was even more surprised when {F0.she}{M0.he} received a payment anyway. It's a small amount, but it's better than nothing!
Adding another e-commerce website into the abyss is a risky business strategy. Still, the company launched {0.SimFirstName}'s work and released it to the world. Only time will tell if it is successful.
After {0.SimFirstName}'s website was approved, the e-commerce startup immediately got to work. Turns out, they're actually very competent and the website caught on. For {F0.her}{M0.his} speedy completion of the job, the company gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a small portion of their initial sales as a bonus!
{0.SimFirstName} couldn't deliver the promised website by the deadline, so the project was canceled. Trying to maintain the image of a real business, the e-commerce startup paid a prorated amount for the time spent on the project.
&quot;Any day now!&quot; The hopeful cryptominer was pleased with the delivery of the viruses, and immediately set to work. {0.SimFirstName} received {F0.her}{M0.his} payment and tried {F0.her}{M0.his} best to ignore the increasingly desperate updates the client keeps sending.
So it turns out SimCoin is real, and actively traded. It took an amazingly short amount of time for the client to report finding their first SimCoin. Thanking {0.SimFirstName} for the speed of {F0.her}{M0.his} delivery, the anonymous individual transferred over the payment with a nice bonus on top.
The shady individual didn't enjoy the news that {0.SimFirstName} couldn't provide the promised viruses. Still, the mysterious persona claimed that they were going to be rich soon anyway, so they still paid a modest amount for the time spent.
{0.SimFirstName} is doing {F0.her}{M0.his} part in making the world a safer place. At least, that's what the antivirus company keeps saying in their correspondence. That's nice and all, but the pay is even better! 
The antivirus company was thrilled with the speed and diligence of {0.SimFirstName}'s work. They wanted to send {F0.her}{M0.him} a medal, but {F0.she}{M0.he} insisted that the payment would be enough. Eventually, they settled on a decently sized bonus. Everyone is happy!
The antivirus company wasn't pleased that {0.SimFirstName} couldn't deliver anything to help with their research, but still gave a portion of the pay as they don't blame anyone for &quot;not wanting to fall to the dark&quot; as they said.
{0.SimFirstName} completed the job and delivered those viruses. {F0.She}{M0.He} doesn't need to know what that company wants to use them for. Things will be fine! Perfectly fine, as long as the money transaction goes through. You can't wire dirty money, right?
The speed that {0.SimFirstName} finished those viruses actually intimidated even the less than angelic company. Clearly, they're dealing with a malware professional, and need to be careful. Still, a job well done needs to be rewarded, and the company added a decent bonus on top of the payment.
Maybe {0.SimFirstName}'s conscience got the better of {F0.her}{M0.him}. Maybe {F0.she}{M0.he} just isn't good with making malicious software. Either way, the totally safe and legal company paid a small amount to keep {F0.her}{M0.him} quiet.
The client was overjoyed with the prepared spreadsheet. The formulas were all functional, the filters were all in place, and the cells were almost artistically spaced. {0.SimFirstName} received congratulations for a job well done!
Once the completed spreadsheet was delivered, the client claimed that it was like a mountain was lifted from {F0.her}{M0.his} shoulders. What could {F0.she}{M0.he} possibly be doing that {F0.her}{M0.his} life would be so affected by a spreadsheet? The client gave {0.SimFirstName} a bonus as special thanks for how fast the job was completed.
The client was devastated that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to finish the work on time, but still gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a portion of the pay out of politeness. Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} also needs to take a good look at {F0.herself}{M0.himself}.
The small business owner was amazed, but very confused at the door now open to {F0.him}{M0.her}. No more stacks of boxes full of inventory forms, no more digging for reference numbers. Now if only {F0.he}{M0.she} would stop breaking the formulas and accidentally coloring in cells...
The small business owner was so amazed at the efficiency and organization offered to {F0.him}{M0.her}, it was like a whole new world was now open. Given how fast the job was done, the owner is now convinced that computers are the way of the future. {F0.He}{M0.She} even sent {0.SimFirstName} a care package of their best products, whatever they are.
It seems {0.SimFirstName} also doesn't know how spreadsheets work. Either that, or {F0.she}{M0.he} underestimated the amount of work. Either way, the small business owner was pretty upset. It's a good thing they don't know how to file a formal complaint, so {0.SimFirstName} still received a small amount of pay.
In addition to delivering a compelling indie film poster, {0.SimFirstName} took the time to make up some nonsense about the symbolism of the imagery that {M0.he}{F0.she} included. Predictably, the film's director was enraptured by the care {0.SimFirstName} appeared to have taken to represent the film's vision. Another satisfied client!
{0.SimFirstName}'s indie film poster immediately resonated with movie goers looking to attend the Del Sol Valley Film Fest, as they started clamoring for copies of the poster to be made available for purchase. Recognizing the added revenue that {0.SimFirstName}'s work will bring in, the film's producer authorized a bonus payment to be deposited directly in {0.SimFirstName}'s bank account.
{0.SimFirstName} missed {M0.his}{F0.her} deadline for completing work on the indie film's poster, forcing the director to turn to a marketing agency to have a poster finished in time for the Del Sol Valley Film Fest. An angry voicemail left on {0.SimFirstName}'s phone had the director screaming how {0.SimFirstName} would never find work in this town again, but honestly {M0.she}{F0.he} seems like a bit of a blowhard...
The band is digging {0.SimFirstName}'s work! The concert poster looks, in their words, &quot;sick&quot;. The lead singer let {M0.him}{F0.her} know that there are some extra tickets to the show waiting for him in the will call booth.
The band LOVES {0.SimFirstName}'s work; ticket sales for the concert are already trending upwards and pointing towards a swift sellout. Not only did they include a bonus payment, they've invited {0.SimFirstName} to come chill on the tour bus before the show!
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the concert venue poster tasks in time to receive a full payment. A voice mail left on {M0.his}{F0.her} phone said everything {M0.he}{F0.she} needed to know about how the band felt... {M0.He}{F0.She} heard something along the lines of, &quot;loser square art nerd&quot; before {M0.he}{F0.she} just hung up.
{0.SimFirstName}'s loading screen art is a success! The game's beta testers are transfixed by the gorgeous on-screen art, and no longer seem to mind the loading they're enduring each time they play. Oddly enough, the top request after {0.SimFirstName}'s art was patched in was for the addition of a loading screen progress bar, so players knew how long they had to enjoy the imagery before being returned to the game.
In a sardonic text message, the game's producer told {0.SimFirstName}, &lt;i&gt;&quot;I've got over 99,999 problems, but loading screens aren't one.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; {0.SimFirstName} smiled, having been accepted into the inner circle of the development team as someone trustworthy for them to commiserate with. As a sign of thanks, the producer made a small gesture and named a character in the game after {0.SimFirstName}, as well as awarding {0.SimPronounObjective} with a small bonus payment for {M0.his}{F0.her} outstanding work.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete all of his tasks on time; it looks like the video game will ship with bland loading screens after all. Something as simple as a loading screen can't be enough to affect the game's review scores though... right? Well, whatever -- {0.SimFirstName} will be on to {M0.his}{F0.her} next gig long before then.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forensic sketch work showed a lot of promise. Within an hour of {M0.his}{F0.her} composite sketch being posted to the most wanted database, the police department received multiple tips to follow up on. Fingers crossed that it'll lead to getting more bad guys off the streets.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forensic sketch work led to the direct capture of the head of an organized crime ring within an hour of it being posted to the most wanted list! The police department was so thrilled, that they even let {M0.him}{F0.her} redline a police cruiser with the siren blaring. What a day!
The police department paid {0.SimFirstName} a prorated rate for {M0.his}{F0.her} time, but were disappointed that {M0.he}{F0.she} was unable to complete the job by their deadline.
{0.SimFirstName}'s time spent with the poet went well enough. {M0.He}{F0.She} may not exactly &quot;get&quot; slam poetry, but as long as the client's money is good, {0.SimFirstName} is happy to keep sketching along to {M0.her}{F0.his} verbal fever dreams.
{0.SimFirstName}'s time spent with the poet for an impromptu jam session was absolutely sublime. Words flowed seamlessly from {M0.her}{F0.his} mouth and onto {0.SimFirstName}'s sketch pad. {0.SimFirstName} even earned some bonus cash during their session from passersby who mistook their act as a street performance.
The poet that hired {0.SimFirstName} was upset that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks on time to be able to accompany {M0.her}{F0.him} to the slam poetry session. {M0.She}{F0.He} had an emotional breakdown when realizing {M0.she}{F0.he} still had to pay for the portion of work {0.SimFirstName} did manage to complete, which was followed by a promise to use {M0.her}{F0.his} time on stage to slam {0.SimFirstName} with an excoriating takedown.
The court was pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s skills, and immediately put {0.SimPronounObjective} to work documenting a significant case. It turns out that the job came with the additional perk of having {M0.his}{F0.her} name removed from the jury duty pool; not bad!
The judge was so pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s work, that {M0.she}{F0.he} allowed {0.SimFirstName} to act as an honorary bailiff and announce {M0.her}{F0.his} entrance to courtroom. What a thrill! The bonus pay was certainly a nice reward as well.
{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the gig's goals in time, and is lucky that the courthouse judge didn't declare {M0.him}{F0.her} as being in contempt of court. Thankfully, {M0.he}{F0.she} still received a partial payment; but don't be surprised if {M0.he's}{F0.she's} &quot;randomly&quot; selected for jury duty soon.
The collaboration between the client and {0.SimFirstName} end with a fantastic dive into the future. While the client’s initial idea wasn’t as unique as they hoped, the resulting work of fiction will definitely inspire other writers and scientist to dream of what could be just as other sci-fi stories have done before.
“Bestseller”, that’s all the client kept repeating as {0.SimFirstName} finished their last meeting before the deadline. Nearly every publishing company was chomping at the bits to be the novel’s sole printer.  The client even wrote the entire foreword of the book thanking {0.SimPronounObjective} and noting their contributions to the tale. {0.SimFirstName} wasn’t at all shocked when {F0.she}{M0.he} saw the clients payment for {F0.her}{M0.his} work was much higher than the original agreed amount.
With the client still stuck on a few details of the world and publisher interest waning on the incomplete story, the client scrapped the idea believing they wouldn’t be able to finish the novel. Though {0.SimFirstName} got paid for the work {M0.he}{F0.she} provided, {F0.she}{M0.he} felt like they could have done more to help solidify the idea in the clients head and make something groundbreaking.

In the Edit Relationships panel, you can set the relationships for each household member to the current Sim.\n&#xD;&#xA;Click on the drop down next to the Sim portrait to choose their relationship to that Sim.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you are done making edits, click the Checkmark to close the panel.

Bohemian's Formal Wear
It's unfair to ask Bohemians to conform to mainstream society's ideals or fashion, but that doesn't mean we can’t befriend them or include them in our lives! This untucked vest should make them feel nice and comfortable because Bohemians feel naked without their vests.

Barista
Fry Cook
Everyone has to start somewhere, and this won’t be so bad. I mean sure, {0.SimFirstName} will come home smelling like fried…something…and {M0.his}{F0.her} hands will reek of mildewed rags, but at least {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll}  get to see {M0.his}{F0.her} friends! Sort of. While {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} wearing a paper hat.
Table Cleaner
Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} has ascended the barista ranks and seized control of the frother. Now in charge of crafting sumptuous espresso drinks, adorned with a dollop of feather-light froth which {M0.he}{F0.she} arranges in cute patterns, {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she}’s a true artiste.
Latte Artiste
At last, {0.SimFirstName} can drop the dishrags and become one with the art of fine coffee! Grinding together the finest organic beans from around the globe, {0.SimFirstName} is now a master bean blender, a true mixologist whose arresting combinations of aggressively bold aromas and subtly nutty undertones please every palate.
Bean Blender
This is {0.SimFirstName}’s first step into the exciting world of caffeine distribution systems. But of course {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t be responsible for pouring coffee until {M0.he}{F0.she} proves {M0.he}{F0.she} can handle mopping floors, setting up chairs, scrubbing mugs and keeping those frothers and foamers shiny!
Coffee Stain Remover
{0.SimFirstName} has earned back {M0.his}{F0.her} weekend nights by securing a job at Holding Hands Daycare. Working with a loving, experienced team of childcare professionals, {0.SimFirstName} will help provide a gentle, caring and stimulating environment that honors the genius in every child.
Daycare Assistant
At last, {0.SimFirstName} has landed a steady nanny job with a nearby family. No more searching or scheduling-just one family with one sweet kid, who {M0.he}{F0.she} only has to win over once. {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t remember signing up for cleaning, toilet scrubbing, or laundry, but as the mother said, since {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} there and getting paid…
Nanny
{0.SimFirstName} can’t wait to finally earn some dough-and what could be more fun than getting paid to play with kids? Besides, the kids are asleep half the time, right? So it’s basically getting paid to couch-sit and text all {M0.his}{F0.her} friends. Cake!
Baby Sitter
Whiz kid. Wonder. Visionary. {0.SimFirstName} has been called them all, and {M0.he}{F0.she} is confident {M0.he}{F0.she} deserves it. Everything {M0.he}{F0.she} touches turns to gold. Doors open when {M0.he}{F0.she} so much as glances at them. And technologies only emerge with {M0.his}{F0.her} permission.
Start-up Genius
With an impressive track record for successfully launching companies, {0.SimFirstName} is always on the go and never off the grid, making split-second decisions by text on everything from development to creative to UI. Remarkably, people listen!
Dot-Com Pioneer
{0.SimFirstName} is making a name for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} in the tech world, but the cash from selling off {M0.his}{F0.her} first company is already getting thin. Instead of bowing to someone else’s vision, {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to earn money as a consultant for private investors.
Independent Consultant
At last, {0.SimFirstName} has ditched big company bureaucracy to launch {M0.his}{F0.her} very own company, founded on {M0.his}{F0.her} very own ideals, to build {M0.his}{F0.her} very own innovative solution. The only hitch? {M0.His}{F0.Her} very own money is not quite enough to get this thing off the ground.
The Next Big Thing?
{0.SimFirstName}’s got real power now. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t just manage measly one-off projects, {M0.he}{F0.she} is in charge of the development process for several groundbreaking products. Aye, aye, this is going to be fun!
Development Captain
{0.SimFirstName} has finally achieved the glory of middle management! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets to drive the schedule, squeeze hundreds of programming hours out of each week, work magic with budgets and play the {M0.jerk}{F0.ice queen} everyone else gets to whine about.
Project Manager
Wielding a rare combination of technical and political skills, {0.SimFirstName} is carving {M0.his}{F0.her} way up the ranks at last! While innovative work is still a faint glimmer on the horizon, it’s finally in view, and not everything {0.SimFirstName} does is totally mind-numbing.
Ace Engineer
Congrats to {0.SimFirstName}! Now, instead of risking life, limb, and job pointing out the gaping holes in someone else’s code, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to put all semblance of a life aside to program code based on someone else’s deadlines. At least there’s a benefits package!
Code Monkey
{0.SimFirstName} has entered the exciting world of QA, the unsung heroes of software development. It’s the perfect job for people who feel like they break everything they touch! But hey, better they break it than the customer, right? Right??
Quality Assurance
Welcome to Babysitting 101! {0.SimFirstName} will be using {M0.his}{F0.her} above-average intelligence for hours of gentle guidance and virtual handholding, exploring brave new limits on just how thinly one can veil sarcasm.
Live Chat Support Agent
WOOT! {0.SimFirstName} is now rolling in dough, and {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t have too many complaints about being famous either. Sponsors are picking up tabs left and right, there are Simoleons to be made by streaming {M0.his}{F0.her} practice sessions, and the tournament prizes are nothing to sneeze at. This is the dream of gamers everywhere!
Champion Gamer
With practice comes speed, and {0.SimFirstName}’s real-time strategy skills are living proof. With APM climbing past the 400 mark, {0.SimFirstName} has been known to assemble an army, equip it, construct an impenetrable base and annihilate at least one other race in the time it takes most people to tie their shoes.
APM {F0.Queen}{M0.King}
Fantasy, meet reality. {0.SimFirstName} is actually making a living playing games competitively. Sure, {M0.he}{F0.she} isn’t exactly pulling in six figures yet, but the bounty’s getting bigger, and the sponsors are taking note. Time to invest in media training!
Pro Gamer
As an amateur cyberathlete, {0.SimFirstName}’s world is about to change. After a lifetime of training within the dimly lit confines of bedrooms and basements, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to travel the world and go head-to-head in dimly lit indoor stadiums. {M0.His}{F0.Her} time is now.
eSports Competitor
After serving Good, then Evil, {0.SimFirstName} has decided to return to the Good side, to help crime-fighters get into the minds of the truly deranged. But is {M0.he}{F0.she} really helping, or leading them into a trap? Can {M0.his}{F0.her} true allegiance ever be known...?
Triple Agent
As a villain, {0.SimFirstName} is pretty super! You might even say {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} a...&quot;Supreme&quot; Villain. But that doesn’t mean every day is just stroking hairless cats and coining catchphrases. There’s a surprising amount of paperwork involved! Paperwork and torture. Some days it’s more paperwork, some days it’s more torture. Just depends.
Supreme Villain
Working for [redacted], {0.SimFirstName} does a lot of [redacted] and [redacted]. Sometimes {M0.he}{F0.she} has to [redacted], but [redacted]. Soon {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} [redacted] his medication for poison [redacted] before [redacted] spinning class and [redacted] steel drums. 
[Redacted]
After hitting a ceiling with the Good Guys, {0.SimFirstName}’s trying {M0.his}{F0.her} hand at some Evil. Hey, that’s where the real money is! If it works out, {M0.he}{F0.she} may switch over to Evil full time....
Double Agent
In the world of a spy, every stranger is a potential assassin. Every situation is a potential ambush. Fueled with adrenaline, {0.SimFirstName} lives fast and lives dangerously. {M0.He}{F0.She} also wears a lot of cool disguises. 
Secret Agent
{0.SimFirstName} feels a deep sense of patriotism serving the greater good. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} protecting {M0.his}{F0.her} countrymen from harm, performing a vital public service. Once these feelings wear off, {M0.he}{F0.she} can head back into the private sector and actually make some money.   
Government Agent
Running major cases is just like running any mid-size organization. It’s all about managing personnel, budgets, and the bottom line. The big difference is that if {0.SimFirstName} fails, the world blows up.  Other than that, it’s pretty much the same.  
Lead Detective
According to movies, as a field agent {0.SimFirstName} should immediately expect to go undercover to infiltrate a religious cult, street racing ring, or beauty pageant. Until then {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} be interviewing a lot of tinfoil hat-wearers about the radio transmitters implanted in their teeth. Allegedly. 
Field Agent
Run. Duck. JUDO CHOP THAT BAD GUY RIGHT NOW. {0.SimFirstName} loves giving orders. {M0.His}{F0.Her} agents will feel safe in {M0.his}{F0.her} capable hands, and {M0.he}{F0.she} can feel fulfilled being able to live {M0.his}{F0.her} spy fantasies vicariously through their adventures.  
Agent Handler
 Friendly Interactions ({0.String})
{M0.His}{F0.Her} security clearance is pretty low, but {0.SimFirstName}'s still learning some cool secrets. Since {0.SimFirstName}'s been analyzing intelligence, {0.SimFirstName}'s learned the real speed limit, a code word that allows {0.SimPronounObjective} to use any employees-only restroom, and the truth about the moon landing in the 30’s. 
Intelligence Researcher
Before {0.SimFirstName} can conduct international espionage and eliminate targets, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got to process some expense reports. And answer some phones. The occasional bagel run.... Exciting stuff!
Agency Clerk
Besides getting to wear a ton of incredible formalwear and sip drinks with perilously attractive strangers, {0.SimFirstName} also gets to gamble at foreign casinos with agency money. Being an international superspy is exactly as amazing as it sounds.
Double Diamond Agent
The day that {0.SimFirstName} made Shadow Agent, they took away {M0.his}{F0.her} thumbprints and driver’s license. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} a ghost, a specter, a silent entity slipping through motion-detecting security systems and floating through embassies. And sometimes doing a little light paperwork.
Shadow Agent
These young agents today, they don’t even understand how tough it was in the old days. Why, when {0.SimFirstName} assassinated {M0.his}{F0.her} first target, {M0.he}{F0.she} had to bury the body {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. With {M0.his}{F0.her} hands! Kids today, they’ve got it too easy. 
Spy Captain
{0.SimFirstName} has boldly painted {M0.his}{F0.her} way into a career in studio art—mastering still life, figure study, interior space, and the fine art of disdain for anyone living in mainstream society.
Imaginative Imagist
{0.SimFirstName} has landed a spot in an elite local painter's group, and {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio is growing quite large! Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should try building {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio with photographs instead of the original paintings....
Canvas Creator
{0.SimFirstName} is now a working artist! At least {M0.he}{F0.she}'s working a booth at a local art fair, where patrons are haggling down the price of {M0.his}{F0.her} watercolored landscapes. But the words &quot;work&quot; and &quot;artist&quot; are coming closer together. And that's a good sign!
Watercolor Dabbler
Being a hungry artist isn't about literal hunger. It's about {0.SimFirstName}'s burning passion to create an artistic expression that can change people's lives! (It's also about literal hunger.)
Hungry Artist
Saving up for art school supplies means working at the art school library. Unfortunately, the books must be re-shelved by number, and no one sees the genius in {0.SimFirstName} re-shelving them by complementary color. Visionaries are often misunderstood.
Art Book Collator
To create great art, one must suffer. {0.SimFirstName} is well on {M0.his}{F0.her} way to greatness, as {M0.he}{F0.she} will be asked to create floor-based installations using a water-based medium (i.e. mopping the floor).
Palette Cleaner
{0.SimFirstName}'s private collection has gained such widespread fame that {M0.he}{F0.she} now spends {M0.his}{F0.her} days negotiating with museums that want to display it. As long as they each build the &quot;{0.SimFirstName} Wing&quot;, with a bronze plaque of {0.SimFirstName}'s face, no problem!
Patron of the Arts
With a reputation like {0.SimFirstName}'s it's no wonder the museum would settle for no one else to curate their contemporary art collection. {0.SimFirstName} is a scholar and a master of unconventional work. That neon-boxer-shorts-displayed-in-a-bouncy-castle exhibit? Genius!
Composition Curator
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but money is in the eye of the appraiser. {0.SimFirstName} draws on {M0.his}{F0.her} significant training to determine the value of fine art, letting others know that not every paint-covered canvas is created equal.
Fine-Art Aficionado
{0.SimFirstName} now spends equal amounts of time improving {M0.his}{F0.her} own technique and politely suggesting how other artists can improve theirs. It allows interaction with the greatest talents of this generation, even if those interactions are sometimes prickly.
Color Theory Critic
Students now flock to {0.SimFirstName}, hoping to glean even a bit of the technique that has made {M0.his}{F0.her} artwork so popular. Time to pass on what {M0.he}{F0.she} has learned to the next generation, or just wave {M0.his}{F0.her} paintbrush and sigh, &quot;Hopeless!&quot;
Master of the Real
Professional illustrator is a challenging role. {0.SimFirstName} controls the final visual, but does not control the subject matter. Whether it's a famous historical figure or a cartoon squirrel, {M0.he}{F0.she} is up to the task! 
Illustrious Illustrator
{0.SimFirstName} just hung some work in the hottest gallery in town! And it's actually {M0.his}{F0.her} work this time! This is a wonderful achievement for any artist.
Professional Painter
Winning this artist residency is a true honor! Not everyone gets to work in an unheated barn loft for free. What a great way for {0.SimFirstName} to experience a slice of life {M0.he}{F0.she} would never actually choose! 
Artist en Residence
Okay, so... Not every child is going to get school right away. Don’t worry! Every student starts somewhere, and with a little effort {0.SimFirstName} will bring those grades up in no time. Even writing {M0.his}{F0.her} name on the test is worth a few points!  
We're a hot new Sillisim Valley startup, and we need to make a splash with an eye-grabbing professional logo before raising further capital in our Series B funding round. Look, don't get bogged down in the details... This is a simple job. And don't even think about asking to get paid in stock grants (fat chance we'll give an artist equity before our eventual record smashing IPO.) You give us a hot logo; we give you Simoleons.
Icons for Sims Forever
Things have been going exceptionally well for The Sims Studio, having launched our title &quot;Sims Forever&quot; nearly 5 years ago. Fans of the game are clamoring for something new though, and we're getting to work on yet another expansion pack for the seminal title. Can you help take Sims Forever to the next level? We need to outsource icon art to someone who's proficient at visualizing moodlets, headlines, whims, traits, aspirations, and more with minimal guidance. Get in the game!

Are you the expert iconographist we've been searching for?

But if you're willing to roll up the sleeves on your smock-frock and get painting, then we've got a job for you.

Are you sure {0.SimFirstName} should quit {M0.his}{F0.her} position of {2.String}?

Bad news! {0.SimFirstName} was dismissed.

&lt;font color='#03ADEE'&gt;Holiday - {1.Number} {S1.day}{P1.days} earned. &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color='#03ADEE'&gt;Holiday&lt;/font&gt;
It appears as if {0.SimFirstName} is having problems with the alphabet. {M0.He}{F0.She} can't seem to get past 'A'! Kudos!
{0.SimFirstName} has returned from school. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s one of the top students at {3.String}. Keep up the good work!
Stellar! {0.SimFirstName} can surely enjoy the weekend knowing {M0.he}{F0.she}'s one of the top students at {3.String}. Perhaps {M0.he}{F0.she} could make some time for some extra-credit assignments, just in case.
There is no better feeling than starting the weekend as a straight-A student. {0.SimFirstName} should feel proud!
One sure hopes {0.SimFirstName}'s weekend plans include focusing on schoolwork. Receiving such low grades could affect {M0.his}{F0.her} future!
Receiving Ds in school is no laughing matter. {0.SimFirstName} should use the weekend to reflect and put some effort towards {M0.his}{F0.her} studies.
{0.SimFirstName} is done with school for the day. A 'B' is not a bad grade, but that doesn't mean there isn't any room for improvement.
School is out for the day. {3.String} is filled with 'B' students. {0.SimFirstName} is one of them. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could try to distinguish {M0.him}{F0.her}self more?
School's over, and {0.SimFirstName} is not performing so well. As a matter of fact, {M0.he}{F0.she} is performing quite poorly.
{0.SimFirstName} is back from school for the day and {M0.his}{F0.her} report card is riddled with D's. That is surely unpleasant for everyone.
{0.SimFirstName} is done with school for the day. {M0.He}{F0.She} is doing satisfactory work, but {M0.his}{F0.her} teachers at {3.String} think {M0.he}{F0.she} could easily improve with just a little bit of extra effort.
{0.SimFirstName} is back home from school. No need to make room on the refrigerator door... {M0.His}{F0.Her} work is merely satisfactory.
{0.SimFirstName} is back from school. Friday nights are great for turning Bs into As. {M0.He}{F0.She} could focus on that, perhaps.
{0.SimFirstName} is done with school for the week. {M0.He}{F0.She} is doing well, but it wouldn't hurt to go the extra mile. Perhaps the weekend would be a good time to do so.
It's the weekend. {0.SimFirstName} wraps up this week with a 'C' in school. Is that really satisfactory?
{0.SimFirstName} is not the first 'C' student at {3.String}, and {M0.he}{F0.she} surely won't be the last. Wouldn't the weekend be a great time for {0.SimPronounObjective} to bump {M0.his}{F0.her} grades up?
{0.SimFirstName} is failing! {M0.He}{F0.She} needs to take action and turn those grades around if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to have a bright future.
Fs! {0.SimFirstName} is performing extremely disappointingly at school. {M0.He}{F0.She} better shape up soon!
{0.SimFirstName} is failing! {M0.He}{F0.She} should use the weekend to focus on homework. This way, {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll have a shot at not being featured in {3.String}'s infamous Hall of Dropouts.
Another school week is over and {0.SimFirstName} has established {M0.him}{F0.her}self as one of {3.String}'s lowest-ranking students. What a shame!

{0.SimFirstName}'s spouse was flirting with another. Have they been doing this behind {M0.his}{F0.her} back?
Flirty Engaged Partner
{0.SimFirstName}'s engaged partner was flirting with another Sim. What's been going on behind {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} back?
Even More Awkward
(HIDDEN) It takes a lot to satisfy a foodie, and that meal didn't quite cut it
Pretty Tasty
That was a fairly tasty dish.
Bland Food
That meal was a very unfulfilling experience.
Edible
That food wasn't what I'd call good.  But it wasn't terrible either.
Terrible Food
That food was worse than unpalatable; it was atrocious!
Bad Aftertaste
That food wasn't very tasty...
Clever Fingers
FINALLY figured this out! Sims won't go hungry because of their eating utensil.
Butter Fingers
Just...can't...seem...to figure...these things...out.
Bursting with Life!
That Ambrosia was full of rejuvenating energies!
Focused by Potion
Incredible! Drinking that potion focuses the mind like nothing else!
Flirty by Potion
Whew! That potion really makes a Sim feel flirty!
Musical Dedication
Someone promised to dedicate a song to this Sim. How romantic!
First Kiss!
Swirling with feelings of passion and happiness after a first kiss with someone new!
Fireproof!
As long as {0.SimFirstName} is wearing the Firefighter suit, {M0.he}{F0.she} has a better chance at withstanding the effects of fire and will be better at successfully extinguishing fires.
Fire!
Fire! Sims must extinguish fires or flee them.
Singed!
Covered head-to-toe in soot. Better wash this stuff off.&#xD;&#xA;
I'm On Fire!
Oh no! This Sim needs to be extinguished...and quick!
(From Previously Being on Fire)
Fire Is Out!
Thank goodness the fire is over. Could it have been any worse? 
Life Saver!
Saving another Sim's life brings on a surge of confidence!
Fire Fighter!
Bravely extinguishing a blaze really boosts a Sim's confidence!
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t feeling too good after watching {M0.his}{F0.her} friend lose that fight.
Witnessing a fight is weighing heavily on {0.SimFirstName}'s mind. There are better ways to solve arguments!
Why must others fight to solve an issue? {0.SimFirstName} isn't too happy they had to watch a fight unfold.
Watching an argument turn to blows has given {0.SimFirstName} several great idea. Now, if they only knew what exactly caused the fight.
Fight Witnessed
{0.SimFirstName} is glad that {M0.his}{F0.her} friend won the fight!
After witnessing a fight, {0.SimFirstName} is ready for a fight themselves!
{0.SimFirstName} was excited to see a brawl, but it was so one sided they immediate lost interest
No More Water
{0.SimFirstName} may not know many chemicals, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does know the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide. {M0.He}{F0.She} might have enjoyed water before but {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn't even want to think of water or those letters anymore.
Paranoid From Magic
Experiencing ill-intended magic has {0.SimFirstName} on edge. Just the hint of a sparkle makes {0.SimPronounObjective} think about running and hiding.
Did That Move?
Maybe it was just the wind? It couldn't possibly be ANOTHER ghost, could it?
It's Baaaaack
{0.SimFirstName} thought ghosts were just a one-time thing but that only seemed to be the beginning.
Looming Dread
That dreadful feeling looms over {0.SimFirstName} as {M0.he}{F0.she} discovers something new about {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. A fear that wasn't there before, growing inside. Ready to overcome {0.SimFirstName} into paralysis at any moment.
Looming Anxiety
That anxious feeling looms over {0.SimFirstName} as {M0.he}{F0.she} discovers something new about {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. A fear that wasn't there before, growing inside, ready to overcome {0.SimFirstName} into paralysis at any moment.
{0.SimFirstName} is afraid of fire!
Knew They Wouldn't Like it
It was silly to think that what {0.SimFirstName} made had any value to begin with.
Which Failure Awaits Today?
At this point {0.SimFirstName} thought {M0.he}{F0.she} would be used to failing at everything but every day is a new surprise in disappointment.
Never Good Enough
Not surprising that anything {0.SimFirstName} does results in failure, even the things that {M0.he}{F0.she} makes.
Recognized
All of {0.SimFirstName}'s hard work has been recognized.
Still a Failure
Even when asked how much of a failure {0.SimFirstName} is, it isn't any easier to hear.
{0.SimFirstName} fears Death too much to plead with the Grim Reaper doing work.
Fear the Reaper!
Is that the reaper? Why is the reaper getting closer?
Small Existential Relief
Sometimes it helps to think of death as just the beginning of something new. What that new is will be up to {0.SimFirstName} to decide.
Passionless Job
What's the point anymore? Get to work, mindlessly do job, get paycheck, sleep, repeat. What is {0.SimFirstName} even doing here?
Nothing Good From This Job
No angle, different way of thinking, dream, imagination, or scenario has convinced {0.SimFirstName} that this job is worth sticking around for. Perhaps it's just time to move on...
New Challenges
With a little shift of the mindset, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to go to work with head held high and passion to tackle whatever life brings.
What Was That Noise?
Groggy thinking can cause shadows to look like leprechauns trying to steal lunch money in the bathroom.
Afraid of the Dark
In the vast nothingness of the darkness, the night holds mystery, intrigue, and fear.
Need to Escape
Are the walls closing in? It's getting a bit harder to breathe. Was open air always that far away? No time for pleasantries or jokes, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to leave. Now!
{0.SimFirstName} can't fathom being {M0.himself}{F0.herself} while being so stressed out around others.
Too Many Sims
Things are starting to get a little claustrophobic here. {0.SimFirstName} can only focus on mind over matter for so long before {M0.he}{F0.she} will want to leave to somewhere less crowded.
{0.SimFirstName} is too afraid of plants
Fear the Great Cowplant
No matter where {0.SimFirstName} looks, the Cowplant is always there. Its saliva burned into the frightening memory of the encounter. That piece of cake just wasn't worth it.
(From Being Afraid of Cowplants)
Fear Conquered!
Breathing a sigh of relief, {0.SimFirstName} has overcome {M0.his}{F0.her} fear. It feels like nothing can bring {0.SimPronounObjective} down!
One Step at a Time
{0.SimFirstName} has done the first step towards confronting {M0.his}{F0.her} fears, but it will take a little more work to be fully ready to conquer them.
Judging Eyes
It's as if everyone can tell {0.SimFirstName}'s whole life with their gaze. The words might remain unspoken, but {0.SimFirstName} knows everyone is hanging on {M0.his}{F0.her} every word. And not in a good way.
Judging Me Softly
Something feels off. The quick glances away, the silent smirks, the quiet chuckles. No matter where {0.SimFirstName} looks, it feels like everyone else is judging {M0.him}{F0.her} back.
Sorting Out Problems
Sometimes all it takes is a little open communication to discover why a Sim might not appreciate another Sim's company.
Judged
It takes a lot to open up to another Sim and find out what their differences are. That doesn't make it any easier to be rejected.
Growing Stronger Together
It takes time, but discussing issues and problems before they become too big has helped {0.SimFirstName} strengthen their relationship.
Blind Accusations
Trust and communication are key to any relationship but those could easily be shattered by someone throwing around blind accusations.
Something a Cheater Would Say!
It's easy to blow someone off with empty dismissals, but {0.SimFirstName} knows the truth... or maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} just fears the truth and is trying so hard to make it true.
Are They Better?
What do they all have that {0.SimFirstName} doesn't? Is {M0.he}{F0.she} lacking something in their relationship?
Always Time for Them
Gentle signs of affection might not seem much to the untrained eye, but {0.SimFirstName} can't help but focus on all of the affection given out to other Sims and not {M0.him}{F0.her}.
I Knew It!
All of that worrying has come true. Now what?
No More Pesky Burglars!
What was that?! Who's there?! Is the burglar here AGAIN?!
Appreciates Portrait
Some portraits just give that warm and fuzzy feeling.
Day of the Dead Celebrant!
{0.SimFirstName} has got a bone to pick with the Grim Reaper...\n\n...Just kidding; they'll probably be best buds if he shows up! Perhaps they'll enthuse over each other's sugar skull collections?\n\nAs long as {0.SimFirstName} is a celebrant, {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} have a high chance to successfully plead with the Grim Reaper for another Sim's life, and can quickly gain relationship with the Grim Reaper.
(From Giving a Book to the Littlest Neighborhood Library)
You get a book, and you get a book!
{0.SimFirstName} loves that books can now be available to everyone! Maybe {0.SimPronounSubjective} should check for something new or donate an old favorite book!
Prolific Persona
People are starting to take notice. All of that time tirelessly chasing your dream is finally paying off, figuratively and literally. 
Modeling Looks
You do your little turn on the catwalk. Ya. On the Catwalk.
Style Impression
All great works start off as fleeting ideas that inspire refinement. Capture this impression on a Style-board to refine it into fashion fabulousness!
Fashion Fanatic
Being &quot;crazy about clothing&quot; is one thing. Going crazy from clothing is quite another.
Fake News
When did facts become subjective?!
Rejected Write-Up
A recently submitted news-story was declined by the hacks in editorial who wouldn’t know good writing if it jumped off the page, without a care in the world and lived happily ever after. 
Bombed It
Gross-out jokes aren't funny when they bomb.
Spy Swagger
Some agents can't help being great at creating a distraction....
Sponsor Pride
It feels great to give a new young talent a boost!
Sponsor Disappointment
Too bad the artist had plenty of talent but not enough scruples.
Speaker Power
It's a journalist's job to tell the truth, no matter how shocking.

Aliens can enjoy comedy, too. Their laughs may sound like bubbling and their applause like tiny explosions, but a good performance is a good performance.
Inked by Space Squid
There is no bright side of being squirted with space squid ink.
Got Duped
A bird in the hand is definitely better than none in the bush.

Stressful School Day
It doesn't matter how much you study, a hard test is always stressful.
Bummer School Day
Ever had one of those days at school where you just felt like you needed a hug?
Funny School Day
The funniest thing happened at school today. No, it was not class related.
Enlightening School Day
It's like things finally clicked today. Better make sure {0.SimFirstName} does {M0.his}{F0.her} homework before it un-clicks!
Satisfying School Day
You aced the pop quiz, won on the playground, and dropped an epic joke during math class. Just an all around solid day at school!
Productive School Day
Feels so good to get stuff done! Now's the time to own that homework!
Flirtatious School Day
Got a compliment from a cute classmate. Pretty good day!

Killer School Day

Boring School Day
Class today just dragged on and on and on...
Annoying School Day
Ugh! Teachers can be so annoying sometimes...
Stressed from School
Too much studying at school can make any kid a little tense!
Good Grades
Succeeding in school makes young Sims particularly happy!

A bit of handiness with power tools never hurts.
Drill Failure
The drill failed and as a result, there was no way to bust through to complete the heist.
Obtained Codes
A feather can be a great weapon.
Rethinking Options
It may be time to think about career alternatives.
Respected Gamer
Staying ethical in any game is a winning move.
Rejected &amp; Replaced
It would seem that it's true that everyone's a critic. 
Regrettable Inaction
It's never a good feeling second-guessing decisions you've made.
Really Bugged
Fixing so many bugs is a good career move, but does come with some stress.
Crime shouldn't have to be environmentally friendly.
Performed for Friends
Practice Makes Perfect
It may take a while, but keeping at it is worth it.
Poor Performance
Seems as though distractions are getting in the way of education.
Political Truthsayer
Journalistic truth triumphs over political dishonesty every time.
Political Pariah
Trying to take down a dirty politician is risky business.
Pickpocket Successful
Subtlety is the name of the game.
Persuasive
The power of persuasion can sometimes get everyone what they need.
Teased by Rangers
There's nothing worse than being laughed at by all your Co-workers.

Sometimes, even Glorzaks deserve the benefit of the doubt.
Inspired by Reference
Taking inspiration from some reference, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to paint.
Nothing There
A sense of frustration from searching for something inspiring and finding nothing.

Out of Practice

Art in the Dark
It wouldn't be so bad if docents handed out flashlights to patrons....
Enjoyable Vacation
Relaxing is good for the health, so maybe it's not completely a lie.
Grunt of Shame
Guess the power grunt just isn't for everyone. You can't force these things.
Drew a Crowd
Sometimes getting attention requires some unorthodox methods.
Dispersed the Crowd
Dressing in a silly costume just wasn't worth it after all.
Grunt of Triumph
Who knew that making noise was the key to lifting an extra 30 pounds?
Feels good to make people dance to the music!
Tasty Secrets
What is that in the ink? A hint of cinnamon? Cocoa, perhaps?
Taste of Failure
And whatever those guards were snacking on.
It's worth rewarding a job well done.
Got Spooked
Long Interview
That interview took a really long time.
Job Security
Art is not an objective pursuit--it needs a living, breathing Sim to understand its value.
Of all the jobs to be replaced by machines, who would have thought art critic would be one of them?
Being scared off that easily isn't the way to get ahead.
That was the dullest, least interesting answer ever.
Enjoyable Interview
That went very well!
Composition Ignored
No feedback feels worse than negative feedback.
Class Comedian
Laughter is the best medicine for everyone!
Bad Answer
Appealing Composition

Best class ever!
Truth or Dodgeball
Tarnished Reputation
Dishonest critics never get any respect.
Straight Arrow Partner
How quaint--an honest agent. That was close!

Quizaster
Passed the Blame
It never feels good to get someone else fired.
Helping the Cool Kids
This is a great way to get a quick leg up the popularity ladder!
Knotted Up
Flexibility is important and all, but no one wants to see a bodybuilder all tangled up in a pile of limbs.
Nailed It
{0.SimFirstName} is smart enough to know how important flexibility is to the well-rounded bodybuilder.
Fickle Bride
The Bride never asked for a classical playlist!
Appeased the Bride
No one wants a bride on the warpath on her wedding day.
Anything For Exposure
What's a little &quot;I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine&quot; among friends?
Guess that's the reward for doing a good deed.
Ungrateful Rival
Overdid It
That's what you get for doing deadlifts when it isn't leg day.
Having to aid  one's rival as a result of dirty tricks is shameful.
Tutoring Rival
Principal Poisoned
The principal isn't going to enjoy this brownie one bit.
Sticky Keys
It's hard being away from one's instrument for so long.
Spy Games
Isn't it fun to think about who would play you in a movie?
Shamed Bully
A little public humiliation is just the ticket.
It's true what they say--no good deed goes unpunished.
Rewarded Inspiration
Being rewarded for good work feels as good as giving credit where it's due.
It always pays to do the right thing.
Notebook Returned
There are worse nicknames than &quot;Frosty,&quot; right?
Memoirs Canceled
National security and tell-alls don't mix.
This job isn't always mayhem and danger. Sometimes, it's hilarious.
Maybe a couple of hours in the can will dissuade him from stealing anymore lunches.
Job Insecurity
Are purple extremities a good reason to see a doctor?
False Acclaim
It's not a good career move to steal ideas from students.
Critically Acclaimed
It feels great to receive acclaim for pushing boundaries.
Cleaned the Ivories
A bit of elbow grease saved a ton of Simoleons.
Laxative-Laced Brownie
Another Lost Meal
It was an admirable effort, but that meal couldn't be saved.
It feels good to sail ahead of the competition, regardless of how it happens.
Ahead of Rival
Unorthodox Report
Sometimes, the mundane just needs a little creative...tweaking.
That two percent points of failure will never stop stinging.
Total Perfection
Terminally Hot
Looking good does come with some benefits.
Over the Top
There's a reason this is called journalism and not creative writing.
Over Partied
Hopefully the party was worth being destroyed by the competition.
Every movement takes flight when it can articulate its mission.
Movement's Inspiration
The toll of test taking mounts in the form of additional stress and lower scores. Eek!
Lower SDT Score
Lacked Momentum
Without adherents, no artistic movement will ever get off its feet.
In the Gamer Zone
With enough focus, one can be unstoppable.
This score may not be perfect, but it's close enough!
Happy With Results
Feigned Illness
Don't feel like working? Feigning sickness is one option.
Failed Ruse
That did not work out as planned.
It's not flying that's hard. It's landing.
Indignant
Why would someone yell at {0.SimFirstName} for trying to help? WHY?
Fiery Ex
What a terrible service call! What an earful! 
Ex on Hold
Dealing with the ex now in tech support is just as silly as when dating. Click! Next call.
Empty Crowd
At least the crickets applauded.
Writing for TV
One step away from actually appearing on TV!
Lingering Soreness
Sometimes it doesn't pay to play through the pain...
Scammed
What a waste of money and time!

All is well! Fluffy has been found!
Sometimes a little help from friends can make all the difference.
Peer Study
New Recipe

Lost Pet-Handling Rights
Teacher frowns upon losing the class pet, oddly enough.
Haters Appeased
Listening to customer feedback pays off.
Fluffy Recovered
Everyone is relieved that Fluffy is back, safe and sound.
Fluffy Missing
Hopefully, Fluffy is somewhere safe. Wherever he is.
This felt like a last chance, and it turns out to be worthless.
Far Behind
At least a dull day at school is good for improving one's aim.
Spitball Marksman
Sent to Principal
Another trip to the principal can only mean one thing - it's another school day.
Quick Snack
A quick dose of sugary snacks brings the metabolism back in check for a day of study.
But that was such a great dream....
Asleep In Class
Another day, another trip to the principal's office.
Another Lecture
Shared Used Gum
There's always a taker for ABC gum--already been chewed.

This thing won't even make it off the ground.

Burglar!!!
There's a burglar about!
Heroic Efforts
{0.SimFirstName} won the fight against the burglar! That should make them think twice about coming back around here.
Wheeee!
The rush of sliding down the ladder is exhilarating!
Dealing with the end of a long term romance is cause for sadness. 
Broken Up
Aves Amusement
{0.SimFirstName} has yet to win a game of Bird Tag.
Bird Brain
{0.SimFirstName} sure showed those birds!
Beguiled
Those dreamy eyes have gotten this Sim into quite the flirty state!
Perfect Firmness
Like sleeping on a cloud, or that is what a cloud would totally feel like anyway.
Passed Out
Looks like that &quot;nap&quot; turned into a dazed slumber...
Revitalized by Nap

Extra Homework
You got in trouble for something in school and as a result were sentenced to death by homework. Lots and lots of homework!

If you think career advice is always welcome... better think again!
Expert Career Consultant
Sometimes a push in the right direction is all someone needs!
Amateur Career Consultant
When someone doesn't want to take the steps to achieve their dreams, what else can {0.SimFirstName} do?
Startled Amazement
What a stunt! Turns out archery is actually the coolest skill ever! Thankfully, that arrow went right through the apple and not anything else in the vicinity, {0.SimFirstName} especially.
Sharpshooter
That little stunt could've gone &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; wrong, but thankfully {0.SimFirstName} is the ultimate archery master! Well, {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.was}{P0.were} this time, at least...
(From Shooting Apple Stunt)
Close Call
This is what happens when Sims get delusions of archery grandeur! Never again. Things could've gone much worse.
Practice Makes Perfect
It really feels great to see the arrow hit its mark. Bullseyes are such a rush!
Torn Rotator
Was the pain from Archer's Elbow not enough?! For continuing to practice archery while injured, {0.SimFirstName} is now more seriously injured than before.
Archer's Elbow
Ouch! A bit too much archery has {0.SimFirstName} feeling a bit sore in the elbow. Maybe it's time to take a break and rest up?
Archery Master!
{0.SimFirstName} is going to be basking in that epic archery win for a while!
Off the Mark
Oof, perhaps {0.SimFirstName} should work on {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} Archery Skills before competing again. That wasn't exactly the best showing!
(From Archery)
Left Behind
{0.SimFirstName} can hardly believe an animal had to leave them due to lack of care. {F0.She}{M0.He} hopes to prevent it from ever happening again.

{0.SimFirstName} had a nightmare about a dog with limbs that stretched like a human. It was a horrible, horrible sight.
Nightmare!

Dear {0.SimName},\n\nI leave to you the sum of {1.Money} as a reminder of the hard work and dedication that your grandfather and I put into amassing our wealth. However, I have concerns that if I left too much to you and your siblings, it may only serve to encourage your reckless behavior. This small sum is meant to help you stay afloat, but it is also a reminder that you must take responsibility for your own success.\n\nI implore you to cherish your siblings and work together to establish a legacy of your own. Do not rely solely on the wealth that has been left to you, but use it wisely and in a way that benefits both yourself and your family. It is time to grow up and prove yourself as a responsible and productive member of society.\n\nWith cautious optimism for your future,\n\nGrandmother
The Last Will and Testament of the Family's Estate
Dear {0.SimName},\n\nIt is with great pleasure that I bequeath to you the sum of {1.Money}. Your grandfather and I worked tirelessly for many years to amass this wealth, and it gives me great comfort to know that it will be put to good use. Despite the occasional disagreements and moments of tension, I have witnessed your capacity for kindness, determination, and hard work. I am proud of the person you have become, {0.SimFirstName}, and I trust that you will use this money to continue to contribute positively to our family and society as a whole.\n\nWith love and best wishes,\n\nGrandmother

Hanging out feels more exciting when you have to sneak out to do it!
That party was a taste of what life will be like someday and a truly awesome memory to have when I'm old and boring.
Everyone was so much older and intimidating. I felt like a little kid the whole time. It was awful.
I don't think I'm ready for a college party. Way too many things to worry about and stress over!
That was my scene! Those were my people! I can't wait for that to be my life all the time!
First time sneaking out! Not sure if it's paranoia or adrenaline but I feel SUPER HUMAN.
Can't believe I got caught. I blame the creaky window pane.
A little trouble never hurt nobody and I'd say tonight was more than successful.
I'm heading out tonight. Can't remember if my parents lurk but if you do, you didn't see this. 
It's way easier to jump out of lockers than to wait around in damp old caves to jump out and scare passerbys.
Follower Update: Today your follower count changed by {0.Number}.
Bat they didn't see that one coming! No one expects a bat in their locker.
I'm the terror that flaps in the night! I am the dog that eats your homework!\nHiding in that locker was the perfect prank.
I did my best to hide my tears and muffle my cries in my locker. Everyone still noticed.
It's comforting crying into the door of my locker. The cries echo back to me and it feels like I'm less alone.

Your follower count and you are the same. A big 0.
Did it get hot in there, or was it just me? A fire alarm can really wake you up out of a steamy daydream.
A benefit of being fire prepared is that I got to miss out on class time and that pop quiz.
We are going to do terribly in a real fire! That evacuation was so slow. Only half the alarms worked.
Ugh, could that drill have taken any longer?! I have things to do! Act like there's a fire and MOVE IT!
Bring it on, Fire! We are ready for you now!\nAfter these fire drills we will definitely keep our cool.
My feet hurt and I'm still indecisive as ever. Just thinking about the future during Career Day is exhausting.
Got my future locked in! Trust your gut and pursue your dreams!
I'm not sure career day helped... How can anyone decide what to be?
After that Career Day I am beyond ready for my future! Come at me world!!
There's a bright future in front of me full of possibilities and I can't wait to dive in.
Violence on school grounds?!? Total anarchy! I can't be dodging bad grades AND fists.
{0.SimFirstName} U up?
I've got an idea. You, me, and a boba tea with two straws.
I'm thinking you would be a great pillow fight partner, {0.SimFirstName}. How about it?
Wanna go to the ice cream stand? I'd like a scoop of you.
Let me take you to Plumbite Pier. I've got a seat on the Cuddle Carts reserved just for you.
You know when cats swipe at each other but never make contact? That's what that fight was. So boring!
The soul of a coward rests in these bones, and it was proven by my utter lack of interference during that fight.
Welcome to the punch bowl, home of the punches! Utterly exhilarating to see a fight between foes!
I can smell the sweet air of freedom! And possibly the stench of afterschool activity sweat.
If you saw me in detention, no you didn't.
Do they make detention seats extra uncomfy or is it just the shame of being there that hurts?
Spent all of lunch with food in my teeth! Was no one going to tell me?!
Seeing someone with lunch in their teeth. How embarrassing!!!

Himalayan
These cats are sweet-tempered, intelligent, and generally very social and good companions. Because of their heritage from the Siamese cats, they tend to be more active than Persians.
Golden Retriever
The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Jill will change this and likely remove references to guns and things that they shoot.

Distinguished by their long beards and eyebrows, Standard Schnauzers are always pepper and salt or less commonly black in color, with a stiff and wiry hair coat on the body similar to that of other wirehaired breeds.
Chihuahua
How a Chihuahua turns out depends mightily on the genetic temperament of his parents and grandparents. Chihuahuas can be easily provoked to attack, and are therefore generally unsuitable for homes with small children. The breed tends to be fiercely loyal to one particular person and in some cases may become over protective of the person, especially around other people or animals.
Calico
Calico cats are domestic cats with a spotted or particolored coat that is predominantly white, with patches of two other colors.
Wire Fox Terrier
Two of the wire fox terrier's most distinctive traits are its energy and intelligence. It has a low threshold for boredom and requires stimulation, exercise and attention. The wire fox terrier is a companion animal that requires near-constant attention.
Welsh Springer Spaniel
The Welsh Springer Spaniel is active, loyal, and affectionate. They may meet strangers barking when in their territory, or act aloof, cautious or wary. The breed is well known for being friendly and demonstrative to all members of the family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, playful attitude.
LaPerm
The LaPerm is in many ways a cat of moderation with no extremes and is still true to its original type. It does however have an unusual coat.

The Field Spaniel can be a good family dog while it has a job to do. They are suitable for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief.
Persian
The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. In Britain, it is sometimes called the Longhair or Persian Longhair. It is also known as the Shirazi cat or Iranian cat, particularly in the Middle East. Jill will change this.

Curly Coated Retriever
The Curly Coated Retriever was originally developed as a gun dog and their temperament and conformation reflect this purpose. Curlies are still used in many countries as bird hunting companions, including in both upland and waterfowl hunting.
Afghan Hound
The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals.

The Irish Red and White setter can be the most devoted and affectionate of dogs making them ideal all-round family dogs. They are extremely intelligent and respond well to proper training but they do need to have plenty to occupy them.
Boston Terrier
The Boston Terrier is a gentle breed that typically has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humour. Bostons are generally eager to please their owner and can be easily trained.
Schnauzer
Schnauzer comes from the German word for &quot;snout&quot; and means colloquially &quot;moustache&quot;, because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout. Although the schnauzer is considered a terrier-type dog, they do not have the typical terrier temperament.
British Longhair
The British Longhair is a longer-haired development from the longstanding British Shorthair breed. In the mid-20th century, British Shorthairs were interbred with imported long-haired varieties with an aim to producing more stout and round-faced stock, while retaining the short coat
Black and Tan Coonhound
The Black and Tan Coonhound makes a suitable pet: it is mellow, amiable, calm, and unobtrusive indoors; outdoors, its strong hunting instinct takes over and it can be difficult to turn it from tracking after it starts trailing.
Old English Sheepdog
The breed standards describe the ideal Old English Sheepdog as never being nervous or aggressive. The Old English Sheepdog comes from the very old pastoral type dogs but no records were kept of the dogs, and everything about the earliest types is guesswork.

Brittany
The Brittany was originally bred as a hunting dog and noted for being easy to train and sweet-natured. The breed is generally more sensitive to correction than other hunters, and harsh corrections are often unnecessary.

Siamese are usually very affectionate and intelligent cats, renowned for their social nature. Many enjoy being with people and are sometimes described as &quot;extroverts&quot;. Often they bond strongly to a single person. Some Siamese are extremely vocal, with a loud, low-pitched voice—known as &quot;Meezer&quot;, from which they get one of their nicknames.

I'm exhausted. Going to move out now and go take a nap somewhere on a park bench. 
Looks like I'm finally getting some rest due to a proper bed arrangement. I'll stay here and get a nap.

Social
Sims are social creatures that need to interact with others. Invite over a friend, chat someone up on the computer or phone, or just stop a neighbor walking by on the street.
Hygiene
Even Sims need to freshen up from time to time. A quick shower or bath will keep the stink away.
Hunger
Like all living creatures, Sims need sustenance. Have a meal, order pizza, or grill something delicious.
Fun
Everyone needs some fun in their lives, even Sims. Find a TV, play some chess, or of course, play a video game!
Energy
Coffee can stave off the sandman for a while, but eventually all Sims need their zzz's.

{0.SimFirstName} is Imbalanced, which will probably manifest in some unfortunate way.
Balance &amp; Imbalance expresses how a Sim's Mood affects them over time, beyond moment-to-moment.\n\nSims that generally spend more time in negative Moods will move toward Imbalance, while positive Moods move back toward Balance. Some major life events can also change balance instantly!\n\nImbalance comes with various effects, such as impacted Needs or very high vulnerability to Ailments.

Beyond the emotional ups and downs each day brings, {0.SimFirstName} is Balanced.

Open Quirk Slot
Locked Quirk Slot 
\nThis quirk slot is locked until you've reached a higher Celebrity Level.
\nA celebrity's behavior determines what quirks they develop.
As a Sim increases their Celebrity Level, they drift further from normal life. At certain levels, Sims will gain new Quirk Slots, which can be filled with Quirks based on the behavior they engage in.\n\nOnce acquired, Quirks may be removed by using the Celestial Crystal Crown or drinking the Quirk-B-Gone reward potion. Removing a quirk will open up the slot, which may then get filled by a new quirk!\n\nThe Sim's current quirks may be seen under Earned Quirks, while all possible quirks can be seen under All Quirks.
Earned Quirks
All Quirks
This Sim's fame will be reset and they will no longer gain fame. Default fame settings for all Sims can be set in the Game Options.
Quit the Spotlight
Sims with Fame Perks can't quit the spotlight. To remove Fame Perks from a Sim, use the phone or computer to Book a Celebrity Cleanse.
Stay Out of the Spotlight?
WARNING: This action will reset any fame gained by this Sim to zero. If the Sim steps back into the spotlight later, they will restart from there.\n\nOnce out of the spotlight, the Sim will not gain any fame or become a celebrity. This button will then allow them to reverse this decision at any time.
This Sim will be able to gain fame and become a celebrity. Default fame settings for all Sims can be set in the Game Options.

I recommend checking out &lt;b&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Oasis Springs!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nYou can always get more info on a World by hovering over it.
Welcome to &lt;b&gt;Residential Worlds,&lt;/b&gt; where you get to choose the perfect world for your Household to live!
This World does not have any good starter Lots for you. I recommend you select &lt;b&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Oasis Springs&lt;/b&gt; instead for now!
Continue Anyway
Never Mind
This Lot doesn't have a starter home built on it. I recommend you move to one that has a starter home instead!
Bulldozing a Lot will result in no house being present. I recommend moving into a Furnished home instead!
No Starter Homes
If you decide to start on this World, you'll need to &lt;b&gt;build&lt;/b&gt; the entire home for your Household. But don't worry! You can always go back to the &lt;b&gt;Residential Worlds!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI'd recommend going back and selecting &lt;b&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Oasis Springs&lt;/b&gt; instead.
Furnished
This screen allows you to select a move in option. Since this is your first starter home, try selecting &lt;b&gt;&quot;Furnished&quot;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nDon't like the flow of things? You can always redecorate or change your furniture later!

Interaction
Adding a new Vacation Rental lot to any world is easy! Travel to any lot that does not have a Household already occupying it. Once in Build Mode, on the upper left hand side of the screen, select the Venue Info icon. From there, the venue can be changed to “Vacation Rental” from the Lot Type drop down. This lot is now a Vacation Rental Lot. While in Build Mode, be sure to place any objects you’d like to have available to future vacationers.
While on vacation, Build Mode is locked. Sims on vacation in Residential Worlds may purchase necessities on their phone in the Household section with the “Order Supplies Now…” interaction. Destination Worlds have unique locations to purchase supplies for that world.
When Sims reserve their home away from home, the active Household must pay daily rent up front. Rent is dependent on the Lot Value for the selected Lot. There is a drop down that allows players to choose how many days they would like their vacationers to rent the lot. A total tally of cost is displayed on the bottom right hand side of this menu. Helpful Tip: Once in game, Sims may use the Travel section of their Phone to choose to extend their vacation or end it early. 
Upgrades
Some Upgrade benefits will make objects perform better, not break, or provide emotional benefits to Sims.
As your Handiness Skill improves, you'll be able to find rare Upgrade Parts and unlock more powerful upgrades.
Sims in the Focused Emotion will generally be better at upgrading household items.
Sims need to use Upgrade Parts to upgrade items. These can be found in piles of junk next to broken objects or even in garbage cans!\n\nYou can also purchase upgrade parts from the Order menu, if you have enough Handiness skill.
Traits
Sims gain Reward Traits by completing Aspirations or can purchase new Traits with Satisfaction at the Rewards Store.
Sims gain new Personality Traits when they age up, up to 3 total when they become young adults.
Personality Traits give Sims unique interactions, behaviors, and preferences throughout their life.
Writing Skill
Writing is an art that takes time. As Sims develop their Writing skill, they'll be able to write more interesting Books which will earn more Simoleons in Royalties.
Sims who are dedicated enough writers can write as their career.
Sims in the Inspired emotion will generally be better Writers.
Violin Skill
Sims with a higher level Violin skill will learn new, more challenging Songs, unlock new musical interactions, and will be able to Write Songs.
Sims in the Inspired emotion will generally be better Violinists.
Sims who write Songs via the Violin can License them on the Mailbox to earn Royalty Payments.

Gardening Skill
There are several ways you can speed the evolution process of your plant. Fertilization is often the fastest method. You can Fertilize plants with almost anything--from fruits to fish. The more valuable your Fertilizer, the more of a boost your plant will get.
As you level your Gardening skill you will gain access to new gardening techniques such as fertilizing or splicing. All of which you can use to become the best agriculturalist you can be.
To have your Sim start gardening, you will need to acquire some seeds. Seeds can be purchased through Planter Boxes found in Build Mode or from a computer.\n\nPurchased seeds can be found in your Sim's inventory.
When you plant your first seed click on it to Water, Weed, or Spray for Insects. Your plant's visual state should provide information about what it needs. Your plant's happiness is determined by three factors: Infestation, Water, and Weeds.\n\nThe better you take care of your plant, the faster you can Evolve it.
Once you become skilled enough, you will be able to combine plants by taking a cutting from one plant and grafting it to another. Doing this will cause the plant to grow both crops from one plant. It may also create special seeds.
Having a high Gardening skill allows you to Evolve plants. There are five Evolutions in total, stage one being normal and stage five being perfect. The more evolved your plant, the more valuable their harvest will become.

Controlling Sims
When you select something in an Interaction menu, it will appear in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Action Queue&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nIf you’re in a hurry (or changed your mind), you can click on any actions in the queue to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;cancel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Right-click&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on a Sim’s thumbnail to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;center the Game Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on them.\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Home icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will appear when your Sim is away from their home lot. Clicking this will send them home.\n\nAn &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Away Action icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; appears on Sims who are not in the currently loaded Neighborhood. Clicking it will display different options for you to direct your Sim from afar. You can also choose to bring that Sim to you, or send yourself to that Sim through this menu.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Click&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the ground, an Object, or a Sim to reveal the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Interaction menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nHere you will find all the Interactions your controlled Sim has available with the thing you clicked on. More interactions can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unlocked&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with higher Relationship scores, Skill levels etc.
Sims will do things &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;on their own&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but why let them have all the fun? Shape your Sims’ lives by giving them some much needed &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;guidance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you can find a row of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;thumbnails&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, representing each Sim in your current household. This is where you select which Sim to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;control&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nYou can also use the [Spacebar] to change your active Sim.\n\nYour active Sim has a green, yellow, orange, or red crystal hovering above their head. That's the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plumbob&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Its color indicates the state of the Sim's Needs.
Sentiments
Sentiments are how a Sim feels about another Sim based on recent past experiences. There are Positive and Negative Sentiments, which can influence a Sim’s Mood and behavior when the other Sim is around! These are discovered naturally through gameplay and will fade over time. The amount of time it takes for a Sentiment to fade depends on if it is a Long-Term or Short-Term Sentiment. \n\nNew experiences together can also make existing Sentiments fade more quickly or more slowly. Positive Sentiments are easily eroded by very negative experiences, and a successful apology goes a long way towards healing any Negative Sentiments. The colored backdrop behind a Sentiment icon indicates how far it is along in the fading process.\n\nA Sim may have up to four Sentiments about another Sim at a time. If a Sim acquires more than four Sentiments about a particular Sim, the least important Sentiment will be replaced.
You can see which Sentiments your Sim has about another Sim while they are having a conversation by clicking the Sentiment icon on the Conversation Panel at the top center of the screen. This will reveal details on any acquired Sentiments with that Sim.
You can also see which Sentiments your Sim has about another Sim from the Sim's Profile, as well as the Sentiments that the other Sim has about your Sim. To view a Sim's Profile, click on the Relationships panel and find the desired Sim. Click on the Sim’s picture and choose “&lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;”. Sentiment information is located in the “Sentiments” dropdown.
If you complete a Scenario goal, your Sims will be rewarded with things like Traits, Potions, or even Satisfaction Points to use in the Rewards Store. \n\nThe Rewards Store can be accessed from a Sim's Aspiration Panel.\n \nThere are many ways to complete a Scenario, so try out new strategies and ways to play!
Romance
Different relationships offer different and interesting social possibilities available to your Sims. Begin exploring all the Romance options!
Successfully Romancing with a Sim improves the romantic aspect of their relationship.
A secondary relationship bar will appear to track your Romance. Your relationship with other Sims change as a result of both friendship and romance levels.
Relationships
The better the relationship, the more interesting the social possibilities available to your Sim!
Information a Sim learns about another Sim is stored within the &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sim's Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. This includes information on their current relationship.\n\nTo view a Sim's Profile, click on the &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relationships&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; panel and find the desired Sim. Click on the Sim’s picture and choose “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;”. Relationship information is located in the “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relationship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;” dropdown.\n\nYou also can open the Profile of another Sim by clicking on that Sim and choosing “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;” from the “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;” category.
Socializing with other Sims is a great way to improve your Sim's Social Need.
Relationships between Sims of different ages will now face different advantages and challenges. Sims will gain or lose relationship at different speeds depending on both the types of interaction &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; the age of the other Sim.\n\nFor example, Child Sims will become friends much faster with other Child Sims, since they understand each other so well. But a Child Sim will find it a bit more difficult to raise their relationship with a Teen or Young Adult Sim, who might take the Child less seriously than their peers. Adult Sims will struggle to raise their relationship with Teen Sims, as Teens will often see them as uncool. But Adult Sims will have a much easier time befriending Elders.
Sims improve relationships when having positive social interactions with other Sims.
Fitness Skill
Athletic Sims lead healthier lives and will push back any excess weight gain from over-eating.
Sims in the Energized Emotion will generally exercise better.
Sims with higher Fitness Skill can Mentor and Train others of lower Fitness Skill.
Positive Emotions
Experiment with different activities to discover new positive Emotions. Be sure to inspect the Emotion's benefit by hovering over your Sims portrait in the HUD, to take full advantage of them.
Different positive Emotions convey different benefits. For example, Inspired sims are better at creative activities. 
New interactions become available and others disappear based on your Sims' emotions.
Positive emotions should be seen as an opportunity to accomplish great things. Experiment as your Sims navigate the emotional landscape.
Paying Bills
Additional Power or Water utility that the player generates for the week is detailed on the right side of this menu. These utilities are automatically set to Auto Sell and will deduct from the weekly bill when it arrives. Toggling them to Store will allow the player to accrue Power or Water until a cap is reached. Excess Power or Water utility may be sold at any time by pressing the Sell Now button.
As Sims buy more items and increase the value of their home, their bills will increase. Bills are primarily comprised of a tax on the lot’s value as well as the utility usage of objects in the form of Power and Water. 
Not paying bills will result in the possible loss of your utilities, such as Power and Water. If bills remain delinquent long enough the Repo Person will arrive and take objects to pay off any debts. 
Bills arrive in the mailbox. They can be paid via the computer, your phone, or on the mailbox.\n\nYou will get a notification reminder before your bills become late.
Click the “Show Bills Information” interaction on any mailbox to view additional information pertaining to Bills and Utilities. Hover over any line item title in the Current Billing Estimate section of the menu to learn what is affecting your upcoming bill. See the current estimate to the right.
Off-the-Grid
Family
Falling in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;love&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;children&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and spending time with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relatives&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be a very meaningful part of your Sim’s life! 
When your Sims develop a romantic Relationship, you can eventually ask to become &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;romantic partners&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;propose&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can find these social interactions in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Romance category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nOnce engaged, two Sims can get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;married&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;elope&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; interaction or plan a wedding by using the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plan a Social Event&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; option in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Cell Phone’s Social app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
There are two ways to have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;children&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Try for Baby&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Social interaction, or the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adoption service&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; found through Hire a Service in the Cell Phone’s Home app.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Try for Baby&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; becomes available once a Sim who can get pregnant and a Sim who can impregnate build a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;strong romantic Relationship&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adoption service&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is available for couples as well as singles.
Emotions
Taking care of your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and participating in activities associated with their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (such as reading books if you have the Bookworm Trait) are good ways to get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;positive Moodlets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;negative Moodlets go away&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; faster with some &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;self care&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Taking a shower, using the mirror for a pep talk or to calm down, or crying in bed may be helpful, depending on what Emotion your Sim is dealing with.
Sims are feeling creatures! Their current mood, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, has a big impact on what they do and how they do it. \n\nA &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;positive Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; may help your Sim to build &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, develop &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and get promoted in their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Negative Emotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, however, may cause your Sims to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;fail&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at things or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;stop&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them from doing those things altogether until they feel better.\n
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is based on their current &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Moodlets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nEach Moodlet has a different strength, duration, and associated Emotion. The main &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;source&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Moodlets are your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and recent &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;experiences&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can see your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;current Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Moodlets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;portrait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Hover the cursor over the Sim or a Moodlet to learn more!
Aspirations
Hover the cursor over each &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Goal&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for more information. As your Sim completes these Goals, they will get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Satisfaction Points&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that can be spent in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Reward Store&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is what they aspire to be, do, and experience! In &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, this is represented by the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration Goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. These can help you set the course of your Sim’s life!
Most &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have multiple &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, each with their own set of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. When all of them are completed, your Sim will get a powerful &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Reward Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nYou can see your current Stage and the Reward Trait by hovering the cursor over the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your current Aspiration, use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Select New Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.
Aging &amp; Death
Follow your Sims from the cradle to the grave. As time goes on, Sims will &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and go through seven &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Life Stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Baby&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Toddler&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Teenager&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Young Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Elder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nEach Life Stage offers unique &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;experiences&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;challenges&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Some Sims may have an &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;accident&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; before they reach the golden years of elderhood. \n\nBeware of fire, swimming while tired, and huge chunks of rock hurling towards you from the sky. Or you know, don’t, and see what happens!
You can modify the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lifespan&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Sims, and which Sims age and which don’t. Open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and navigate to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gameplay&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tab.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Auto aging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is on by default for Played Sims. This includes your current &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;active Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and other &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Households&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;played&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; previously. \n\nIf you want your active Household to age, but not your other Households, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Only Active Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Auto Age (Played Households)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; setting.
Dying isn’t the end! When Sims meet their untimely (or timely) demise, a Sim can begin a new chapter by becoming a Ghost.\n\nBy choosing &lt;b&gt;Become a Playable Ghost&lt;/b&gt;, the Sim will remain in the Household and continue to be playable as a Ghostly presence.\nChoose &lt;b&gt;Become a Freeroaming Ghost&lt;/b&gt; if you would prefer this Sim &lt;i&gt;live on&lt;/i&gt; as a Ghost in an unplayed Household. These Sims will no longer be a played Sim but can still be found in the World.
Live Mode
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the game Mode in which your Sim, well, live! You can tell your Sims what to do in order to shape their lives, or see what they get up to on their own.\n\nThere’s a lot you can do in Live Mode, but to get you started, here are some basic tips: manage your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; so they can be their best selves, join a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to make some money, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;explore&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the world to meet other Sims and discover new activities!
Lessons
Lessons are divided into &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which each cover a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Pack&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Within Categories there are also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Subcategories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you can open to find even more Lessons. \n\nSelecting a Category or Subcategory gives you a short &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;overview&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of its content.
In the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; library you’ll find information about everything from how to customize unique Sims and mastering the build tools to how you make your Sims rich and happy (or poor and miserable, if that’s your style.)\n\nCurrently, you’re in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Getting Started Category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Lessons. Here you can find all the basic knowledge you need to start playing.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the basics, feel free to browse through the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;other Categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for more in depth information and inspiration.
What Should I Do Next?
Some Sims want to be the best, maxing out as many &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Careers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as they can!\n\nA true &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;virtuoso&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; might work hard to climb the ranks of the Musician branch of the Entertainment Career while leveling every instrument Skill, while a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;foodie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; dedicates themselves to the Cooking, Gourmet Cooking, and Mixology Skills as well as the Food Aspirations.\n\nMastering Skills is also a great way to make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; why not build your fortune creating &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;masterpieces&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the Painting Skill or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hacking&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the Programming Skill?
Last but not least, let your creative juices flow in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Play around with the tools and explore the Object catalog to discover the depth of possibility this game mode has to offer.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Recreating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a building you’ve visited or lived in, or a floorplan you found online, can be a fun challenge. You could also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;research&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; different architectural and interior design styles, and create your own &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;interpretations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Leave reality behind&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and pull your inspiration from fairy tales and science fiction; who wouldn’t love to live in a giant mushroom or spaceship?
A popular playstyle among Simmers (Sims fans) is playing the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;same family, generation after generation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and growing an impressive family tree! \n\nHaving babies and nurturing them as they age up to Toddlers, Children, and Teenagers allows you to play with all the different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;life stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nDid you know the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fertile Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the Reward Store increases your chances of having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;twins and triplets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;?
In The Sims 4, only your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;imagination&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sets the limits! But sometimes, with near endless possibilities, it can be hard to know where to start. Let us offer some &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;suggestions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
The world is full of things to discover! &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Explore each Neighborhood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and experience what they have to offer. New places also offer new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Collectibles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; such as harvestable plants, fishes, fossils, and crystals.\n\nWhy not &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;show off your discoveries&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at home with shelves filled with fossils, aquariums with rare fish, or a flourishing garden with rare (perhaps even &lt;i&gt;supernatural&lt;/i&gt;) plants? \n\nSome &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;secrets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; exist outside the edges of the World Map. If you were to encounter a strange tree or an old mine entrance, perhaps you should take a closer look… 
Why not experiment with how Sims &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;interact&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and what impact different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Social Interactions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have on their relationships? Become the life of the party, an irresistible heartbreaker, or spread chaos wherever you go! \n\nTry one of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Love&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Popularity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Deviance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; categories for some inspiration, or work on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Charisma&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Comedy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Mischief&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Skill to unlock unique interactions.\n\nSims who reach Mischief level 3 can buy a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;voodoo doll&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; via a computer. Better stay on their good side…
Explore every facet of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Create a Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and see how far you can push the customization tools! Why not try to create yourself, a friend, a fairytale character, or a celebrity?\n\nWhat kind of character would make for a great &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;friend&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;enemy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;love interest&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for your Sim? Create them, add them to your world, and see what happens!\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Media tropes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be a great source of inspiration. Who is your version of the gold digger, the nosy neighbor, the hopeless romantic, the secretive hacker, or the evil genius?
Gallery
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an amazing place where you can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;share&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your creations, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;download&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; creations made by other Players! There are thousands of Households, Lots, and Rooms to discover.\n\nUse the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to open the Gallery. It’s available in all Game Modes.
To share one of your own creations, select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save Household button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Create a Sim or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save to My Library button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Build Mode.\n\nThis will open a window in which you can enter a description of your creation and either &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save to My Library&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Share to the Gallery&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
In the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery tab&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you can browse through all &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;uploaded creations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;filters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the left and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;search bar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the top to help you find what you’re looking for.
Once you’ve found something you like, you can add it to your game with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Place button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or save it for later with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save to My Library button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
Screenshots &amp; Videos
Capture your best (or worst) Sims moments with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;screenshots&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;videos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! In Live Mode, in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Camera Options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you can access buttons to take a screenshot, start and stop recording a video, and open the Screenshot Capture Manager.\n\nYou can also take screenshots with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;[C]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; key and record videos with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;[V]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; key on your keyboard. These shortcuts allow you to take screenshots in Create a Sim, and take screenshots and videos in Build Mode.\n\nCheck out the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Camera Control Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to learn more about how to control the Game Camera so you can line up the perfect shot!
In the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Screenshot Capture Manager&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you can delete and add descriptions to screenshots.\n\nYou can also access your screenshots and videos in a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;folder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on your computer. It’s located at Documents &gt; Electronic Arts &gt; The Sims 4  &gt; Screenshots, or Recorded Videos.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Time&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; goes by, hour by hour, day by day. But in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have the power to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;control&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it!\n\nAt the bottom of the screen you can see the&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt; current day&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;time&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and access the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;time control buttons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Pause, Normal Speed, Fast Speed, and Ultra Speed). You can also use the [0], [1], [2], and [3] keys on your keyboard.\n\nWhen all the Sims on the Lot are &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;asleep&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and you go to Ultra Speed, time goes by even faster!
Camera Controls (Build &amp; Live Mode)
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; also has a secret &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;First Person Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Hold down [Shift] and press [Tab] on the keyboard to toggle it.\n\nLeft click with the mouse as usual to interact with the world around you. You can right click through walls to move to the other side.
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;pan&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (move around) the camera, hold the scroll wheel (TS4 Camera) or the right mouse button (TS3 Camera) and move the mouse, or use the arrows or [W], [A], [S], and [D] keys on the keyboard.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the camera, hold the right mouse button (TS4 Camera) or the scroll wheel (TS3 camera) and move the mouse. You can only tilt the camera vertically with the Sims 3 Camera Style.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Zoom in and out&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; using the mouse scroll wheel or the [+] and [-] keys on the keyboard.
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Free Cam&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is great for taking screenshots and videos. Toggle it with the [Tab] key on the keyboard.\n\nMove the mouse and then use the [W], [A], [S], [D], [Q], and [E] keys on the keyboard to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;position the Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and use the scroll wheel to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;zoom in and out&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move between floors&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, use the Go Up to Next Floor and Go Down to Lower Floor buttons, or use the [Page Up] and [Page Down] keys on the keyboard.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hide or show the walls&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, use the Walls View button or the [Home] and [End] keys on the keyboard to rotate between the settings.
In &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; there’s a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;top-down Camera angle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you can toggle with the Top Down View button or the [T] key on the keyboard.
The game has three different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Camera Styles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: The default &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;The Sims 4 Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;The Sims 3 Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Free Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can change the Camera Style in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Camera Controls menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; section of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (in The Sims 3 Camera, you also can invert the camera rotation).
Controls
How does one move the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;game camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, take &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;screenshots and videos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;control &lt;i&gt;time itself&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;? Look no further, you’ll find all the answers in the Lessons below!
Cheats
A great Build Mode cheat is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bb.moveObjects on&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This allows you to place items in locations that would otherwise be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;invalid&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Be aware that some Objects might not work as intended when placed at an invalid location, but it works great for things like lush gardens and cluttered corners.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bb.ignoreGameplayUnlocksEntitlement&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be used to unlock otherwise locked Objects in the Build catalog, such as Career rewards.
Who said you had to work hard to make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;? Just use the following cheat codes in the console:\n \n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;motherlode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gives the Household 50,000 Simoleons.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;kaching&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gives the Household 1,000 Simoleons.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;FreeRealEstate on&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be activated in the World Map to make all houses cost 0 Simoleons.
Bend the rules a little and try some &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;cheats&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Cheating is not a bad thing if it makes your experience more fun. \n\nTo toggle the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;cheat console&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, press &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;[Ctrl] + [Shift] + [C]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on your keyboard. Then, write a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;cheat code&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the console and press &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;[Enter]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to activate it.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;testingcheats on&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a very special cheat code that unlocks more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;advanced&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cheats. \n\nFor example, after using this cheat code, you can use &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sims.fill_all_commodities&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cheat code to fill the Needs of all the Sims in the Household. \n\nYou can also hold down the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;[Shift]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; key on the keyboard while &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;clicking&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a Sim, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Cheat Need…&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Make Happy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to max out all Needs, or disable Needs decay entirely by selecting &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Disable Need Decay&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Identity &amp; Personality 
Outfits
You can also browse the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Styled Looks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; library for Outfits! Use them as they are, or as a starting point for your own styling. \n\nSwap between Styled Looks with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;arrows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the bottom of the menu. Each Styled Look comes in several &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;colors&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to choose from.
The most important part of an outfit is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Clothes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Or the lack thereof. Select your Sim’s body to try some on!\n\nYour Sim can either wear a top and a bottom piece, or a full body piece. To browse each category, select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Tops&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bottoms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Full Body&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; buttons.
To further &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;style&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your outfits, you can add makeup, nail polish, jewelry, glasses, shoes, hats, gloves, socks, and leggings!\n\nSelect your Sim’s head to reveal the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, head &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Makeup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; categories. \n\nYou can access the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Shoes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and body &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; categories by selecting your Sim’s body.
An &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Outfit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a combination of clothes, hair, accessories, shoes, hats, and make up. Your Sims have several &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Outfit categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; Everyday, Formal, Athletic, Sleepwear, Party, Swimwear, Hot Weather, and Cold weather!\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Switch&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; between the Outfit categories to create an outfit for every occasion!
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is what they aspire to be, do, and experience! Your Sim will get optional &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; based on their Aspiration that can be completed for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nPick something that sounds fun! You can always &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Aspiration later if you change your mind.
To customize your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Pick a Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button and pick Traits until all Trait slots are filled.\n\nTraits have an &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;impact&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on everything from Emotions and Skills to Hobbies and Relationships. Hover the cursor over the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Trait icons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to learn more.\n\nSome &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;useful Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are Cheerful, Creative, and Flirty. These will help your Sim have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;positive Emotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
Who is your Sim? You can customize their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;name&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Identity panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can open and close the identity panel with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plumbob button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the top left corner. 
Hair
You can also change the style and color of your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eyebrows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Select them to display these options. \n\nMale Sims can have beards and mustaches. Click their face and then &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Facial Hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to try it out!
Does your Sim have raven locks, beach blond braids, or blue spikes? Customize their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by clicking it!\n\nYou can select your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hair color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the top of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hairstyle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; menu, and select a style below.
Face &amp; Body
To customize your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skin Tone&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their body, then the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Body&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button, and then &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skin Tones&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nThere’s a wide range of tones to choose from!
Select your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;face&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to customize it! You can either &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Click and Drag&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a part of the face to sculpt it, or click a part of the face and choose a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Preset&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the menu on the right.\n\nIf you select the eyes, you can also change &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eye color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;body shape&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be adjusted with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Muscle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fat sliders&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the left of your Sim.\n\nIn the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Body&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; menu you can also open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bodies&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; catalog to choose from a list of body type &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Presets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Adding Sims &amp; Relationships
To create a Sim that looks like one of the existing Sims in the household, you can select&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt; Play with Genetics&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nSelect a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;starting Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (or Sims), what kind of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relative&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you want to add (Parent, Child, or Sibling), the new Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then hit &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Randomize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; until you’re happy! Don’t forget to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Confirm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. 
Households can have up to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;8 Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Add more Sims by clicking on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Add a Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.\n\nChoose &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Add New Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to randomize a new Sim to customize. If you want some help setting up a backstory and personality for your new Sim, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Add Sim via a Story&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
You can set &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; between the Sims in your household in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Household Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; menu in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Identity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; panel.
Create a Sim
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Create a Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the game mode in which—you guessed it —&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sims are created&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nYou can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;customize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s appearance, identity, personality, relationships, and more! So why not try to recreate yourself and your friends, or make the most unique Sims you can imagine?
Useful Objects
The most &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;essential&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Objects help you care for your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. A bed, toilet, shower, fridge, stove, counters, and an entertainment Object such as a TV or bookcase cover the basics!\n\nAs your Sim makes more money, it’s a good idea to buy more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;expensive&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; versions of these Objects, as they fill Needs more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;effectively&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Objects that help you build &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are also very useful. You can see which Skills an Object can raise in the Object’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;tooltip&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nSome good &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;examples&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are the chess table (Logic Skill), computer (Programming, Writing, Video Game Skills), mirror (Charisma Skill), instruments (Guitar, Violin, Piano Skills), bar (Mixology Skill), and garden pot (Gardening Skill).\n\nYou can find most Skill Objects in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Activities and Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; category if you browse by Function.
Here are some other &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;useful&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Objects!\n\nA &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;trash can&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sink&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;fire alarm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will help your Sims keep their home clean and safe.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Dining or Desk Chairs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are required to use Objects such as Desks and Chess Tables. Make sure the Chair snaps to the Table when you place it!\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lights&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will make it easier to see at night and nice &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Decorations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will give your Sims Happy Moodlets.
Styling Homes
You can change &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;swatch&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, on most Objects with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Design Tool&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This is totally free!
Changing the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Floor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Ceiling&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wall patterns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of a room can give it a huge lift for a very small cost!\n\nFloor, Ceiling, and Wall patterns can be placed one floor tile or wall at a time, or a whole room at a time by switching the setting above the Pattern categories.\n\nSelecting a pattern while in the Ceiling category will allow you to preview and change your Ceiling.
You can find &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;decor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, such as rugs and houseplants, by browsing Objects by Function and selecting &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Decorations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the dropdown.\n\nWhen the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the decor in a room is high enough, your Sims will get a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Happy Moodlet&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; when they spend time there!
The right &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;styling&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; truly makes a house a home! Changing &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Floor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Ceiling&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wall patterns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, customizing the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of furniture, and adding &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;decor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; go a long way. Just be mindful of your budget!
When you &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;extend&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your home, you might find yourself with exposed drywall, missing windows, and mismatched roofs.\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Eyedropper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool allows you to click on something you &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;already own&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then either &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;apply the same pattern&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to an existing feature or buy a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;new copy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, depending on what you clicked.
Building with Styled Rooms
Buying &amp; Placing Objects
You can browse the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Object Catalog&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Room&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Function&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with where Objects are located in the Catalog. Don’t forget to scroll!\n\nYou can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;search&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for types of Objects or individual Object names.
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in your house help your Sims to manage their Needs and Emotions, improving their Skills, and socializing with other Sims.\n\nWhen you &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;buy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; new Objects, it’s important to keep your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Household funds&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (how much money they have) in mind. \n\nOr use a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money cheat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, more on that in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Cheats Lesson&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Eyedropper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a very useful tool for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;buying a copy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of something you already own, such as adding more chairs to a table! \n\nSimply select the Eyedropper from the menu at the top of the screen, select an Object in your house, and place the new copy.\n\nYou can also use the Eyedropper as a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;shortcut&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to a specific &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Catalog&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; category (for example, selecting a bed to open the Beds category).
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;buy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;place&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; an item, simply select it from the Catalog, move the cursor to where you want to place it, and click! The Object’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;footprint&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; must be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which means there is enough space.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a held Object, click the right mouse button, [CTRL + RMB] will rotate in the opposite direction. \n\nYou can also select an already bought Object to move and rotate it, or sell it by pressing the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sell button&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Basic Building
When you add or extend a Room, you probably want to adjust the house’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Roof&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to match.\n\nYou can either select an existing Roof piece and use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;resizing arrows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or place a new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Roof piece&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the Roof menu.
You can also make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;new Rooms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by using the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wall and Room Tools&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; found in the Walls and Empty Rooms category. Simply click, drag, and release to place a new Wall or Room!
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;modify&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;upgrade&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your home, there are some essential &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode tools&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you should know about.\n\nSelecting an existing Room by clicking on its floor or walls reveals arrows that allow you to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change the shape&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the room. You can also change &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wall Height&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this way!
To allow Sims and light to enter your new Room, it needs &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Doors&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Windows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, found in the Doors and Windows Catalogs respectively. They are sorted by Wall Height.\n\nSelect a Door or Window from the Catalog, move the cursor to a wall, and click to place. The Door or Window will snap to the Wall if there’s enough space.
Build Mode
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is where you spend your hard earned Simoleons (the Sim currency) to buy better &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and upgrade your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;home&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nSelect the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to get started.
Selecting an Aspiration Track is not a permanent decision - Sims can pursue any and all Aspiration tracks at once.\n\nSelecting an Aspiration to track will displays Notifications when those objectives are completed.
Aspirations are mid- to long-range goals for Sims that help guide them through their lifetime.
When creating Sims in CAS, you select an initial Aspiration Track to put that character on a suggested progression path.

Who could blame the thief after all?
The thief had the right intentions, but the wrong methods.\n\nAs a fan of time, they wanted to bring everything from the past to preserve in the present, and keep for the future.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss seems embarrassed and avoids talking to {M0.him}{F0.her} for the rest of the day. Hopefully this won’t factor into any performance ratings.
{0.SimFirstName} takes the cautious approach and waits to see if the start-up has what it takes to succeed. By the time it’s clear that they do, everyone has caught on and the opportunity to get in early is lost.
{0.SimFirstName}’s early investment is just what the start-up needed to complete their first deliverable. Now they’re the talk of the business world and everyone wishes they had gotten in early.
{0.SimFirstName} may have put too much faith in the start-up. It seems that the extra pressure of having a famous investor behind them was too much to handle. The start-up crashes and burns along with {0.SimFirstName}'s investment.
{0.SimFirstName} is able to close a deal which will surely lead to massive profits!
{0.SimFirstName}’s offer is refused because a competitor has already offered them a higher price. This missed opportunity will not reflect well on {M0.him}{F0.her}.
The owners of the business are so ecstatic that they share some promising new ideas they were planning to implement. {0.SimFirstName}’s kindness looks like it will pay off well in future profits!
{0.SimFirstName} is too busy running a business to be bothered with a vanity project like this. {M0.He}{F0.She} goes back to analyzing spreadsheets.
Upon release, {0.SimFirstName}’s book shoots to the top of the best-seller list, displacing the Gobias CEO’s #1 spot. With all the positive attention, {0.SimFirstName} sees shareholder confidence soar! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} will use the profits from the book for a nice vacation.
Upon release, {0.SimFirstName}’s book is universally panned. Shareholder confidence is shaken and {0.SimFirstName} will have to field embarrassing questions about the book for the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} life.
{0.SimFirstName} takes the critical board member out to lunch to discuss their concerns. After some friendly conversation, compromises are made on both sides so that they can put this disagreement behind them.
During the next board meeting {0.SimFirstName} directly addresses the critic's concerns. {M0.He}{F0.She} makes a compelling case for why {M0.his}{F0.her} vision is the right one for the company and the critic is silenced.
During the next board meeting {0.SimFirstName} directly addresses the critic's concerns. Unfortunately, nobody seems convinced and {0.SimFirstName} is forced to make some concessions regarding {M0.his}{F0.her} plans for this quarter.
{0.SimFirstName} catches some flak for hiring an outsider, but nobody can deny that the new applicant is a perfect fit for the position. {0.SimFirstName} is congratulated for keeping the company fresh and increasing productivity.
Not everyone reacts well to {0.SimFirstName}’s decision to hire an outsider. Although the new hire is performing well, employee morale has taken a hit. {0.SimFirstName} will have to figure out how to regain the trust of {M0.his}{F0.her} employees and boost morale.
Promoting from within will ensure a smooth transition since the loyal employee already has relationships with the people they will be working with. {0.SimFirstName} is congratulated for keeping things running smoothly and promoting internal talent.
{0.SimFirstName} takes on the new job. There's plenty of room to move up at the new company, so {M0.he}{F0.she} should expect a promotion soon!
Loyalty can be a good thing. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss catches on to the offer and gives {0.SimFirstName} a bit of a cash bonus as extra incentive to stay!
The game is always more important than the press!  {0.SimFirstName} has a wonderful match, but has left the ownership cold at their lack of media decorum
{0.SimFirstName} answers every question thoughtfully and articulately, then pulls a muscle thirty seconds into the game, and is sore for the rest of the day.
{0.SimFirstName} stands still and watches as security goes after the thief. I mean, that's their job after all. It's back to doing the laundry for {0.SimFirstName}...
{0.SimFirstName} rushes down the hall after the fleeing fan. {M0.He}{F0.She} reaches out for their arm, but catches onto the stolen t-shirt instead. The Sim hesitates briefly before letting go of the shirt and running away. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} got the shirt because on second glance it's clear that this is the star player's lucky shirt!
{0.SimFirstName} starts to cough meekly and sits down on the bench. The crowd reacts to the lack of entertainment with a chorus of boos.
{0.SimFirstName} walks out onto the floor and starts to dance. The crowd looks on uneasily for a moment before one brave fan runs onto the floor and starts dancing beside {0.SimFirstName}. Masses of fans hit the floor and the stadium bursts into a giant dance party!
“Fine! There’s no rule that says the coach can’t take the kick either!” The coach rumbles onto the field, and the team is promptly disqualified, as there is in fact such a rule. At least it wasn’t {0.SimFirstName}’s fault!
The animal legs are a daunting hindrance, but {0.SimFirstName} strikes the ball cleanly, and the kick is good! {M0.He}{F0.She} is carried off the field by cheering fans!
{0.SimFirstName} stumbles as {M0.he}{F0.she} approaches the ball, and falls face first while taking the kick. It’s not even close. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should have taken the costume off first...
Sometimes you need to know when you’re beat. {0.SimFirstName} kicks back and enjoys the chance to watch the rest of game, even though their team loses.
{0.SimFirstName} gives it {M0.his}{F0.her} all to the point of exhaustion, but nothing short of a natural disaster is getting the crowd back into a frenzy. Still, ownership noted the effort and was extremely pleased!
{0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} might be over-reacting. While the crowd certainly wants a fight, {0.SimFirstName} won’t give in to the pressure; {M0.he}{F0.she} IS a professional after all.
No stupid lemur’s stealing {0.SimFirstName}’s dignity! {M0.He}{F0.She} takes them out hard, and the crowd goes WILD! {0.SimFirstName} is fined by the league, but the morale boost {M0.he}{F0.she} gave the team was enormous!
{0.SimFirstName} concocts a beverage using some salt, sugar, and fruit. This {0.SimLastName}ade is surprisingly tasty, and the team loves it!
It’s just water, salt, and lemon, right? Apparently not. The team refuses to drink the concoction, and many dehydrate.
Good ol’ water. Plain, reliable, liquid. It gets the hydration job done well enough!
{0.SimFirstName} greedily grabs the cake and proceeds to eat it very slowly. Savoring each and every bite. This decision will definitely have negative consequences, but {M0.he}{F0.she} sure is one happy Sim right now.
{0.SimFirstName} respectfully refuses the cake offered to {M0.him}{F0.her}. It was the proper course of action, even if {0.SimFirstName} is now filled with an immense sadness.
{0.SimFirstName} strides out onto the stage and begins flexing. The judges look carefully at {0.SimFirstName} before holding up their assessments. 7-6-8. Not winning scores. Better luck next time.
{0.SimFirstName} applies the new tanning lotion before stepping out into the spotlight. The judges are so awed by the sight of {M0.him}{F0.her} that they immediately stop The BIG Contest and declare {0.SimFirstName} the winner. What was in that lotion?
{0.SimFirstName} begins {M0.his}{F0.her} routine and things are going smoothly. When suddenly, pressure builds inside {0.SimFirstName} then promptly releases itself. The gym erupts into pointing and laughing. So embarassed by the spectacle, {0.SimFirstName} quickly exits the premises.
{0.SimFirstName} rushes to the bathroom and prepares for battle. Despite overwhelming opposition, {M0.he}{F0.she} emerges triumphant! {0.SimFirstName} then channels the energy of victory into the greatest work out of all time!
{0.SimFirstName} can be quite persuasive when {M0.he}{F0.she} chooses to be. The star insists it was all just a bit of joking and pledges to lay off from now on.
The star scoffs at {0.SimFirstName}’s accusation, then turns around and complains about {0.SimFirstName}'s performance to the coaches. What a jerk...
{0.SimFirstName} decides to just put up with the obnoxious star’s nonsense, and ends up in a very bad mood.
{0.SimFirstName} decides against taking the unknown beverage.  Who needs vaguely citrus flavored chemicals to feel good anyway?
The drink is delicious!  {0.SimFirstName} feels energized and ready to attack the day with a renewed, citrusy vigor!
The drink tastes like having your brain smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.  {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t feel too good…
{0.SimFirstName} explains that phonebooks aren’t {M0.his}{F0.her} specialty, and offers to sign the book instead.  The boy is disappointed, but still happy to have talked to their idol.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath, and wrenches the phonebook.  Miraculously, it tears cleanly down the middle!  What strength!  The boy is ecstatic!
{0.SimFirstName} tries their hardest, but they can’t pull off the trick!  The boy looks on in shocked disbelief at their failing hero. Something was torn up that day, and that was a young boy’s dream…
There’s no need to turn themselves into spectacle, or worse, to get hurt! {0.SimFirstName} removes some weight and continues {M0.his}{F0.her} routine; the personal best can wait for another day.
{0.SimFirstName} grunts, groans, and with a mighty bellow, hoists the barbell up!! {0.SimFirstName} may have made a spectacle of {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, but anyone that turned to look was impressed by the sight of {M0.him}{F0.her} lifting an incredible amount of weight!
{0.SimFirstName} lets out a grunt, then a screech, and then an echoing guttural snarl, which causes the entire gym to stop and stare.  Unfortunately, these noises did not help with the lifting whatsoever, leaving {0.SimFirstName} hunched over and embarrassed.
Some extra money would have been nice, but {0.SimFirstName} only wants to endorse things they know well. {M0.His}{F0.Her} conviction doesn’t go unnoticed.
{0.SimFirstName} gets a hefty check out of the endorsement deal.  However, when word gets out that the product is nothing more than talcum powder and vanilla extract, {M0.he}{F0.she} loses some respect amongst {M0.his}{F0.her} peers.
{0.SimFirstName}’s routine is flawless, if predictable, earning {M0.him}{F0.her} a second place finish. Not bad!
{0.SimFirstName}’s strength and impeccable body awareness allows them to match the flex, and the routine finished flawlessly!  First Prize!
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t quite sure how it happened, but {M0.he}{F0.she} ended up with their arms tied in a tidy knot around their left shin.  The judges are concerned, but not impressed.
{0.SimFirstName}, a professional lifter, easily bests the cocky hobbyist. Still, deadlifting that much wasn't supposed to be part of today’s routine. {0.SimFirstName} feels sore.
There’s no need to humor this amateur.  {0.SimFirstName} is above such childishness!
After a precarious bobble, the Sim gets the bar under control and completes the set. However, {0.SimFirstName}’s boss questions {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to let someone lift so much without a spotter! 
{0.SimFirstName} rushes to help, but the lifter is very aggravated at being interrupted and yells at {0.SimFirstName}.  However, {0.SimFirstName}’s boss steps in and reminds the Sim that it’s NEVER a good idea to lift without a spotter.
{0.SimFirstName} gives them the benefit of the doubt this time, but if it happens again...
{0.SimFirstName} strides up to the perspirer and asks them to clean up their mess.  They are apologetic and quickly rectify the situation with a towel and some sanitizer.
The sweater denies any and all wrong doing, and lodges a complaint. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't get in any real trouble, but dealing with  paperwork causes them to fall behind in their efforts.
It was probably too heavy, but now {0.SimFirstName} will never know for sure.
{0.SimFirstName} lifts the heavy thing! Radical!
{0.SimFirstName} can’t lift the heavy thing! It’s too heavy! How disappointing.
{0.SimFirstName} readies all {M0.his}{F0.her} might before diving directly at Tiny. Tiny swiftly steps to the side, laughing as {0.SimFirstName} makes painful contact with the ground. Tiny takes hold of the shake and proceeds to drink it slowly. Never breaking eye contact with {0.SimFirstName} until the very last drop.
{0.SimFirstName} gets the jump. Deftly shoving Tiny aside before rushing to the bench. {0.SimFirstName} jumps onto the bench and bellows in glory before downing the shake in victory.
{0.SimFirstName} leaps into action, promptly stepping on Tiny's foot and causing both athletes to hit the ground face first. From their new vantage point, the pair watches as the rookie strolls slowly up to the bench and grabs the shake.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to stay out of it. If someone wants to try to play on a hurt leg, that’s their prerogative.
{0.SimFirstName} explains the situation, and the trainer orders some tests. The player had a partially torn ligament, and {0.SimFirstName} may have saved someone a potentially career ending injury!
{0.SimFirstName} explains the situation, and the trainer orders some tests. The player has to miss the big game to be tested, and the team loses in an embarrassing blowout!  
{0.SimFirstName} quickly gathers {M0.his}{F0.her} things and heads out. Coach probably wanted to be left alone anyway. Despite being delicious, the meal is rather uneventful.
{0.SimFirstName} bursts into a crazed gorilla impression, beating {M0.his}{F0.her} chest and ook-ing loudly. After a moment of stunned silence, Coach erupts into laughter at the sheer absurdity of the situation. {0.SimFirstName} asks Coach to join for dinner and he happily accepts.
{0.SimFirstName} approaches the office and starts firing off one-liners at Coach so fast he can barely react. Coach blinks a few times before quietly asking {0.SimFirstName} to leave him alone and then shuts the door.
{0.SimFirstName} walks in and stands defiantly next to the rookie. Not a good call. Looks like the rookie played a prank on the coaching staff and now Coach thinks that {0.SimFirstName} was in on it!
{0.SimFirstName} slowly backs away. The rookie's a talented player, but {0.SimFirstName} has no idea what they might be in trouble for. Better safe than sorry.
The fans get ready, anticipating some major moves after that big play... and are met by boring mediocrity. An awkward silence hangs in the air as the moment passes.
A big play deserves a big celebration! {0.SimFirstName} delivers and the crowd goes wild! {0.SimFirstName} is making sure {M0.his}{F0.her} teammates and coaches know who the big Sim on campus is.
Up. Over. Under. Left. Right. Down...on the ground. Probably should have practiced the routine at least once first!
{0.SimFirstName} is distracted by {M0.his}{F0.her} uniform for the whole game, especially on the 3 or 4 occasions {M0.his}{F0.her} pants fall down. {0.SimFirstName} has an ineffective performance.
The league fines {0.SimFirstName} for a non-compliant uniform, but {M0.he}{F0.she} is feeling so comfortable that {M0.he}{F0.she} has the game of {M0.his}{F0.her} life!
Sure, the financial reward isn’t there, but {0.SimFirstName} decides to do what is best for their sport.
Though some of {0.SimFirstName}’s teammates disagree with the decision, {0.SimFirstName} decides if you’re going to do a commercial, you might as well get paid for it!
The front office realizes {0.SimFirstName} can’t be undersold, and offers a sizable signing bonus!
The front office refuses to budge, and questions how much of a team player {0.SimFirstName} really is…
{0.SimFirstName} decides the current pay is fine, and recommits to the same structured deal as before.
“{0.SimFirstName} takes the safe route and ties the game up as time expires.  A conservative play for sure,  as it really looked like they could have stepped up and won it!”
“The kick is up…  looks a bit wobbly! But it’s off the backboard, squeaks just through the uprights, and it’s into the pool! {M0.he}{F0.she}’s done it! Amazing shot by {0.SimFirstName}!”
“The kick is up… looks a bit wobbly! It’s hooking far, far off of the fairway and headed towards the penalty box. No good! An audacious effort by {0.SimFirstName} loses the game!”
The coach rattles off the usual litany of clichés and idioms. It isn't very effective this time.
Ever charismatic, {0.SimFirstName} ad-libs an inspiring speech rivaling the works of Shakespeare… minus the tragedy. The team rallies and wins! 
{0.SimFirstName} fumbles through words, strained metaphors, and a weird tangent about cake that seemed relevant at the time.  The team is even more befuddled than before.
Cheating is never a good idea. {0.SimFirstName} takes the high road and leaves the book where it is.
{0.SimFirstName} now knows everything that will be coming their way!  With this advantage, they lead their team to victory.  All’s fair in love and sports.
{0.SimFirstName} now knows everything that will be coming their way… or so they think. The other team runs none of the plays from the book, and outsmarts {0.SimFirstName}'s team repeatedly. The book must have been a dummy!
{0.SimFirstName} slogs through the game, but never quite feels like {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. All in all, it’s a pretty mediocre effort.
The Trainer says it’s just tightness and provides a deep-tissue massage. {0.SimFirstName} feels great and has a spectacular performance in a winning effort!
The Trainer feels playing the game would be a poor choice, and makes {0.SimFirstName} sit.  The team loses.  Still, better than suffering a worse injury!
{0.SimFirstName} has been sent to daycare.
{0.SimFirstNameList} have been sent to daycare. They're in good hands!
{0.SimFirstName} has returned from daycare!
{0.SimFirstNameList} have returned from daycare.

{0.SimFirstName} has learned that {1.SimFirstName} is retired.
I'm pretty happy. I was recently nominated employee of the month!
I can't wait for my next promotion. That comes with &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; scythes!
I sure do enjoy the grim prospects.
I like it a lot here. The benefits are killer!
Let me know if you're interested in our customer referral program.
Ah, I'm busy to no end. With all these pools being built, I've been drowning in paperwork.
What? I'm the Grim Reaper!
It's going so-so. My customer fidelity program isn't really taking off.
Are you at all interested in my 2-for-1 deal?
I hate carrots. Don't ever talk to me about carrots. But I do love my job.
My employee badge picture is very unflattering. I'll have to have a new one taken.
You'll find out soon enough.
Oh, you'll find out soon enough-- wait! I've said too much.
My job requires a lot of traveling, but getting through airport security is getting increasingly more annoying.
I can't remember the last time I had some time off. People can be so self-centered sometimes.
This is really more of a hobby. Most of the time, you'll find me on the forums.
You know what they say: if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. Or after-life.
I wish we had Casual Fridays. My jeans are gathering quite a bit of dust.

&lt;i&gt;Coco loco, aplacando esta sed que me abraza, coco loco, que un buen rato contigo se pasa.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nCoquito is a traditional Christmas Holiday drink from Puerto Rico and some say it can be called the Puerto Rican Eggnog. Coquito is served usually after dinner and in a small glass and its taste is sweet and strong. If you are brave enough feel free to add Eggs - personally it is ok without.\n\nMany families have their own variations that are passed down through generations, but we hope your Sims enjoy this simified virgin rendition of this drink as prepared by our wonderful Sim Mixologists.
Make Coquito
Coquito
Considered often the National Drink of Brazil. This is a very refreshing and simple to make option to enjoy any festivity. According to historians, it was invented by landowning farmers in the region of Piracicaba, interior of the State of São Paulo, during the 19th century as a local drink for 'high standard' events and parties, a reflection of the strong sugarcane culture in the region.\n\nWe hope your Sims enjoy this simified virgin rendition of this drink as prepared by our wonderful Sim Mixologists.

Wait For Carrier
Excited Fan
A fan recognizes {0.SimFirstName} at the supermarket and says hello…and then asks for an autograph, a picture, and starts an in-depth discussion about {M0.his}{F0.her} latest bestseller. {0.SimFirstName}’s flattered, but {M0.he}{F0.she} really just wants to buy {M0.his}{F0.her} groceries and go. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either be friendly to the excited fan, or make a quick exit.
Breaking News
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss asks {0.SimPronounObjective} to drop everything and watch for a possible breaking news story…but they're really really busy. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} focus in like {0.SimFirstName}'s supposed to, or just go about {M0.his}{F0.her} day and hope {M0.he}{F0.she} catches it when it happens?
Boring News
{0.SimFirstName} is SO BORED covering the local news. Are the readers as bored as {M0.he}{F0.she} is? {0.SimFirstName} can either start adding sensational details to make this stuff seem juicier, or stick to {M0.his}{F0.her} just-the-facts reporting.
Unimpressive Resume
{M0.His}{F0.Her} resume isn’t very impressive yet, but {0.SimFirstName} wants {M0.his}{F0.her} career to move a little faster. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} just be honest about not having much experience, or punch up {M0.his}{F0.her} resume with some things that aren’t totally 100% technically true?
Late Payment
{0.SimFirstName}’s discovered the hardest part of being a freelancer-getting paid on time. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either hound the company for the money, or just move on and not waste any more time that could be used working.
Spelling Error
In the rush to make {M0.his}{F0.her} deadline, {0.SimFirstName} accidentally made a dumb spelling error, and now it’s in print. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} fess up to {M0.his}{F0.her} mistake, or just blame the proofreader?
Crazy Letter
This crazy letter has to be a joke…right? {0.SimFirstName}’s pretty sure {M0.he}{F0.she}’s getting played by an internet jokester, but there’s no way to know for sure. If {M0.he}{F0.she} publishes the letter, it’ll be {M0.his}{F0.her} most famous column ever-or {M0.he}{F0.she} could just ignore it to be safe.
Pass the Buck
Report the Bugs
How noble! {0.SimFirstName} alerts the competition, and the developers are able to provide a build without the exploit in it. It turns out that {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent was secretly counting on the exploit to win, and without it {0.SimFirstName} wins easily.
{0.SimFirstName} tosses the job to {M0.his}{F0.her} co-worker like a hot potato. It’s a nice thought until {M0.his}{F0.her} boss catches on. After a rather long speech about challenge, opportunity and the QA mindset, {0.SimFirstName} is sent back to orientation.
Just as {0.SimFirstName} thought, {M0.his}{F0.her} Co-worker is thrilled at the opportunity to show off his bug-crushing prowess, setting aside hours to catalog the last detail of every bug. Win for him, and win for {0.SimFirstName}, who would rather be doing not that.

Success! {0.SimFirstName} totally crushes {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent, wowing the crowd. The studio will almost certainly remove the exploit now, but everyone sees {0.SimFirstName}'s use of it as strategic. They start calling it &quot;{0.SimFirstName}'s Gambit.&quot;
Ouch! It doesn't take long for the crowd to discover {0.SimFirstName}'s use of the exploit, and they do not like it. The officials actually stop the game for unsportsmanlike play, and ban the 'sploit. Without {M0.his}{F0.her} one weird trick, {0.SimFirstName} is easily beaten by {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent, much to the crowd's delight.
Engage the Investor
Continue the Pitch
{0.SimFirstName} has been invited to speak on a panel at a local industry event. But when the moderator introduces {0.SimPronounObjective}, she messes up {0.SimFirstName}’s name and the name of {M0.his}{F0.her} former company. {0.SimFirstName} can either correct her, or let it slide.
{0.SimFirstName} sees that the next customer in the chat queue is an old flame of {M0.his}{F0.hers}, and things didn’t exactly end prettily. The other agents are tied up. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} respond to the chat request or pretend not to notice?
The CFO at {0.SimFirstName}’s company is embroiled in a huge, public WooHoo scandal, and reporters accuse him of using company funds to pay for inappropriate services. {0.SimFirstName} can try to defuse the situation by brushing off the accusations, or agree to investigate {M0.his}{F0.her} colleague’s records.
Bug Reports
{0.SimFirstName} has just noticed a section of software that is riddled with bugs. {M0.He}{F0.She} can buckle down and report them all by {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, or convince {M0.his}{F0.her} zealous Co-worker to do it.
A co-worker is on hour 17, energy drink 24, and it’s starting to get ripe in the QA pit. Seeing as no one is going home anytime soon, {0.SimFirstName} can play this two ways: whip out the {M0.men’s body spray}{F0.lavender air freshener} or tell Foul Boy next to {M0.him}{F0.her} to go wash up.
{0.SimFirstName} is invited to demo an up-and-coming game at its launch party. By the time the game’s unveiled, {M0.he}{F0.she} is feeling a little dazed from all the socializing, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been smack-talking with other pros for hours. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} step up to the plate, or call it early and get some much needed rest?
At last! {0.SimFirstName} has presented {M0.his}{F0.her} very own idea for a game and the CEO is interested. The hitch is that he wants to make a few changes to the concept that will make it kind of…suck. {0.SimFirstName} can charge forward with the project anyway and hope to save it as {M0.he}{F0.she} goes, or pitch it to a different studio.
Some button masher has made it into {0.SimFirstName}’s online game lobby, and his relentless stream of insults is kind of wrecking everything. How’s a pro supposed to practice with all this racket-and poor playing? Does {0.SimFirstName} mute the offender and tough it out, or try to boot the jerk?
The pool table seemed like a good idea. It had always been {0.SimFirstName}’s fantasy: to build a company with a pool table. But now {M0.his}{F0.her} team is spending a little too much time in the rec room and not enough at their desks. {0.SimFirstName} can either sell it off, or lay down the law with {M0.his}{F0.her} employees.
{0.SimFirstName} is pitching {M0.his}{F0.her} Next Big Idea when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices that the key partner in the investment firm is messing around on his phone. {M0.He}{F0.She} can ignore it and continue {M0.his}{F0.her} pitch, or try to engage the investor with a question.
{0.SimFirstName} is slinging code like a rockstar when {M0.he}{F0.she} is suddenly transferred into a position {M0.he}{F0.she} has no experience with. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} speak up and ask for training, or wing it with the book they gave {M0.him}{F0.her}?
{0.SimFirstName} is signed up for a high-profile multiplayer competition with a team handpicked by the sponsor. Trouble is, one of their guys is all marketing and no game, and {0.SimFirstName} is sure he will cost them the win. {M0.He}{F0.She} can raise the issue with the sponsor, or let the player do himself in.
Buyout Offer
A rival company contacts {0.SimFirstName} privately with an offer to buy {M0.his}{F0.her} new feather-light speaker. {0.SimFirstName} can sell out and take the cash, or stand by {M0.his}{F0.her} product and hope it's successful.
Under Pressure
{0.SimFirstName}'s new project is already falling behind schedule. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} insist that everyone work late, or try to persuade {M0.his}{F0.her} boss that {M0.he}{F0.she} needs more time?
{0.SimFirstName} is priming for an important tournament when the motherboard on {M0.his}{F0.her} rig burns out. With only a little time left, {M0.he}{F0.she} has to choose between trying to fix it quickly or using one of the competition’s machines instead.
{0.SimFirstName} notices everyone grinning and laughing, but chat windows disappear when {M0.he}{F0.she} comes around. {M0.He}{F0.She} can pretend not to notice or confront {M0.his}{F0.her} team.
{0.SimFirstName}’s producer has started sending panicked emails to {M0.him}{F0.her} several times a day. It’s hard to get any work done when {M0.he}{F0.she} has to keep handling every one of these little “emergencies.” {0.SimFirstName} can either ignore the emails, or research a larger solution that will solve all the producer’s problems.
Investor Update
{0.SimFirstName}'s first investors are nearly as enthusiastic as {M0.he}{F0.she} is, which would be great, if they weren't always asking for status updates. Now the investors are asking again and the status is, well, not good. Does {0.SimFirstName} lie and assure them that it's fine, or come clean?
A Chance to Cheat!
In {M0.his}{F0.her} final hours of training before a match, {0.SimFirstName} finds a previously undiscovered exploit in the competition build of the game. {M0.He}{F0.She} can try to use it to {M0.his}{F0.her} advantage during the match, or let everyone know.
{0.SimFirstName}’s assistant has booked {0.SimPronounObjective} to give the keynote at a prominent executives-only event right during {M0.his}{F0.her} annual {M0.men’s}{F0.women’s} ski day. {0.SimFirstName} can keep the speaking engagement, or invent a more dire conflict.
A Tempting Sum
Getting famous is fun, but it can have its downsides. Like when a competitor offers {0.SimFirstName} a bribe to throw the next game. It's hard not to feel a little honored--and the bribe is substantial... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the cash or refuse?
{0.SimFirstName} is supposed to demo at the Game Developers Showcase, but breaks {M0.his}{F0.her} smartphone bungee-jumping at another game’s booth. {M0.He}{F0.She} could try to find a show associate and ask when {M0.his}{F0.her} shift starts, or use the excuse to skip work and be one of the first to play WAR MEADOW 6.
Sloppy Code
{0.SimFirstName} notices that {M0.his}{F0.her} new Co-worker has introduced a huge bug. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} tell their feature producer, or keep quiet and try to fix it for him?
{0.SimFirstName} gets unofficial word that a competitor is coming out with a product nearly identical to the one {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} tasked with developing. {M0.He}{F0.She} can alert upper management or hang tight and hope the competitor falls on its face.
The Needs of the Few
{0.SimFirstName}'s company has just launched an exciting re-design of their most popular software. Unfortunately a small but vocal minority of users are complaining about it. Should {0.SimFirstName} risk changing it again to appease them, or ignore the complaints?
Customer Satisfaction
An irate customer contacts {0.SimFirstName} demanding a refund on her new smartphone. {M0.He}{F0.She} could just give the customer a refund and get back to the game {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} been playing, or try to calm her down and talk her through the problem.
{0.SimFirstName} is tearing it up at a local tournament when a random mascot from a different game starts hovering over {M0.him}{F0.her}. The green fur is distracting enough, but when the mascot starts leading the crowd in raucous cheers, {0.SimFirstName} is faced with a tough decision: embrace the attention, or send the furball packing.
Endorsement Deal
A certain deodorant company is offering {0.SimFirstName} cash to promote their latest product at {M0.his}{F0.her} next event. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn't have to do much...just wear a heat-mapping t-shirt that highlights {M0.his}{F0.her} pits and give a short plug on how it helps {0.SimPronounObjective} stay cool. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} take the cash deal, or pass? 
{0.SimFirstName} knows the rival wouldn't make an offer if they didn't have a cause for concern. Before {M0.he}{F0.she} knows it, they have desperately tripled their offer! Now {0.SimFirstName} knows that {M0.his}{F0.her} idea is going to be a huge success, and it's staying right there with {0.SimPronounObjective}.
Well, hindsight is always 20-20. Another rival announces its own ultralight speaker, and all of {0.SimFirstName}'s offers mysteriously vanish. Worse, the rival speaker will hit the market well before {M0.his}{F0.her} model is ready.
{0.SimFirstName} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} nose clean and {M0.his}{F0.her} head held high, and feels pretty awesome for it. {M0.His}{F0.Her} newfound confidence helps {0.SimPronounObjective} crush the match, qualifying {0.SimPronounObjective} for the next tournament.
Wing It
Speak Up
Wait It Out
Speak Up
Phew! The schedule is back on track and upper management is pleased. {0.SimFirstName}'s team is complaining pretty loudly, but at least this time they have a reason!
Sell Off the Product
Keep the Product
It works! The producer commends {0.SimFirstName}, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} has a favor in the bank with the new guy. That could come in handy!
Well, it was gracious of {0.SimFirstName} to try, but all {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to do is make the bug worse. Now everyone notices the bug and blames {M0.him}{F0.her}! Strangely enough, the new Co-worker stays quiet as a mouse while the producer gives {0.SimFirstName} an earful.
Praise is rare around here, but {0.SimFirstName} has earned a feather in {M0.his}{F0.her} cap, at least with {M0.his}{F0.her} producer. The Co-worker, on the other hand, yells at {0.SimFirstName} for making him look bad and then falls into a rather vengeful silence.
HA HA HA HA!! More time! That's hilarious. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} for a good laugh and dismisses {M0.him}{F0.her}. Well, here's hoping the dev team likes pizza! Every night. For the next eight weeks.
{0.SimFirstName}'s manager thanks {0.SimPronounObjective} for bringing this matter to his attention and gives the team more time. {0.SimFirstName} comes out a hero to both upper management and {M0.his}{F0.her} underlings.
Can't please everybody, and what is it that the haters are gonna do? Oh, right: hate. {0.SimFirstName} stands behind the re-design, and online orders of the software exceed the previous version's by 35 percent!
What great service! The customer is delighted that {0.SimFirstName}’s company is so gracious about refunds and departs happily to post all about it.
Investors appreciate honesty, and products get delayed all the time. {0.SimFirstName} carries on with development as planned.
Sponsors pay, but {0.SimFirstName} needs to show some self-respect! {M0.His}{F0.Her} fans react horribly to the marketing stunt, trashing {0.SimPronounObjective} in the forums. But at least the money's good.
The stunt is a little outrageous, but no one really expects anything less. After all, {0.SimFirstName} is the {M0.guy}{F0.girl} who gets paid to game. No one cares who's paying! They just want to see the main event!
Crack the Whip
Argue for Time
Fix It
Ditch It
Ask What's Up
Ignore the Behavior
The users have actually identified some design flaws that no one picked up in testing. Everyone loves the simple improvements, and sales go up.
The haters love the changes--and the fact that the company listened--but now the vast majority of users are complaining that it was better before. Orders of the software suffer.
Whoops. {0.SimFirstName}'s investors turn out to be a lot more seasoned than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. They see through the act and promptly pull out. Back to pounding the pavement...
{0.SimFirstName}'s political savvy is paying off! Mystified by the expert-sounding technical jargon {M0.he}{F0.she} sprinkles throughout the update, the investors believe {M0.him}{F0.her} and invest even more.

Amazing! In a surprise move, {0.SimFirstName} talks the customer through her problems and appeases her without refunding a single Simoleon. {0.SimFirstName}’s boss is so impressed that he begins transferring more “challenging” customers {M0.his}{F0.her} way.
{0.SimFirstName} should have learned by now that this kind of customer is just looking for a target, and {M0.his}{F0.her} backside may as well have red and white circles on it. Now even more furious, the customer demands to speak to {0.SimFirstName}’s manager.

{0.SimFirstName} refuses to sell out and {M0.his}{F0.her} fans love {0.SimPronounObjective} for it, talking {0.SimPronounObjective} up in all the circles that matter to a gaming pro. No money this time but the investment in reputation will pay off, {0.SimFirstName} is sure of it.
Alert Upper Management
Ignore the Complaints
Appease the Haters
What a star! {0.SimFirstName} is top of the QA team and {M0.his}{F0.her} dedication does not go unrewarded. {M0.His}{F0.Her} co-worker is a bit miffed to have missed all the fun and glory, but he’s taking it out on a dog toy that he thinks is a stress ball.

Turns out taking a bribe is hard! Losing a game convincingly is even harder than winning a game legitimately! {0.SimFirstName} fumbles it so badly that the crowd is immediately suspicious. The officials promise a follow-up investigation and {0.SimFirstName}'s competitor refuses to pay!
Turns out taking a bribe is hard! Losing a game convincingly is even harder than winning a game legitimately! But {0.SimFirstName} pulls it off and gets the cash.

The teacher decides to provide {0.SimFirstName} with a little life lesson. (Isn’t it great when they do that?) {0.SimFirstName} learns that if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants a better grade, {M0.he}{F0.she} should study harder first instead of cry about it after.
The teacher is still not back by the end of class, so it doesn’t matter that {0.SimFirstName} started {M0.his}{F0.her} other homework first. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} just do {M0.his}{F0.her} reading at home later.
The truth is that the material is hard, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t always feel compelled to try harder. The guidance counselor’s a little surprised at the honesty, but grateful that the issue isn’t something more severe. 
So trusting, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are. {M0.He}{F0.She} picks an unlocked locker and snatches a lunch. Someone’s mom has a lot of time on her hands, because this is a feast!
All it takes is a few answers to make sure that {0.SimFirstName}’s friend passes. Now {M0.his}{F0.her} friend owes {0.SimPronounObjective} a gigantic favor—not a bad position to be in!
{0.SimFirstName} paints such a bleak picture of {M0.his}{F0.her} home life that the counselor insists on talking to {M0.his}{F0.her} parents about {M0.his}{F0.her} living conditions. Uh-oh. 
All {0.SimFirstName} has to do is walk around the lunchroom and {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are happy to share whatever they don’t want. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets so much food, {M0.he}{F0.she} might just forget {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch every day!
All high-achievers take the test at least twice—some five or six times. {0.SimFirstName} is confident {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} get the result {M0.he}{F0.she} wants eventually! 
{0.SimFirstName} is so slammed trying to study for another round of testing while finishing {M0.his}{F0.her} regular schoolwork, that {M0.he}{F0.she} has trouble concentrating. {M0.His}{F0.Her} next test score is even lower!
The other kids agree that they should just do it, but when it comes time for grades, the teacher can tell that {0.SimFirstName} hasn’t been pulling {M0.his}{F0.her} weight. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a grade lower than the rest of the group.
It takes a fair amount of self-control, but ignoring the bullies works. Eventually they get bored and move on to a different target. {0.SimFirstName} feels a little bad for that other kid, but hey, school is a jungle sometimes!
{0.SimFirstName} spends so much time trying to figure out answers that {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves half the bubbles unfilled. {M0.He}{F0.She} would have done better just to take the random guesses.
How about that! {0.SimFirstName} has learned more than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. {M0.He}{F0.She} earns a passing grade on the test.
{M0.His}{F0.Her} presentation blows the other students’ out of the water. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets the highest grade in the class, and the teacher submits {0.SimPronounObjective} for Student of the Millennium.
It’s weird, but things seem to make a little more sense coming from {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates than the teacher. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} actually starting to wrap {M0.his}{F0.her} head around this!
Without {M0.his}{F0.her} notes, the rival is lost…{0.SimFirstName} aces the next few tests and {M0.his}{F0.her} rival has to work twice as hard just to keep up.
{M0.He}{F0.She} made the productive, non-frivolous choice, and {M0.he}{F0.she} got an extra half-hour of study time in. Excellent. This will definitely make a difference, come college application time.
It really is okay to take a short break now and then. {0.SimFirstName}’s brain reaches information overload, and {M0.he}{F0.she} goes back into class feeling more overworked than ever!
Since {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t have to think about the answers, it’s a very quick and stress-free test! {M0.He}{F0.She} spends the extra time daydreaming. 
{M0.He}{F0.She} plucks a sack out of the first unlocked locker {M0.he}{F0.she} sees, but when {0.SimFirstName} opens the bag {M0.he}{F0.she} discovers a half-dissected frog. Gross! Who keeps that in a locker?! Serves {0.SimFirstName} right for being a sneak.
{M0.He}{F0.She} tries to do the reading, but {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t concentrate since {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} thinking about that mountain of homework. At the end of class, {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t even remember what {M0.he}{F0.she} just read.
It’s just too far over {M0.his}{F0.her} head, and {0.SimFirstName} gets a poor grade. Now it’s going to be even harder to get out of this class with a B or higher!
It was going to be a quiet working day anyway, and {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates barely notice the difference. It’s not like {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} lecturing them on the periodic table or anything.
Darn it! {0.SimFirstName}’s tattling actually woke the kid up! By the time the teacher looks over in his direction, he’s sitting straight up, bright-eyed and grinning from ear to ear. The teacher admonishes {0.SimFirstName} for wasting time. 
{0.SimFirstName} skims over the important material before the test. {M0.His}{F0.Her} score ends up being right in the middle of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates’. Coulda been better, coulda been worse. Perfect C student performance.
Although the class has a good time, the teacher springs a pop quiz later, and nobody is prepared. Despite the fun they had, they blame {0.SimFirstName} for this quizaster.
The students run screaming outside, and so many scatter that classes are called off for the rest of the day! {0.SimFirstName} better wrap up that assignment tonight!
{0.SimFirstName} successfully pushes the drone of snoring out of his mind so {M0.he}{F0.she} can focus on the drone of the teacher’s voice. No problem!
Not only did {0.SimFirstName} manage to score a few extra points toward {M0.his}{F0.her} final grade, the extra practice actually helped {0.SimPronounObjective} understand the material better!
{0.SimFirstName} is able to manage a good grade on the difficult test, but the answers for the easy test didn’t come quite as easy as {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} hoped. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a B+ and a C-. Rats.
{0.SimFirstName} is just thinking about how {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not going to think about the snoring anymore when the teacher suddenly calls on {M0.him}{F0.her}. Wait, what was the question? Um... The other students laugh while {0.SimFirstName} wonders how {M0.HE’S}{F0.SHE’S} the one who gets in trouble!
Turns out that pulling the fire alarm is mildly illegal. For the foreseeable future, {0.SimFirstName}’s free study time will now be detention time. And {M0.he}{F0.she} still got a zero on the assignment.
{0.SimFirstName}’s best educated guess turns out to be right! And the final grade on the test isn’t that bad. {M0.He}{F0.She} might just be getting the hang of this!
{0.SimFirstName} lifts a few answers, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} test back, it turns out the other student was clueless, too. {M0.He}{F0.She} didn’t get caught, but {M0.he}{F0.she} still fails the test. Thanks for nothing, kid!
{0.SimFirstName}'s all caught up on {M0.his}{F0.her} sleep for the day. And if the teacher noticed she didn’t care, at least not enough to interrupt movie day. 
{0.SimFirstName} studies and practices like mad, and greatly improves {M0.his}{F0.her} grade on today’s test! It turns out {M0.his}{F0.her} reward was directly proportional to {M0.his}{F0.her} effort!
{0.SimFirstName} focuses hard and reviews ALL of the material—and it pays off big time. {M0.He}{F0.She} scores higher on the test than anyone else in the class. The teacher congratulates {M0.him}{F0.her} on a job well done!
The test was harder than {0.SimFirstName} thought it would be, and {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t know many of the answers. {M0.He}{F0.She} squeaks out a pass, but now {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll have to work extra hard in the class.
{0.SimFirstName} stands {M0.his}{F0.her} ground. {M0.He}{F0.She} can’t risk {M0.his}{F0.her} own grade, after all! The friend doesn’t like that, swearing never to help {0.SimFirstName} ever again.
Who says a formal education doesn’t pay off? By the end of the day {0.SimFirstName} will leave this school a little wiser and a little richer!
What good is a study group? A book’s a book, no matter how many people are there when you read it. Can a study group teach you street smarts?? That’s what {0.SimFirstName} wants to know.
Losing those notes makes the rival fall so far behind, {M0.he}{F0.she} comes to {0.SimFirstName} for help because “everyone knows {0.SimFirstName} is the smartest.” {0.SimFirstName} feels so guilty {M0.he}{F0.she} winds up tutoring {M0.his}{F0.her} rival during study time.
The other student seems to know his stuff! His answer makes perfect sense. {0.SimFirstName} should sit next to him in every class. Hey, maybe this is one of those alternative learning styles {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} heard about!

Distracting Napper
One of the students in the back of {0.SimFirstName}’s class has started to snore quietly. The teacher doesn’t seem to hear it but it’s getting distracting. Should {0.SimFirstName} just try harder to ignore it? Or should {M0.he}{F0.she} tell the teacher?
Stressed Teacher
The teacher has to run out and pick up his medication, so he asks the class to sit quietly and do their reading assignment while he’s gone. Should {0.SimFirstName} do that, or try to do some other homework while {M0.he}{F0.she} has the chance? 
Forgotten Lunch
{0.SimFirstName} forgot {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch today. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} out wandering the halls between classes, so {M0.he}{F0.she} could easily steal someone else’s out of their locker. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do that, or just go hungry? 
Whoops! The client notices the similarities between the jingles, and so does everyone else. {0.SimFirstName} tries to play it like a deliberate spoof, but that only makes things worse. Luckily, the deodorant company agrees to drop their lawsuit once {M0.his}{F0.her} jingle is pulled from the air.
Everyone enjoyed {0.SimFirstName}’s set, but a couple of the judges are insisting that the gross-out act was the be-all and end-all of comedy. Ultimately they just flip a coin to determine the winner, but {0.SimFirstName} wins the toss!
Luckily the piano is somewhat concealed by two stately ferns and an elegantly sweeping staircase. Despite difficulty breathing and a steady pain in {M0. his gut}{F0.her ribs} {0.SimFirstName} plays moderately well and goes utterly unnoticed.
{0.SimFirstName} should have known that the world wasn’t ready for a cocky cauliflower. {M0.He}{F0.She} is rapidly replaced by a tamer vegetable, who knows {M0.his}{F0.her} place in the food chain.
Uh-oh. Mr. Funny Guy isn’t done. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} already has the crowd in {M0.his}{F0.her} back pocket! After one more try, the heckler leaves and {0.SimFirstName} rocks the mic.

{0.SimFirstName} decides to take a job as a performer at a child’s birthday party. How hard can it be? When the child asks {M0.him}{F0.her} to juggle, though, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not sure {M0.he}{F0.she} remembers how. {M0.He}{F0.She} can try it-not much looks breakable in here-or try to distract the child.
{0.SimFirstName} has been practicing and practicing a section of a score and just can't quite get it right. It is more than a little frustrating. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} keep at it, or take a break?
{0.SimFirstName} hopes to make some extra cash on the side by teaching piano to neighborhood kids, but {M0.his}{F0.her} very first student spills soda all over the piano keys. {M0.He}{F0.She} can tell the little barbarian to come back next week, once it’s fixed, or charge the mother for cleaning and repair.
Hired to play piano for a private black-tie event, {0.SimFirstName} forgets to pick up {M0.a tux}{F0.an evening gown} at the rental shop. With no time left and limited options, {M0.he}{F0.she} can either borrow one that’s a little tight or dress down and hope no one notices.
While performing at a private party, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly draws a complete blank. What’s the next line? {M0.He}{F0.She} can improvise or just stop and save some face.
After a regular gig at a comedy club, {0.SimFirstName} notices {M0.his}{F0.her} paycheck is a little light. {M0.He}{F0.She} can go confront the owner right now, or hang tight until {M0.his}{F0.her} second set later on.
{0.SimFirstName} knew it wasn’t a great idea to start {M0.his}{F0.her} comedy set so late. The crowd is getting rowdy, and {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} losing control fast. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either yell to get their attention or give up and shut it down.
It isn’t easy to find piano bars these days, but {0.SimFirstName} is lucky like that. {M0.His}{F0.Her} sad, sweet melodies have everyone feeling all right, until a former favorite comes back and reclaims the bench for himself. {0.SimFirstName} can play this two ways: offer to let him play a set, or tell him to move along.
{0.SimFirstName}’s power-drill jingle is just about to air when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a women’s deodorant commercial is using a very similar tune. What’s worse, {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t remember whether {M0.he}{F0.she} heard it before or after {M0.he}{F0.she} wrote {M0.his}{F0.her} jingle. {0.SimFirstName} can alert {M0.his}{F0.her} client, or hope that no one notices.
{0.SimFirstName} is at a friend’s birthday party when all falls quiet. To liven things up {M0.he}{F0.she} tries out a few gags from {M0.his}{F0.her} latest routine, but is not getting any reaction from the guests. {M0.He}{F0.She} can dial it up, or shut it down.
Uh oh. {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is double-booked to play at a starlet’s private party and a charity event for third-world hunger. The good cause could give {M0.him}{F0.her} an out, but the starlet is known for her temper … and killer parties.
{0.SimFirstName} is asked to collaborate on the script for the Music Awards, to help the MC, but the final script doesn’t include any of {0.SimFirstName}’s jokes. {M0.He}{F0.She} could say nothing and settle for a nice check, or go to bat for a few of {M0.his}{F0.her} better gags.
Toward the end of a luxurious launch party, {0.SimFirstName} runs out of material. {M0.He}{F0.She} could easily repeat a few numbers without anyone taking notice, or use the opportunity to try out a classical world rock fusion ballad {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been composing.
At a joke-off, another comic goes for potty humor. {0.SimFirstName} can sink to his level, or try to rise above the stink and keep it clean.
{0.SimFirstName} has created the best kitty litter jingle ever! But when {M0.he}{F0.she} pitches it to {M0.his}{F0.her} client, the VP of Dumbing Things Down asks {0.SimPronounObjective} to work in the word “piddle” based on recent market research. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} make the change, or fight for {M0.his}{F0.her} art?
Uh oh. {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is double-booked for a friend’s party, which {M0.he}{F0.she} agreed to do for free, and a high-paying corporate event. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} give up the paycheck and help {M0.his}{F0.her} friend’s party, or do the corporate event and bail on {M0.his}{F0.her} friend?
{0.SimFirstName} has been invited to give the toast at {M0.his}{F0.her} best friend’s wedding. At last, a captive audience! Does {M0.he}{F0.she} play it safe and keep the friend’s skeletons in the closet, or bare all in the hopes of a good laugh and maybe even a gig?
{0.SimFirstName} has just won over the crowd at a local event when some attention-hog gets jealous and starts heckling {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} can play it two ways-take Mr. Funny Guy head on, or repay his insults with silence.
Regular gigs are great, and so are regular fans. Until {0.SimFirstName}’s fans get a bit unruly. When a {M0.gaggle of table-dancing girls breaks}{F0. sweaty moshpit of men break} 3 different tables on 3 different nights, the club manager tells {0.SimFirstName} to get it under control or get off the stage. Will {M0.he}{F0.she} confront {M0.his}{F0.her} fans or take the party elsewhere?
{0.SimFirstName} has stumbled upon an Open Mic night at a local coffeehouse. Might be a good chance to brush up on {M0.his}{F0.her} guitar skills! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} win over the crowd with a couple of well-loved cover songs or play some original material instead?
{0.SimFirstName} has attained the honor of performing with one of the most celebrated cellists of all time-who is also a great musical influence. But while they are practicing, {0.SimFirstName} hears a part he seems to be playing incorrectly. {M0.He}{F0.She} can point it out or trust that the maestro knows what he’s doing.
{0.SimFirstName} is MCing a special press party for a new product launch. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} on fire, roasting the competition, when {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been bashing the wrong company. {M0.He}{F0.She} can play it off like {M0.he}{F0.she} knew {M0.his}{F0.her} mistake all along, or make a quick exit and hope people forget the gaff.
What’s scarier than Mozart’s darkest symphonies? A bride who doesn’t get her way. Or at least, the bride who is standing over {0.SimFirstName} screaming about a “playlist” of classical music {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to prepare. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either apologize for the mistake or remind the bride that she never sent it.
{0.SimFirstName} enters a comedy contest, but just before {M0.he}{F0.she} goes on, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that the person before {0.SimPronounObjective} is using jokes from {M0.his}{F0.her} set. Should {0.SimFirstName} call him on it when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the mic, or come up with something new fast?
At last! {0.SimFirstName} has found a real gig! Well, okay, it’s amateur night and pretty much anyone with a pulse can perform, but {0.SimFirstName} is officially on the list. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} invite friends, or consider this a private test run?
With just a few keystrokes, {0.SimFirstName} calculates a new course and punches in the coordinates. {M0.He}{F0.She} flies well clear of the asteroids and even catches a nice glimpse of the Northern Lights. 
{M0.He}{F0.She} disengages the fuel lock and dumps thousands of gallons of propellant into space. Then the senior officer takes the stick and they head for the nearest space garage.
There’s a minor altercation outside the venue where a fan gets a little handsy with the singer. She’s okay, but her handlers raise such a stink with the Star Council that {0.SimFirstName} gets blamed for it. 
{M0.His}{F0.Her} grade isn’t great, but {0.SimFirstName} squeaks out a pass…just barely.
Turns out the astronauts took the shuttle on an unapproved joyride, and they all get fired. Although {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t like feeling like a snitch, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss takes note of {M0.his}{F0.her} attention to detail. Also, those astronauts were kind of jerks anyway.
None of the boys had any contraband. In fact, they were studying for a big exam. This is exactly why the Planet Patrol is not very popular in this sector. {0.SimFirstName} is going to deal with the fallout from this for a while...
This reminds {0.SimFirstName} of that old video game about asteroids - it was called SPACE ROCK BLASTERS.  {M0.He}{F0.She} wends {M0.his}{F0.her} way through the asteroid field without getting even a scratch on the shuttle’s paint job.
No good deed goes unpunished - no sooner does {0.SimFirstName} sell out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mid-priced skins than a competitor enters the market, charging triple. He sells out and makes a fortune that could have been {0.SimFirstName}'s.
People are so disgusted and outraged that a citizen’s commission forms in order to deal with the trash situation. They get paid by private donation, so the sheriff’s department saves money, too!
There’s a reason the senior officer is the senior officer: to make these calls. Doesn’t {0.SimFirstName} trust him? He shoves {0.SimFirstName} off the driver’s seat and performs the fuel dump himself, and chews {0.SimFirstName} out the whole way to the space garage.
Nobody cares. Nobody cleans. Nobody changes a darn thing. Eventually, the galaxy is swimming in refuse and {0.SimFirstName}’s got to figure something else out. 
Some space monsters just want to watch the galaxy burn. {0.SimFirstName} is fine stepping into some moral grey areas, but this gangster has no code of conduct at all! Even though it makes {M0.him}{F0.her} look weak, {0.SimFirstName} has to bail on the job.
The crowds are so unruly and uncontrollable that the singer’s private security never could have handled it on their own. {0.SimFirstName}’s deputies help preserve order, and as a thank you, the singer makes a generous donation to {0.SimFirstName}’s department. 
The team delivers beautifully, and they gather tons of useful data for {0.SimFirstName}. They describe new plant and animal species, write down a new alien language, and discover potable water on an alien world.
Word spreads that {0.SimFirstName}'s prices are out of line and soon {M0.his}{F0.her}line of customers dries up. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s single-handedly deflated demand for the product. Soon {M0.he}{F0.she} has to drop {M0.his}{F0.her} prices to lower than market rate, just to get the skins off {M0.his}{F0.her} hands.
{0.SimFirstName} climbs into the pod and launches toward home. {M0.He}{F0.She} watches the ship retreat in {M0.his}{F0.her} rearview mirror, and sees the fire go out on its own. {M0.He}{F0.She} shouldn’t have bailed-now the mission’s a failure and {0.SimFirstName} has no way to recover the shuttle.
{0.SimFirstName} triangulates the origin of the transmission and follows it to the source…an alien ship! {0.SimFirstName} flies the flag of universal peace and makes the first recorded contact with a new race of alien beings. They are very proficient at math and love éclairs. 
The task isn’t too difficult, but {0.SimFirstName}’s team executes flawlessly. The rest of the agency knows that they’re dependable in a pinch.
While {0.SimFirstName}’s deputies are acting as glorified babysitters, smugglers and bandits have the solar system to themselves. You could steal Galactic Hall! The Star Council chides {0.SimFirstName} for leaving the galaxy understaffed.
Between the Endangered Space Species Act and the Carnivorous Plant Weapons Treaty, {0.SimFirstName}’s got enough problems with government regulation. The upside just isn’t worth getting caught. {0.SimFirstName} coughs up the taxes.
The team never quite makes it to the right coordinates, so they see nothing, hear nothing, and discover nothing. They come home empty-handed and {0.SimFirstName}’s got to answer for it. 
{0.SimFirstName} leaves the suspect handcuffed at a Space Gas station. When {M0.he}{F0.she} returns from stopping the hijacking, the suspect is still there, surly as ever. {0.SimFirstName} makes the collar on both cases.
The gangster throws some epic parties and pays so well that {0.SimFirstName} can spend {M0.his}{F0.her} time counting money instead of thinking about ethics.
Rules are there for a reason. Once {M0.he}{F0.she} gets approval to install the system, {M0.he}{F0.she} does. The pilots like it and everyone gives {0.SimFirstName} a polite round of applause. 
{0.SimFirstName} tries to calculate the new course in {M0.his}{F0.her} head, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} types in the new coordinates {M0.he}{F0.she} flies totally off-track. Now {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got to work to bring the ship back into orbit before {M0.he}{F0.she} floats away!
Out of the thousand crates in the warehouse, the customs inspector picks {0.SimFirstName}’s to open…he discovers the tiles and fines {0.SimFirstName} more money than {M0.he}{F0.she} would have spent on taxes in the first place.
Sleep isn’t a substitute for actually knowing the answers. {0.SimFirstName} feels great, but {M0.he}{F0.she} still doesn’t know anything about Space Geography. {M0.He}{F0.She} fails, and it will be a while before {M0.he}{F0.she} can retake the test.
{M0.He}{F0.She} might have gotten a decent grade...if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} stayed awake through the whole exam. But {0.SimFirstName} was so exhausted that {M0.he}{F0.she} fell asleep right at {M0.his}{F0.her} desk. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} has to wait months to take the test again.
Nobody listens to {0.SimFirstName}, and although {M0.he}{F0.she} collects some money in fines, the space jails and star courts are now filling up with litterbugs. The whole thing is becoming more trouble than it’s worth.
Turns out the gangster was looking to clean up his act. Not a lot, of course, just enough to organize and expand his profits. {0.SimFirstName} could have been the one to lead that organization effort. Sounds like it would have been a pretty plush job!
Better to finish the arrest in progress before charging off on another mission. A Flornaxian Fire Bird in the hand, etc... {0.SimFirstName} will focus on getting one evildoer off of the spacelanes, and let {M0.his}{F0.her} colleagues handle the bigger case.
As soon as the pilots start using {0.SimFirstName}’s system, they realize how much easier they've made things. The feedback on the system is so positive, no one cares that {M0.he}{F0.she} broke the rules.
The client would have paid some major Simoleons to move those dire space chinchillas, and now he’s not happy. He’s trash-talking {0.SimFirstName} all across the galaxy, and pledging all future business to {0.SimFirstName}’s closest competitor. Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to work twice as hard to turn a profit in this sector!
As soon as the pilots start to use it, the system crashes. Now the pilots have to work twice as hard to drive the shuttle, and they tell everyone about {0.SimFirstName}’s dumb plan. {M0.He}{F0.She} is disciplined and forced to clean the lavatories as punishment. 
Everyone knows that customs is the worst-funded part of any government. The tiles sail through undetected and {0.SimFirstName} saves a lot of money.
When {0.SimFirstName} shows up at the rendezvous point with the dire chinchillas, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds half the Planet Patrol there-{M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been set up! {0.SimFirstName} quickly sets {M0.his}{F0.her} ferocious cargo on the Patrol agents and escapes, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has nothing to show for this job.
One of the kids had a laserblade in his pocket-supporting the buzz that young Glorzaks have been gathering weapons lately. Maybe now the Planet Patrol will be able to find and shut down their supplier.
{0.SimFirstName} worries that for the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} life, when things get quiet, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} wonder what that sound was…could it have been the key to understand all of life? Could it have been coded directions to a space treasure? {0.SimFirstName} will never know.
{0.SimFirstName} didn’t see the reports that young Glorzaks have been gathering weapons. Later, one of the boys in the group robs a spacemarket with a pocket laserblade. Could {0.SimFirstName} have prevented the crime?
The Glorzaks were just hanging out, and they appreciated that {0.SimFirstName} didn’t harass them. They share some xxulyps with {M0.him}{F0.her} (they’re like donuts) and give {M0.him}{F0.her} the inside scoop on what’s happening in this sector. Nice kids!
Luckily, the new client has deep pockets. When {0.SimFirstName} delivers the dire chinchillas, he pays {M0.him}{F0.her} double the street value of the critters. And {0.SimFirstName} only suffered a few minor lacerations-no problem!
Just because they’re expensive doesn’t mean they will last a long time or work well. Those panels are junk, and {0.SimFirstName} has to replace them all anyway.
Aha! A faulty connector widget was causing the error messages-the panels are fine after all! Good thing {0.SimFirstName} checked them out.
Sweet Talk the Guard
Use {M0.His}{F0.Her} Authority
Although the old client is angry at {0.SimFirstName} for dumping the moon rocks, the new job has a huge payday. {0.SimFirstName} comes out ahead, and the new client is now a regular client.
{0.SimFirstName} dumps the moon rocks and agrees to take the new job, but the new client never shows up to meet her. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} been played! Now {0.SimFirstName}’s out a lot of cargo, {M0.his}{F0.her} old client is angry, and the new client is nowhere to be found.

{0.SimFirstName} maneuvers the shuttle into landing position, and lets gravity do the rest. {M0.He}{F0.She} didn’t burn up any extra fuel and managed to safely land the craft.
As the shuttle hits the ground, the broken thruster collapses, and the whole ship breaks apart. Luckily it’s just a computer simulation, but {0.SimFirstName} won’t be piloting any real ships anytime soon.
{0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are screaming in {M0.his}{F0.her} ear, but the grateful astronauts inside the shuttle are glad {M0.he}{F0.she} made the safe call. {0.SimFirstName} has the team look into the equipment to find out what’s wrong.

{0.SimFirstName} emerges on the other side of the wormhole, with no memory of recent events. It feels like it’s been several days, but according to the ship’s high-precision digital chronograph it’s only been a few minutes. What happened in the wormhole? And why does {0.SimFirstName} feel so strange?
Hooray! {0.SimFirstName} emerges from the other side of the wormhole into an exact duplicate of {M0.his}{F0.her} own universe, in which the only difference is that {M0.he}{F0.she} is no longer wanted by the law. Wow! What are the odds??
The sheriff is so far back that {0.SimFirstName} has time to see what happens…out from the wormhole floats some kind of unknown crystal formation. Intriguing! {0.SimFirstName} quickly scoops it into {M0.his}{F0.her} ship for further analysis.
After an hour, {0.SimFirstName} accepts that nothing interesting is going to materialize from the wormhole. And this detour gave the Star Sheriff more than enough time to catch up with {0.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} will be forced to dump {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo!

{0.SimFirstName} painstakingly adds, subtracts, and does other complicated math stuff for every single trajectory. It takes a long time, and since the work didn’t require any special expertise, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets no credit for {M0.his}{F0.her} effort. 
Reputation is everything in this business and {0.SimFirstName} is just starting out. Better to be known as someone who gets the job done than to make a few extra Simoleons.
Obey the Order
Follow {M0.His}{F0.Her} Instincts
Violating Code
{0.SimFirstName} hears about a space factory that’s violating the interstellar safety code. When {M0.he}{F0.she} shows up to regulate, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds the entire plant locked down-no passing through, even for law enforcement. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to sweet talk the guard, or use {M0.his}{F0.her} authority to get in the door?
Critical Errors
Solar panels on the shuttle are reporting critical errors during the latest launch simulation. Those puppies are brand-new, and they were expensive! {0.SimFirstName} can either try to fix them, or just install new ones. 
Moon Rock Running
{0.SimFirstName} is cruising through Star Vortex B, carrying a payload of moon rocks for a regular client. But a brand-new client calls with a better offer-much better-although {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to quit {M0.his}{F0.her} current job. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} honor the original job, or ditch it for the better offer?
Small Fire
There’s a small fire on {0.SimFirstName}’s ship! Passing into the thermosphere, an oxygen tank got a little too close to a scented candle. ({M0.He}{F0.She} knew it was a bad idea, even if the extra ambiance was a nice touch.) Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to put the fire out, or head for the escape pod? 
Import Taxes
{0.SimFirstName}’s got a big shipment of Kleebtonic Shuttle Tiles coming in from the planet Qrimple. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} a little cash-poor this month, so the import taxes are going to hurt a bit. Slipping the tiles into some crates of Ultraterran coffee might help them slip past customs. Should {0.SimFirstName} chance it, or just declare the tiles and pay {M0.his}{F0.her} tariff? 
A Passing Grade
{0.SimFirstName}’s got {M0.his}{F0.her} big Space Geography exam coming up tomorrow. If {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t pass, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} never be accepted into Flight School. But {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been doing busy work all day and hasn’t studied.... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} cram or just take it easy, get some rest, and hope for the best?
A Course Decision
{0.SimFirstName}’s already charted out the course for {M0.his}{F0.her} current mission, but mission control says that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} headed straight for a previously undetected asteroid field. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t want the ship to get too banged up, so should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to change {M0.his}{F0.her} course, or just steer very carefully through the asteroids?
Small Capsule
While scrubbing down some exhaust vents on the shuttle, {0.SimFirstName} finds a small capsule stuck to the inside. It looks like it came from outer space! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} turn it in immediately, or open it up to see what’s inside? 
Security Detail
An intergalactic pop star is passing through on her way to a big concert out near the Medrodema Galaxy. As her entourage passes through, she demands patrol officers serve as extra security. Should {0.SimFirstName} assign a few deputies to protect the star, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} turn her down? 
Dangerous Shipment
A new client contacts {0.SimFirstName} about a shipment of Dire Space Chinchillas. {0.SimFirstName}’s never shipped them before-they have nasty little teeth, and if {0.SimFirstName} is caught with them, they could land {M0.him}{F0.her} in space prison. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the dangerous job, or just ignore it? 
Error Message
On a trip to the moons of Wheeler VII, {0.SimFirstName} gets a disturbing error message about a fuel capacity emergency. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} still the junior {M0.spaceman}{F0.spacewoman} on the team, and {M0.his}{F0.her} senior officer says to dump the fuel and head for home. {0.SimFirstName} thinks it’s something else-should {M0.he}{F0.she} obey, or follow {M0.his}{F0.her} instincts? 
Everyone in the galaxy wants a coat made from Snyxskin, and {0.SimFirstName}'s got the biggest cache of pelts. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} charge a fair and reasonable price for the goods, or gouge the customers for all they've got?
Space Mission
{0.SimFirstName} has finally been assigned an official space mission! While on {M0.his}{F0.her} first shuttle trip, a routine exploratory mission around planet Maazaa, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices something strange off in the distance. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} investigate, or leave it alone?
Navigation System
{0.SimFirstName} has a great idea for a new ship navigation system, but it hasn’t been approved by {M0.his}{F0.her} bosses yet. {M0.He}{F0.She} knows it’d save everyone time and energy if they just tried it. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} install it without permission, or wait until {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the final go-ahead?
Simulation Emergency
During a recertification simulation, {0.SimFirstName}’s instructor programs a low-fuel emergency-AND a broken thruster. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} still got to land the ship, so should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to fix the thruster, or land with it broken?
The policy of the Planet Patrol is to stop and search every “suspicious-looking being” an officer encounters, alien or humanoid. {0.SimFirstName}’s out making {M0.his}{F0.her} late-night rounds when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a group of teenage Glorzaks just hanging out. The manual says {M0.he}{F0.she} should search their pockets, but they’re not doing anything wrong. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do? 
Planet Patrol
It’s another routine inspection at Space Way Station Cargo Checkpoint Alpha, and {0.SimFirstName} notices a suspicious wiggling in the back of one spacecraft. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} inspect the cargo immediately, or just look up the pilot’s registration number?
Space Trash
Sheriff {0.SimFirstName}’s been noticing a lot of travelers dumping trash out of their shuttle windows, and it’s littering up all the spaceways. {0.SimFirstName} is sick of paying for the cleanup-should {M0.he}{F0.she} make trash dumping illegal, or just stop cleaning it at all?
Gangster Job
A notorious space gangster has called to offer {0.SimFirstName} a job. He’s a real nasty piece of work-maybe even too nasty for {0.SimFirstName}! For the first time ever, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} conflicted about a job.  Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the assignment, or turn it down? 
Calculations
An analyst asks {0.SimFirstName} to calculate some trajectories for satellite orbits, which is a total snoozefest, and {0.SimFirstName}’s already busy. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either try to find a formula to make the equations easier, or calculate each one by hand.
The Star Sheriff is hot on {0.SimFirstName}'s tail, so {M0.he}{F0.she} takes a detour through an uncharted galaxy—and comes face-to-face with a giant wormhole. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} go through the wormhole to avoid capture, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} wait by it to see what happens?

Salvage Mission
As the rocket sinks another inch into the swamp, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly spies a funny little green man hobbling over to {M0.him}{F0.her}. Amazingly, the creature speaks perfect Simlish! “Help you, I can,” he rasps. Well, almost perfect Simlish. He offers to raise {0.SimFirstName}’s ship from the swamp if {M0.he}{F0.she} can pass certain trials. {0.SimFirstName} agrees.
The Green Man
That’s not what happened! A chrono-shock chrono-rocks the spaceship, sending it home in tatters!
{0.SimFirstName} is off on another amazing adventure in space! Or, {M0.he}{F0.she} would be if {M0.his}{F0.her} ship were actually moving, which it is not. An error message on the main control screen informs {0.SimPronounObjective} that the ship's dynotherm drivers need to be updated.
The asteroid shatters into fragments which burn up harmlessly into the atmosphere. {0.SimFirstName} is able to grab some fragments that blasted loose.
To the east, a jagged series of rocks stabs upward toward the alien sky. It looks like a cross between a mountain range and a pile of shrapnel. {0.SimFirstName} can see a lone curl of smoke rising from one of the peaks. To the west, the valley looks much easier to traverse but there are no obvious signs of life.
{0.SimFirstName} quietly follows the creature. {F0.She}{M0.He} notices that the alien changes colors in a certain pattern, seemingly as a way to communicate. Eventually, the creature flies away.
“Time for the first trial, it is,” rasps the creature, “Pick a number between one and ten.” “Four,” says {0.SimFirstName}. “Well done. Now, the second trial…” Hey, this is easy! The creature continues, “Make me some lunch, you will.” {0.SimFirstName} could search in the surrounding jungle, or there might be some kind of fish in the swamp?
The ship's blasters don't even make a dent on the rock. {0.SimFirstName} has no choice but to block the asteroid with the ship!
{0.SimFirstName} is almost out the door when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears a chorus of tiny, beseeching voices. Surely it couldn't hurt to hear one or two prayers, right? When else will {0.SimFirstName} get the chance?
{0.SimFirstName} tries to shove all the stuff into the cargo bay, but they hear a terrible CRUNCH - the alien's terrarium just shattered. Oops. Since he has nowhere to put his prized &quot;pet,&quot; he gives it to {0.SimFirstName} as payment for the ride. &quot;His name is Bandit,&quot; says the alien.
Yes! Those amazing ion cannons blast off the pastry bunny’s arm. A new arm starts to regenerate, but the bunny seems to have learned its lesson and floats off into space.
Well, if smiting is what the people want....{0.SimFirstName} starts squashing some of the offenders with {M0.his}{F0.her} thumb or brushing them into the trash. But now all of the aliens are terrified of {0.SimPronounObjective}! {0.SimFirstName}'s losing their goodwill!
Sure enough, the map leads {0.SimFirstName} to a charred-looking planet with a lone tree growing from a cliff. At first glance the place seems abandoned, but then {M0.he}{F0.she} notices the opening to a small tunnel beneath the tree. Go in?
{0.SimFirstName} sends a message of peace to the creature, who responds by flashing bright red. Suddenly, a much bigger plumbob creature appears around the side of the asteroid, looking quite angry. Does {0.SimFirstName} attempt to fight the creature, or flee?
An asteroid is rocketing towards the planet! What is {0.SimFirstName} going to do?!
After double-checking Fitz’s photo in the {M0.men’s room}{F0.ladies’ room}, {0.SimFirstName} asks the alien about the leash. Flustered, the alien begins to swell and turn yellow, but insists it came from a solar cat they had recently captured. Just then, {0.SimFirstName} hears a whimper from beneath the desk. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} make a grab for the animal or wait for an explanation?
{0.SimFirstName} is soaring through the outer reaches of space when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices an insanely bright—something—glowing below {0.SimPronounObjective}. As {M0.he}{F0.she} swings in closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} hears engines revving and realizes: it’s an interstellar race track! There’s a prize for the winner, but these contestants are no joke. {0.SimFirstName} better be sure {M0.his}{F0.her} ship is up to it. Join the race?
&quot;What's wrong with this civilization!?&quot; {0.SimFirstName} yells. {M0.He}{F0.She} gives the aliens a piece of {M0.his}{F0.her} mind and then walks off in a huff. Despite all the nice things {M0.he}{F0.she} did for them, it looks like {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll be remembered as a despot. As {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship heads for home, the alien historians begin writing of these dark, troubled times.
Stupid ship! Stupid air! Why won't this spaceship window OPEN?! It must be a conspiracy... Well {0.SimFirstName} isn't going to let them get {M0.him}{F0.her} that easily. It'll all be okay if {M0.he}{F0.she} can just get this window open!!
The instant {0.SimFirstName} opens the ship door, the animals swarm {0.SimPronounObjective}! Rethinking {M0.his}{F0.her} approach, {M0.he}{F0.she} opens a portal near the rocket’s tip and tosses out a juicy filet mignon, deftly seasoned with tranquilizers. The biggest beast seizes it, swallows it and promptly keels over. With a little help from {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty grappler, {0.SimFirstName} has the perfect alien specimen!
No luck! {0.SimFirstName} gives the Cosmic Relief fighter a good chase, but it eventually disables one of {M0.his}{F0.her} engines and {M0.he}{F0.she} is forced to return Fitz in the PoochPod they send over. {0.SimFirstName} will have to watch the black market for him—assuming {M0.his}{F0.her} remaining engine can get {0.SimPronounObjective} home.
It isn’t easy to get the alien’s attention—until {0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ion cannons to blast some rocks from his stash. Spooked, the alien jets away in his flying saucer, squealing at the top of its lung-thingies. The interference stops, and {0.SimFirstName} gets some free space rocks for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble!
{0.SimFirstName} is just about to beat {M0.his}{F0.her} personal best time around planet Daiscot when a Comm Alert breaks {M0.his}{F0.her} concentration. It’s Dispatch, requesting assistance with a civil dispute on Hiattooine. Itching for a change of scene, {0.SimFirstName} agrees to the mission and blasts over to see what’s what.
What's that up ahead? {0.SimFirstName} cruises over for a closer look and sees a hulking old ship. It's flying a flag with a spacecash symbol, which is the intergalactic symbol for commerce. It's a trader ship that wants to do business. {0.SimFirstName} begins the docking procedure.
Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} botches {M0.his}{F0.her} attempt at diplomacy again, and a skirmish ensues, {0.SimFirstName} the valiant winner. Avoiding the time-edge this time around, {0.SimFirstName} returns home a hero.
{0.SimFirstName} is off to an excellent start! Rounding the 105th bend, {M0.he}{F0.she} reassesses {M0.his}{F0.her} position in the pack. The dog girl is giving {0.SimPronounObjective} a run for {M0.his}{F0.her} money, and Red Tooth isn’t far behind. Should {0.SimFirstName} rattle Dog Girl’s confidence by stepping on it, or hang back and keep pace until the final laps?
Dog Girl must not have any greyhound in her. {0.SimFirstName} easily keeps pace and manages to eke past her in the final lap to pull off the win! Prize money in hand, {M0.he}{F0.she} hightails it out of there, careful to ditch any disgruntled losers before heading home.
{0.SimFirstName} picks up a piece of metal pipe and shouts, “Anybody there?” The rattling stops. Silence. {M0.He}{F0.She} calls again. Again there’s no response. Whatever’s in there doesn’t want to be found. {0.SimFirstName} has two choices: {M0.he}{F0.she} can brace the door shut, or go in swinging.
{0.SimFirstName} calls out. No answer. The only sound is a soft dripping. {M0.He}{F0.She} treads quietly into the tunnel—but suddenly everything goes black. {M0.He}{F0.She} whirls, flipping on {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty headlamp. Eyes glow in the narrow beam—not two, but hundreds. {0.SimFirstName} can try to talk {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of this, or run like crazy.
{0.SimFirstName} is escorted down a long hallway by a grumpy-looking guard. He shoves {0.SimFirstName} into an examination room and explains that {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} need a rabies shot if  {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to get near the animals. Does {0.SimFirstName} agree to the injection?
Well, that didn’t work. {0.SimFirstName} thought {M0.his}{F0.her} story about losing {M0.his}{F0.her} mutt was rather convincing—{M0.he}{F0.she} even mustered a tear—but the alien isn’t letting {0.SimPronounObjective} past the desk. She can search the computer for recent records or take down {M0.his}{F0.her} info. {0.SimFirstName} agrees to the search to buy time.
{0.SimFirstName} studies the aliens closely--they appear to want more water to grow their crops. But {M0.he's}{F0.she's} an angry, jealous deity, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to test them a little.
{0.SimFirstName} retrieves a treasure from the rocket’s storage, dons {F0.her}{M0.his} spacesuit and backs into a space-moonwalk. {F0.She}{M0.He} leaves the treasure where it was found, and returns. What happened just before?
After double-checking Fitz’s photo in the {M0.men’s room}{F0.ladies’ room}, {0.SimFirstName} asks the alien where the red leash came from. Indignant, the alien begins to swell and turn yellow, then presses a button under the desk. A guard appears with a long, shiny needle and seizes {0.SimFirstName}.
Without the super ion cannons, the blasts bounce right off of the bunny! The angry bunny turns toward {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, but luckily {M0.he}{F0.she} gets away!
{0.SimFirstName} studies the aliens closely - they appear to want more water to grow their crops. The loving, benevolent thing to do would be to give it to them, right?
Deep in the Evil Cave, {0.SimFirstName} encounters {M0.his}{F0.her} ultimate challenge: Nega-{0.SimFirstName}!! And {0.SimFirstName} has no weapons! Luckily, after explaining the situation, Nega-{0.SimFirstName} agrees to just pretend like {0.SimFirstName} defeated {0.SimPronounObjective} so {0.SimFirstName} can go home. Turns out Nega-{0.SimFirstName} is pretty cool. Now to see if that funny creature can get the ship out of the swamp!
The asteroid smashes into the ship with the force of giant chunk of rock that's been hurtling through space. Luckily, it shatters, but the ship shudders from the impact. It might be rough getting home!
{0.SimFirstName} dives into the ship and snaps the door shut seconds before the beast slams into the rocket’s side. Safely inside the ship, {0.SimFirstName} can dress {M0.his}{F0.her} wounds and effect the needed repairs to the port compression coil. It’s time to head home.
{0.SimFirstName} is gliding through the galaxy when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a constellation {M0.he}{F0.she} has never seen before. Double-checking {M0.his}{F0.her} coordinates {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is not where {M0.he}{F0.she} thought at all. What’s more, {M0.his}{F0.her} ship’s GPS (Galactic Positioning System) has gone black. {M0.He}{F0.She} is lost in space!
All of a sudden, {0.SimFirstName} sees a big shadow. {M0.He}{F0.She} quickly looks to see a giant pastry freezer bunny floating by. It looks like it has its eyes focused on another satellite and starts to shoot pink frosting!
&quot;Oh why has thou forsaken us?&quot; cry the aliens. But {0.SimFirstName} just laughs maniacally and continues to be capriciously evil.
{0.SimFirstName} discovers the planet is a giant landfill—a junkyard for broken spacecraft and discarded instruments. {M0.He}{F0.She} has just enough time to collect a few treasures before finding a safe route home.
Rattle—rattle—crash! {0.SimFirstName} is on the way back from the Comet ESON Flea Market when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears banging inside {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship’s cargo hold. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks back through recent salvage efforts … nothing living, certainly. Should {0.SimFirstName} call out, or try to take whatever it is by surprise?
{0.SimFirstName} smacks {M0.his}{F0.her} comm system again. Ever since {M0.he}{F0.she} arrived in space, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been experiencing tons of interference in {M0.his}{F0.her} radio communications. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} about to phone tech support when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees it: the fifth solar flare in the last half hour. That explains it! {0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} better go investigate.
It seems fairly obvious at this point that the crew has completely lost their marbles. {0.SimFirstName} sneaks through the fight and grabs the box of food, hiding it away so they won't waste it. {0.SimFirstName} returns to the rocket and contacts command, who will send a rescue party of trained professionals soon.
Mayday! Mayday! {0.SimFirstName} is cruising through space when {M0.he}{F0.she} receives a distress call from another ship. {M0.He}{F0.She} can’t make out everything the pilot is saying, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does have a clear reading on its location. {M0.He}{F0.She} sets a course to save them.
{0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door, shouting. Something small and orange scampers behind a crate. Scanning the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees that a display for a taxidermied alien {M0.he}{F0.she} found is empty! “Don’t hurt me!” a tiny voice cries. Four eyes peek from behind the crate. {0.SimFirstName} lowers the pipe.
The aliens are pushing some pebbles around and desperately trying to start a farm on a large pile of mold. {0.SimFirstName} can only think of two kinds of deities: the loving, benevolent kind and the angry, jealous kind.
Luckily the police captain seems to be into {0.SimFirstName}. With a dash of charm and some crafty fast-talk, {0.SimFirstName} distracts the cop from performing a thorough search, and the police are gone in no time. Now {0.SimFirstName} just has to find {M0.his}{F0.her} alien friend!
{0.SimFirstName} cruises around picking up all the space junk {M0.he}{F0.she} can find. As it turns out, there is a LOT of junk up here, and the cabin is quickly too full to move in, so {0.SimFirstName} heads home. As {M0.he}{F0.she} re-enters the atmosphere, the Space Madness wears off. &quot;Where did all this junk come from?&quot; {0.SimFirstName} wonders.
Eh, {0.SimFirstName} has had {M0.his}{F0.her} fun. And these aliens have learned a valuable lesson about something...probably. {0.SimFirstName} returns to the ship, leaving the tiny civilization to its own devices until the next &quot;supreme being&quot; makes a rest stop.
{0.SimFirstName} is filling up on rocket fuel when an alien spacecraft pulls up to the pump next to {0.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't think much of it until {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the alien loading crates onto {M0.his}{F0.her} ship! “The space police are after me!” the alien shouts. “Hide this stuff! I promise I'll make it worth it!”
They want water? {0.SimFirstName} will give them water - {M0.he}{F0.she} fills a bucket full of water and dumps it all over their colony so that it floods their fields. Power is fun, huh, {0.SimFirstName}? What's next?
{0.SimFirstName} makes an admirable attempt to communicate {M0.his}{F0.her} situation through a series of wild hand gestures and earnest facial expressions. The creature mumbles something in a bizarre language and hands over the part! {0.SimFirstName} can return home! ({M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} never know it, but the alien said {M0.he}{F0.she} reminded it of {M0.an uncle}{F0.an aunt} it had back on Grzypllflotz.)
Yeehaw! Nothing like a wide-eyed kid to make {0.SimFirstName} feel like a hero. Kicking {M0.his}{F0.her} ship into hyperwarp, {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts loops around Planet Toomootoo—until suddenly lights appear in the distance. Space cops! {0.SimFirstName} could pull over and try to explain, or try to outrun them.
Good thing {0.SimFirstName} invested in those trusty Ion Cannons. With a few well-placed blasts, the Cosmic Relief fighter is completely disabled. Fitzy-Poo, it's time to head home.
The aliens give thanks, but they're a little miffed. What kind of deity would let {M0.his}{F0.her} people suffer that way? They lose faith. Soon, the prayers stop and the tiny civilization just ignores {0.SimFirstName} entirely. During the long flight home {M0.he}{F0.she} can reflect on the ramifications of power.
Grasping the pipe tighter, {0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door and swings wildly. Just then, something soft and squishy thumps onto {M0.his}{F0.her} back and a tentacle threads around {M0.his}{F0.her} neck. “Don’t move!” a small voice whispers. Everything goes black. {0.SimFirstName} faints, which is technically moving.
Error - Error!  !rorrE -rorrE --  After a perilous journey to the deepest, darkest, edges of space and time, {0.SimFirstName} has ricocheted off of the edge of TIME ITSELF, and is now retracing {F0.her}{M0.his} sojourn in reverse! The rocket is backing into a debris field; what happened here?
As {0.SimFirstName} draws closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that it's an alien spacecraft piloted by a 3-eyed, 16-tentacled alien, who is grinning too much to be in real distress. Claiming to be the best starfighter in the universe, the alien challenges {M0.him}{F0.her} to a duel and offers a substantial reward. Does {0.SimFirstName} accept?
Once in orbit, {0.SimFirstName} gets an odd message from the International Sims Space Station. It's badly garbled and makes little sense. {0.SimFirstName} decides to fly over and check it out.
{0.SimFirstName} knows it’s best not to mess with the law in this quadrant. Besides, someone could have planted the kid just for an excuse to attack. The space cops pick up 4 Eyes and take it home, offering {0.SimFirstName} a small reward for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble.
{0.SimFirstName} can already feel the force of the black hole sucking {M0.his}{F0.her} ship closer. No time to waste! Securing the alien spaceship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket with titanium cable, {M0.he}{F0.she} crosses {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers and engages {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters. Yes! It works. The pilot is so thrilled to have his ship safe, he awards {0.SimFirstName} his most valuable cargo. Score!
Oh no! {0.SimFirstName}'s bad aim has blasted off part of the satellite! Surely everyone's data plan is going to blow up, and OMG, those roaming charges! If only {0.SimFirstName} were more focused!
{0.SimFirstName} scans the tank with {M0.his}{F0.her} special micronoscope, and sees the serial number…it's from {M0.his}{F0.her} own ship! Whoa, this is crazy. How did it get outside? 
Each specimen is weirder and more breathtaking than the last. One looks like a preserved alien with gills AND a nose! As {0.SimFirstName}'s putting the jar in {F0.her}{M0.his} pocket, the ship starts violently shaking. Time to go! As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back on {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket, {0.SimFirstName} feels the ship start breaking apart. Some debris hits the thrusters.... Hope the ship makes it home okay.
Diplomacy first, {0.SimFirstName} always says, and this time it actually works! The colonists only have small demands—a tiny raise in wages, the ability to gather and discuss ideas—but they quickly drop the wage increase to reunite with their government. At the Celebration, everyone enjoys free soup and {0.SimFirstName} is rewarded handsomely for {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts.
{0.SimFirstName}'s never seen rocks like this before! As {M0.he}{F0.she}'s shoving rocks into {M0.his}{F0.her} pockets, the ship starts violently shuddering and breaking apart. {0.SimFirstName} makes it back to the rocket, but a piece of debris hits the back fender, damaging it severely. {F0.She}{M0.He}'ll have to hope that it's spaceworthy for the journey home.
Oh hecks no, {0.SimFirstName}'s not getting on that ship. That's how sci-fi/horror movies start! Odds are, there's nothing on there but rogue viruses, hibernating alien monsters, or something even more horrible. {M0.He}{F0.She} gathers a few pipes and widgets from the outside and gets away before anything terrible can happen.
It's so pretty outside! Look! The Northern Lights!! {0.SimFirstName} can't spend the whole space day cooped up inside like this! {M0.He}{F0.She} needs to get out there and enjoy the beautiful weather! {M0.He}{F0.She} ventures toward the air lock and gets ready to go outside and take a nice walk.
&quot;Space madness,&quot; {0.SimFirstName} carefully enunciates into the comm. &quot;You have selected: Self Destruct,&quot; the voice says, &quot;Remotely engaging your ship's self destruct funtion now.&quot;
That tank must have been tampered with!  {M0.He}{F0.She} knew there was something fishy going on.{0.SimFirstName} puts the tank in the air lock and jets it into space. A few minutes later {M0.he}{F0.she} sees an empty air tank float by {M0.his}{F0.her} window. How did that get there? Is someone following {0.SimPronounObjective}? Is it some kind of listening device?
In a surprising reversal of fortune for the space pirates, {0.SimFirstName} blows open their cargo hold with a well-aimed spazerbeam. Looks like there's some decently valuable junk in there too! {0.SimFirstName} quickly collects what {M0.he}{F0.she} can and blasts off for home.

Tree Adventure
This trunk is a lot bigger than anticipated!  It's dark… but somehow not scary.  A faint glow is the only light, a rolling burble the only sound.
The mist is warm and friendly, as far as mists go.  Without warning, {0.SimFirstName} feels the sensation of being spun around, an exit to the cave now staring {M0.him}{F0.her} in the face.
Having barely missed the mist, {0.SimFirstName} is in the clear, but thoroughly disoriented. {M0.He}{F0.She} scrambles about, eventually crawling towards the cavernous trunk's entrance.
{0.SimFirstName} delves a bit deeper, and a bit darker.  A soft splash tells {M0.him}{F0.her} that {M0.he}{F0.she} has just stepped into a shallow stream.
Taking the path of least resistance, and hoping that it doesn't terminate at a sewer main, {0.SimFirstName} is distracted by an ethereal  mist, glowing ominously.
{0.SimFirstName} follows the light, all too soon realizing that it was coming from the very place where {M0.he}{F0.she} entered.
{0.SimFirstName} trudges up a slight slope, with only the gentle resistance of current to guide {M0.him}{F0.her}.  Soon, however, everything dries up.  Without light or direction, {M0.he}{F0.she} is wandering blind.

Explore The Mystical Magic Bean Portal Tree
{0.SimFirstName} stepped into the portal, expecting darkness, but was instead greeted by a bright sunny pasture, filled with all kinds of flora.\n\nA tree stood off to one side, glowing and bearing fruit.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} plucked a fruit from the tree, and immediately found the sunny landscape disintegrate into darkness. Before {M0.he}{F0.she} knew it, {M0.he}{F0.she} had stepped out of the tree's portal with something in {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket.

Step onto the Ledge
The switchback leads {0.SimFirstName} up and down a dank corridor, around a bend, and through a particularly confined tunnel.  {0.SimFirstName} is back at the entrance!
No need to try something dangerous!  {0.SimFirstName} creeps down the main branch, and spies through the dim remaining light a switchback headed gradually up, and a rickety ladder headed down.
Exploring Cave
{0.SimFirstName}, ever the intrepid explorer, sets out to spelunk the cave. There are two pathways.  The narrower of the two is a bit stalac-tight, but {0.SimFirstName} stalag-might fit if {M0.he}{F0.she} squeezes.
A soft mossy path leads {0.SimFirstName} effortlessly onward, until {M0.he}{F0.she} spies the entranceway to a beautiful grotto.
{0.SimFirstName} carefully plunges into a black abyss, groping {M0.his}{F0.her} way along splintery rungs. After a long descent, a faint azure light starts to fill the expanse below. {M0.He}{F0.She} can step off onto a dim mossy precipice, or continue into the blue.
The dark, winding fissure proves too difficult to navigate.  {0.SimFirstName} quickly becomes stymied and frustrated.
Seemingly infinite rungs take {0.SimFirstName} down, and down, and down.  After an exhausting while, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to retreat, lest {M0.he}{F0.she} get stuck down there forever...

Ponderosa Pine Tree
Bright green needles and a pleasantly pronounced fragrance distinguish these trees, which are particularly suitable as windbreaks and for erosion control.

Upright Cypress Tree
Plant a row of fast-growing cypress trees for an instant, evergreen privacy screen.
Slender Cypress Tree
Prune this fast-growing ornamental tree early and often for best landscaping results.
Elm Tree
Elms are among the most widely planted ornamental trees in the world. They make excellent shade trees.
Ornamental Bamboo Tree
Botanically speaking, bamboo is classified as a grass rather than as a true tree. Bamboo grows quickly and can be a pest when not properly maintained.
Quaking Aspen Tree

Cypresses are traditionally planted in graveyards and are thus a symbol of mourning -- perfect for your uber-Gothic garden.

Nature lovers are fond of beech trees, as their nuts provide an important food source for wildlife such as turkeys, porcupines, chipmunks, wood ducks, and jays.
European Beech Tree
Beech trees require a humid atmosphere and well-drained soil to thrive. They prefer slightly shady conditions and should be given plenty of space to grow.
Evergreen
For a pine-scented evergreen, this is your go-to choice.
Hawthorne Tree
Also known as the thornapple, whitehorn, or mayhaw, the hawthorne produces masses of small white flowers and small apple-like fruits.

Year of the Pig Statuette
&lt;i&gt;This Pig statuette was granted for the New Lunar Year of the Pig, starting in February 2019.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nEvery new lunar year, the countryside animals celebrate in a grand hall decorated with symbolic sycees and paper lanterns.  This year, the new year arrived without the honored animal.\n\nThe Pig arrived near the party's end and sat at a table in quiet embarrassment, noticed by the Goat. With all red envelopes gifted and food eaten, the Goat plucked a kumquat from a potted citrus tree and offered half to the Pig. She accepted with relief and explained she could not find anyone to care for her piglets until friendly Crows returned to her farm. With the Goat's understanding and help with introductions, the Pig's embarrassment melted away to happiness during the remaining festivities.\n\nThe celebration ended at sunrise, and the Goat accompanied the Pig home. They decided their children should meet and exchange panda toys as friends, just as they had become.\n\nIt is okay to be last and late. Good friends will wait for you.
Sycee of the Prosperous Moon
&lt;i&gt;This decoration was granted for the New Lunar Year of the Pig, starting in February 2019.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe Pig returned home from the New Lunar Year celebration to find her piglets bundled in slumber, and the guardian Crows huddled in sleep nearby.  With her arrival, the Crows awoke and recounted how excited her children were for the new year.\n\nAs they were leaving, the Pig retrieved a metallic object from a mantle and offered, &quot;I have nothing of value that matches the good fortune I've had tonight save for this heirloom, so I wish to pass that luck to you in gratitude.&quot; The Crows left with a promise to visit again soon.\n\nAt their nest, the Crows examined the sycee quizzically for a while, and tried prying it open. Unsuccessful, there was a moment of silence... and finally sudden laughter and exclamation: &quot;Oh, it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a bowl with food or drink inside!&quot;

Appreciably Average Digital Camera
Does your baby or dog pose so adorably that you simply must capture every single moment? Is your phone so overloaded with baby and dog pics that you don't have space for apps? Pick up the Appreciably Average Digital Camera and free yourself to take as many pictures of your baby riding your dog like a cowboy as you could possibly want!
Crystal Clear Digital Camera
Made for the true perfectionist, the Crystal Clear Digital Camera is the most accurate photo taking device on the market today. Capturing over a gajillion pixels per photo, viewers will be able to see every tiny detail of every photo taken. Just don't expect to take many photos. That kind of quality comes with a price, and the price is that this camera can only hold 10 pictures at a time. 
Barely Better Digital Camera
Due to its cheap price, this camera is often purchased as a gift for fledgling photographers; however, with picture quality only a smidge better than what a standard smartphone is equipped with, this camera generally ends up as a paperweight. Mostly bought by out of touch family members who are too cheap to go for even middle of the line stuff.

Ode to Jazz Triptych Trio
One thing Princess Cordelia simply couldn’t fit on her submersible was her beloved jazz band. She so missed their music that she painted a series of pictures to commemorate it. Framed in celebratory gold frames, this collection reunites three of her favorite musicians-may they play together in peace on your wall.
Ode to Jazz Wall Painting 2: “Goldentips” in Gold
When Princess Cordelia was forced to flee her kingdom, she had to leave her beloved jazz band behind. Framed in a celebratory gold frame, this wistful silhouette portrays the sax legend Jacob Goldentips still playing in the depths of the sea, which was how the Princess liked to imagine him. [Must be placed on at least a two-story wall.] 
“Blooming Beauty” Wall Painting
Of course, there were no flowers in Princess Cordelia’s subaquatic life, but she had an acute memory of the vases and vases of them that once adorned the Royal House. Oh, the fragrance! Princess Cordelia couldn’t replicate the scent of course, but her painting was quite lifelike.
Land-Coral Garden
Princess Cordelia painted this before gradually fleeing from the giant sloths. Photographs were not commonplace yet, so this painting was all she had to remind her of her old palace’s painting studio. While sitting comfortably on her escape submarine, she changed the name from “Flower Still Life,” to “Land-Coral Garden.”
The Pianist
Not all of Princess Cordelia’s entertainers perished in the Great Sloth Invasion. This pianist knew that if his body was to perish, his name must live on for him. So, he rolled his piano out atop the submersible and played until it went under.
Etude in Blue
Just like music, art can be a celebration-of things we love, of experiences we adore, of people left behind. This abstract painting is a beautiful reverie, a nostalgic tribute to the ne’er-to-be-forgotten performances of years past.
Ode to Jazz 6: “Ghost Quartet”
Some days, the thought of her long-lost jazz musicians was simply too much for Princess Cordelia to bear. She even went so far as to have new instruments made, but with no one to play them, all she could do was paint pictures of them.
Jazz Cats: Whiskers of a Forgotten Past
One thing the Princess was thrilled to leave back in her former kingdom was cats. They shed everywhere and made her sneeze! But nostalgia is a funny thing, and so the princess found herself painting them. As you can tell from this design, her portrayals were a touch romantic.
Saxophone in Silhouette 
Great jazz is hard to come by, especially in the depths of the sea, so Princess Cordelia commissioned a mute reproduction of glorious jazz music. 
Floored by Symmetry Standing Mirror
There it is again. The pure, clean lines of an adulterated rectangle. And shining forth from the heart of its simplicity? You. Stunning!
Captain Chaz MacFreeling Mirror
Princess Cordelia’s second pirate boyfriend was handsome and, relative to other pirates, had good hygiene! Things started off great, but the princess noticed him looking in the mirror all the time; so vain. She promptly sent him on his way, giving him a handful of citrus for any future scurvy outbreaks, and naming all her mirrors after him.

Mega Door (Budget DeLite)
One of our top designers challenged us to make a door “without all the bells and whistles.” We found out later that he was crazy and meant it literally, but we still went ahead with our plans for the Budget DeLite model of our Mega Door. The minimally acceptable amount of door for not a lot of Simoleons!
Mega Door (Deluxe)
The phrase “exceptional quality in mission-style door-making” gets thrown around a lot these days. We at the MegaMission Outdoor Warehouse like to think that we’ve truly earned that praise with the deluxe model of our Mega Door.

Overdesigned Window
We’ll be honest. We set out to make a simple window, split into three equal panes. Then we just kept adding and adding features and now everyone thinks it’s a door. Our fault really - we can see now how the whole project is a little overdesigned. Use it however you’d like.
Perfect Pane Door
Hardwood window frames can cause your glass panes to scratch and crumble at the edges. They can even stress your windows to the point of shattering! The Perfect Pane door has firm yet pliable frames that keep glass pristine. That’s because they’re made entirely from the bones of Atlantic Sturgeon!
Unbranded Entry Device
Sure, it might not have a fancy label, but our unbranded entry device is just as effective as all those name brand Doors. Built from many of the same materials, the unbranded entry device offers an opening and closing experience just as good as the major brands, and at just as good a price!
Marine Biologist's Choice
When you come home from a day of measuring the seasonal rise of Vibrio bacteria in brackish waters, you need a door you can rely on. That’s why so many Marine biologists choose this door. You might be worried about ineffective efforts to save the Atlantic sturgeon, but you’ll never have to worry about coming home to an inferior door.

Narrow Mission-Style Arch
Arches have a higher load-bearing capacity than a simple post-and-lintel structure, allowing for a wider range of use and facilitating taller construction.

The keystone detailing is not integral to the arch; it just looks nice.
Prairie Post and Lintel Knockoff
Visually evoke Prairie-style architecture without breaking the bank; save money on the lack of door, too.
Arch E
There were four prototypes… the first prototype didn’t open, the second prototype refined the concept, removing the defect by making a hole, the third prototype increased the size of the hole, the fourth prototype removed the sharp edges that were causing an increase in workplace accidents. The fifth, Arch E, should be great…

Island Mahogany Grand Sliding Door
The closest form of civilization to East Shore Chateau was a small coastal fishing village. The community watched from afar as Mason Lupoe first purchased the estate and soon after began repairs. The sounds of saws and hammers echoed through the dense surrounding jungle, washed out by the nearby waves breaking against the beach. Then one day... nothing.\n\nNo sim came or went from East Shore Chateau, and it remained disturbingly quiet as weeks stretched on. Mason Lupoe, himself, was declared missing. Investigators and anyone looking into the disappearances also seemed to vanish in the shadow cast by East Shore. It was at that point, the community made a decision. The estate was to be torn down from the outside in.\n\nAnd so it was done. Plank by plank, window by window, the estate was dismantled—its fine furnishing and trim re-purposed around the island. The doors were sold in an auction. It is said... that on humid summer nights the doors can be heard sliding open and closed as the spirits of those missing pass through.

Island Mahogany Sliding Door
East Shore Chateau sat abandoned for years. A brisk jaunt from the beach and surrounded by thick vegetation, its interior smelled of jungle musk, decaying mahogany, and sea air. Various species of vibrantly plumed birds and neon specked frogs called its dilapidated remains home. Few locals who remained on the island remembered the mystery surrounding its downfall—even fewer still spoke of it.\n\nIt was inevitable that when Mason Lupoe bought the mansion, it would cause quite a stir...

Dead Space Porcupine

Dead Space Squid
With six appendages, partial transparency, and an unusually reflective outer membrane, this specimen likely evolved on a water-planet before arriving at the point of discovery.

Preliminary readings suggest that this &quot;skeleton&quot; emits a constant stream of short-wave transmissions--often involving what appear to be numerical tallies.

Sunsurfer Frog
The Sunsurfer Frog sports a splashy, yellow wave pattern. It sunburns easily and always wears SPF 50.
Heartsurfer Frog
The Heartsurfer Frog is known for its coat of distinct red waves. Romance novels are its favorite literary genre.
Surfer Leaf Frog
The Surfer Leaf Frog has a calming, green wave pattern on its spine. A certified accountant, it’s most commonly spotted during tax season.
Tiger Frog
The Tiger Frog’s sunshine-colored stripes lend to its cat-like appearance. Single old lady ducks keep Tiger Frogs around as company.
Striped Heart Frog
The Common Striped Heart Frog’s back is stamped with a bright, red line. Never wake it up before 10 a.m. (It's a total grumpus.)

A deposit of sedimentary earth and stone containing strange traces of foreign particles
Time has not been kind to what's left of these bones. This fossil has fragmented into several pieces.
Limestone
Broken Fossil
Fossilized Udder
Every scientist knows that prehistoric cows had rows of jagged teeth like a mako shark. No wonder, then, that their udders evolved to be very tough. That's why this specimen is almost perfectly preserved eons after these gentle giants roamed the world.
Fossilized Whatzit
This fossil has stumped experts from every conventional scientific discipline. No one knows what it really is.
Fossilized Alien Skull
This could be the evidence needed to confirm that there are other forms of life in the universe!! Or it could be papier mache -- science has no way of telling!
Pre-Pre-Pre Sim Head
Australosimicus afarensis, or &quot;Pre-Pre-Pre Sim,&quot; lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago! Not that WHOLE time, of course, that's just a range of possible… Look, this is a rare find and it should be treasured!
Perfectly Preserved Mustache
This fossil marks the passing of an ancient gentleman of true class. A gentleman who fell face-first into some ancient mud.
Prehistoric Bird
This is a near-perfect preservation of Raptor Erraticus, which was known to fly in random, crazy patterns to distract predators. A downside to this particular defense was that the bird often flew into trees or rocks and was immediately killed.
Prehistoric Rock
In prehistoric times rocks were shaped like sharp little triangles, which ancient hunters would use to catch food. Over time people began to plant, farm, and raise livestock. They had no more need for these rocks, and so the rocks evolved into the smooth blobs we see today.
Enormous Trilobite
Trilobite means three lobes. It does not mean being bit at a strength three times a normal bite. If that were the case, arthropods would be terrifying!
Pre-Historic Hoofprint
An ancient caveman preserved animal footprints as a hobby, displaying them in a popular museum-cave for all the other cavepeople to cave-enjoy. What an amazing convenience it was for modern anthropologists to find these preserved footprints all in one place!
Fossilized Sim Hand
This fossilized hand serves as a somber reminder that excessive and overzealous high-fiving can lead to tragedy.

Toy Tales
Imagine a world in which the sandbox isn’t just filled with cold, lifeless toys, but vibrantly alive with ones that speak and emote! It’s all here in Toy Tales, a heartwarming story about how a young girl’s toys tell her how to reach for her dreams.
MaxisMan Saves the City
Look to the lower atmosphere! What do you see? Is it a choo choo careening off the rails? Or a wanton bear looking for artisanal honey? No, it’s MaxisMan and he’s here to save the day!
Like You for the Time Being
In a world where we’re all unique snowflakes, it’s good to remind toddlers that sometimes they have more in common with others than their differences. Before beautiful hair grows, and muscles form, soft, plushy toddlers are all bald little similarities. Embrace it, at least for now.
Squares and You
Before the younglings are ready for curves, straight lines, or fewer than four sides, we have Squares…and you! Squares and You is the Award-Winning landmark educational title that knocked Geometry in the Womb off its well-accolated perch and told Rhombus Rompus to take a hike!
When Is Winter?

Monkey Brown on the Monkey Bars
Monkey Brown went up the bars and oops he fell and broke his thars. What should Monkey Brown have learned as a result of this handle-barred hiccup, and were the parents to blame? You won’t be able to stop this true crime (or is it a true accident?!) page turner of a toddler thriller.
Dog on a Log
In the quiet town of Hannawee, a lonely family finds their hearts swollen with sadness when the rainy seasons begin. But, atop the log on the flooded river, a mysterious Dog on a Log arrives, and none of their lives will ever be the same.
Baby Bill and the Bobcat
Journey at night to the woods and the thicket where Baby Bill and the Bobcat are in a sticky wicket. Parents will love BB and the B’s strong use of natural insights and subtle commentary on the modern industrial complex, whereas children will delight at the pages’ fluffy texture.
Charlotte's Pig
There are times in a farmer’s life when they know that their one pig is not just some pig but the fun pig. Charlotte’s Pig is the charming, triumphant morality tale of a pig who teaches their owner that sometimes, you just need to look around and smell the bacon.
Rex Treks
Long before the shortly armed bipedal tyrants met their fate at the whims of a fiery rock or icy cold, these reptilian beasts strutted their stuff just beyond the primordial soup. With informative pictures and rhyming scientific names, Rex Treks is a journey to days a million past for children eager to take their first step in the fossil record.

The writers {0.SimFirstName} help out  thanked {F0.her}{M0.him} for helping add to the comic's world history and lore. The content provided helped them cement where they wanted the series to go for the next three years. Now {0.SimFirstName} just has to wait until the next arc of the comic begins to see how their ideas are used.
{0.SimFirstName}'s contributions to the extended universe inspired the series writers to start a new comic arc focusing on the characters and content {F0.she}{M0.he} developed. Solstice Comics expressed a desire to work with {0.SimFirstName} again in the future, backing this statment with a sizable bonus.
&quot;Dear {F0.madam}{M0.sir}, Solstice comics is sorry to inform you that the project you were contracted to work on has been cancelled due to missed deadlines and work flow issues. We thank you for the time spent working hard on our award winning comics and will reach out if we wish to procure your talents for another contract.&quot;
{0.SimName} took all the elements of the dystopian, hopeless world and made the cold equations necessary to write a futuristic story of escaping the futuristic prison city of San Myshuno. The chapters went well, offering a near total recall of what made the series great to begin with. The client was impressed, and might bring {F0.her}{M0.him} back for the third in the series.
{0.SimName} volunteered as tribute, taking the task of writing about the scrappy group's struggles against the evil empire to heart. After no less than 451 pages of scorching wordsmithing, {F0.she}{M0.he} took the series in a brand new, darker direction. Having done so well, {F0.she}{M0.he} left room for the heroes' new hope, but the government will strike back. The client may yet ask {F0.her}{M0.him} to return for another chapter!
Not all writing is gold. {0.SimName}'s approaches to enhance the story didn't make the cut. Their notes suggest that adding an abundance of pop-culture references don't make it more dystopian, but {F0.she}{M0.he} won't be discouraged. There's always the next gig, and the next series reboot.
City Hall officials are in unanimous agreement that {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed mural is the winner and will soon be created in the Main Street district. They've taken the step of installing an honorary plaque on a nearby bench bearing {M0.his}{F0.her} name.
City Hall officials are in such love with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposal for the Main Street district mural, that in addition to giving {M0.him}{F0.her} a bonus payment, they've taken the extraordinary step of renaming Main Street to {0.SimName} Boulevard!
City Hall officials are disappointed that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to complete a proposal for a Main Street district in time. {M0.He}{F0.She} received a partial payment for completing a portion of the gig's goals.
{0.SimFirstName} strode into City Hall with {M0.his}{F0.her} proposed electrical box art, looking forward to the opportunity to present {M0.his}{F0.her} vision for artwork on every city street corner. The reality was decidedly less exciting, as a government employee momentarily glanced at {0.SimFirstName}'s proposal before handing over a check. Oh well, at least the pay was good!
The city council board was radiating excitement over {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed electrical box art! They were effusive with their praise, and even the mayor {M0.herself}{F0.himself} shook {0.SimFirstName}'s hand in a photo op for the press.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the submission process for the city's electrical box art program by the required deadline. As expected with any government contract though, {M0.he}{F0.she} still collected a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} expected payment.
The Sims Transportation Administration is pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed airport terminal mural. On top of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay, they gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a coupon to skip the security line on {M0.his}{F0.her} next flight.
The Sims Transportation Administration is thrilled with the mural that {0.SimFirstName} proposed, and can't wait until its brought to life within the airport terminal. Not only did {M0.he}{F0.she} earn bonus pay, but they all chipped in to buy {0.SimFirstName} a lifetime pass to the airport's first class lounge - how swanky!
The Sims Transportation Administration is unhappy that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the gig's requirements within the allotted time. {M0.He}{F0.She} received some pay for the partial work completed, but don't be surprised if {M0.he}{F0.she} gets pulled out of the security line for a &quot;random&quot; pat down next time {M0.he}{F0.she} takes a flight.
You've done very well. Our users did not seem to notice a difference between your proofreading and the Alpha tests run by our A.I. development group.
Our customer satisfaction score has increased by 10 points just from your hire. You've done so well that we are rethinking our investment in AI grammar correction. We've got a new idea to disrupt this industry. A app that instantly connects you with trained proofreaders. We will just take a modest cut of the profits.
When we asked you to proofread user submission for grammar errors. Instead you replaced all emotional adjectives with emoji's, and failed to complete the full breadth of your assigned tasks.. Please do not apply here again.
&quot;Thanks for all you're help! While I didn't get my dream job, I ended up with a full time position as Pneumatic Device and Machine Optimizer which will get me the experience I need to land my dream in a year or two! PS. I just realized that my position is just a fancy way of saying factory worker...&quot;
&quot;I can't thank you enough, with you're help I landed the job! Finally I can spend my days as a Teddy Bear Surgeon helping heal all the well loved plushies of the world. P.S. I'm also taking classes to help woth my spelling. Really got to work on that.&quot;
&quot;What happened? the deadline for submiting applications passed and I had to go with what I already had. Hopefully not having a second pear of eye on my work won't hurt my chances.&quot;
“{0.SimFirstName}, with your help the thesis was submitted error-free. Now we wait for the eggheads to determine if the research merits me receiving the title of “Doctor”. Hopefully, they don’t get stuck on the failed study into turning ants into viable arena gladiators for entertainment purposes. Don’t know how Steve convinced me they were a good idea. I really don’t.” 
“Due to your impeccable eye for the smallest of spelling infractions and my years of studying chemically attracted Formicidae, my team and I have been awarded with the prestigious Kroncke Award for Biology. Guess what? That means we’re published, and I'll be receiving that doctorate. See that Dad, you said I wasn’t smart enough! Look at me now!” \n Along with the contract's payment, the client included a bonus for the extra effort {0.SimFirstName} put in.
“Hey, deadline’s passed. Got the ants to do some of the proofreading before submitting the paper since I never heard back from you. Just hoping they didn’t modify my notes to put them in a better light when I wasn’t looking. Payment for you time included.”
With {M0.her}{F0.his} dying breath, the octogenarian transferred the agreed upon payment to {0.SimFirstName}'s account. Seems like {0.SimFirstName} finished the portrait just in the nick of time? RIP to them; hopefully their family enjoys the painting.
{0.SimFirstName} submitted what could only be described as a stunning likeness of {M0.his}{F0.her} client, who was said to be so pleased that they hopped out of their deathbed and burst into an impromptu smustle. Pleasing an octogenarian has its benefits; the client included an extra bonus payment for a job well done.
{0.SimFirstName}'s procrastination in completing the portrait gig did not pay off. It would seem the client passed away while waiting for {0.SimFirstName} to complete {M0.his}{F0.her} work. An estate lawyer did transfer a portion of the gig's payment for the work that {0.SimFirstName} did manage to complete.
The client was pleased to see the portrait of a departed loved one rendered so faithfully by {0.SimFirstName}. The restless spirit in question seemed quite appreciative as well, as {M0.she}{F0.he} popped out of {M0.her}{F0.his} urn to give a nod of approval. 
The client began to openly weep on receipt of the portrait... {0.SimFirstName} created such a lifelike rendering of their recently departed loved one, that they immediately felt a close bond to the painting. In fact, they swear that the eyes in the painting follow them each time they walk by. It's hard to put a price on what's sure to be a treasured item in the client's family, but they managed to do just that, when they expressed their thanks by paying {0.SimFirstName} a nice bonus on top of the portrait's agreed upon price.
A cold chill ran through {0.SimFirstName}'s body, as the deadline for completing the portrait came and went. It seems the spirit realm is unhappy with {M0.his}{F0.her} lack of commitment to aiding in the remembrance of a family's loved one.
The politician is quite pleased with the portrait {0.SimFirstName} created, and even expunged some jaywalking fines from {0.SimFirstName}'s record as a small sign of thanks.
A beautifully rendered portrait may just be the start of something bigger for {0.SimFirstName}... The politician is so pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} work that {M0.she's}{F0.he's} promised to share {0.SimFirstName}'s name to other up and coming public servants who need their own portraits painted. {M0.She}{F0.He} even diverted a little bonus from a slush fund {0.SimFirstName}'s way!
The politician is pretty unhappy that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the assigned tasks by the agreed upon time. {M0.She'll}{F0.He'll} never admit it, but a proposal {M0.she}{F0.he} introduced to slash the public art budget seemed like a clear retaliatory response to {0.SimFirstName}'s lackadaisical approach to {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
Writing a by the numbers, literal interpretation of the events and thoughts the guru spoke to, {0.SimFirstName} completed the work to light praise.
{0.SimFirstName} took notes, writing down the events of the guru's experiences and thoughts on inner peace. A little bit of enlightenment must have rubbed off on {F0.her}{M0.him} because the client was very happy with the results.
{0.SimFirstName} just sort of wrote whatever came to mind during the long periods of silence when working with the guru. Finding the results unsatisfactory, the client suggested that {F0.she}{M0.he} find their peace and happiness elsewhere, paying a portion of the agreed amount.
“This partnership has been rather satisfactory. Normally, I dread dealing directly with dolti… the general public. The Scientific Research Publication should be shipping out our work in the next few weeks and expect it to become a standard text-book in my field.”
“Exemplary! it’s almost like writing for nitwi… non-scientific individuals is your calling. I must say, translating the absence of privileged reference frames in general relativity into something palatable for a five-year old must be some sort of cabalistic gift! Next time I’m in need of a writer, I’ll be sure to reach out. Oh, I’ve included something extra for your marvelous work.”
Failing to meet the project deadline, {0.SimFirstName} got a heavily self-censored email from their irate client. Seems the deadline was to get the work published and missing this has greatly affected the client’s standing in the scientific community. Though {0.SimFirstName} got paid for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, it wasn’t the full contracted amount.
{0.SimFirstName} took the draft and corrected it, fixing the portions that were written in stream-of-consciousness, fixing the perspective from second to third, and turning the first-person lines into quotes. {F0.She}{M0.He} still isn't sure {F0.she}{M0.he} understands the philosophical implications, but the client is happy!
{0.SimFirstName} reworked the drafts, tied the ideas together, and maybe learned a little about the philosophy of perspective and existence! The client was very, very pleased with himself. Or pleased with {0.SimFirstName}, depending on perspective.
Unable to make heads or tails of who the client was talking about as it went from first, to third, back to second-perspective in his writings, the contract was canceled out of frustration. A paltry sum of simoleons was still paid out however.
&quot;Did you remember to go over &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the notes?&quot; the client asked over and over. After reading through the drafts and finalizing the text book, the schools happily distribute the new text book.
The client is elated with the history text book, and so are the schools it'll be used in. Grades across the district are up, test scores are improving, and the students have a new appreciation for history. {0.SimFirstName} didn't just do a good job, they helped society remember where they came from!
{0.SimFirstName} didn't write a text book so much as a stream of consciousness manuscript. The client makes a note of how it feels more like an opinion piece, and politely thanks {F0.her}{M0.him} for their help, but explains they will take it from here.
Slater Publishing was happy with the narrative {0.SimFirstName} provided. A solid crime thriller with a compelling protagonist. Now {0.SimFirstName} just needed to wait for the story to be published to see how much the masses enjoyed the mystery.
The case was closed; Sleuths and Scofflaws had their cover story. The narrative was inventive; the criminal inspired. Now was time for silent reflection and a juice, straight. Suddenly, a notification appeared on the screen the author kept in the corner of {F0.her}{M0.his} eye. With a single press of a button the notice illuminated the virtual landscape before them. Gratuity from Slater Publishing, most appreciated, told of a client well satisfied. In a post script, an ask to delve into another conundrum. But {0.SimFirstName} needed {F0.her}{M0.his} rest. Time to calm the mind before burrowing back into the muck and grime of another investigation.
The deadline passed, the criminal got away and the client pulled the plug. Though {0.SimFirstName} was compensated for {F0.her}{M0.his} time with the investigation, {F0.she}{M0.he} didn’t feel satisfied. The puzzle was incomplete, the tale went cold. Surly it couldn’t stop here! But it would, and {0.SimFirstName} would have to return to their other mundane writings for now. For even the best sometimes get lost in the fog.
The caper and the crime have been committed; {0.SimFirstName} sent off the manuscript and the client thought it was a &quot;good start,&quot; and are happy with what {F0.she}{M0.he} crafted for them.
The series is selling so well it feels like stealing. {0.SimFirstName} received a series of accolades and more than a few quirked eyebrows wondering if {F0.she}{M0.he} has been thinking about how to build {F0.her}{M0.his} criminal empire long before taking this gig...
The only crime committed here is the writing, or so the client says. {0.SimFirstName}'s initial drafts were found wanting. {F0.She}{M0.He} will still get paid for the first part of the contract, but has been asked not to contrive any other capers for them at the moment.
{0.SimFirstName} searched and searched, studying the sheet music and finding the names of the companies that distributed it. Turning over all the same stones previous investigations did, {F0.she}{M0.he} didn't manage to find any new information, but did present it in a new way.
{0.SimFirstName} wrote a treatise on the song, analyzing the harmonic patterns, checking to see if the notes spelled any words, and digging through so many old files. The public responded well to {F0.her}{M0.his} findings, riveted by every word -- even though it raised more questions than it answered.
The client mysteriously ended the contract with {0.SimFirstName} after the first outline was sent off. With no feedback, {F0.she}{M0.he} thinks it best to let the mystery rest for now. At least {F0.she}{M0.he} got a small paycheck out of it.
{0.SimFirstName} got a good review on the motivational book, the client calling it &quot;more than adequate&quot; as {F0.she}{M0.he} helped push it over the finish line.
&quot;Oh wow, why didn't I think of this? It's brilliant! I'm going to go start my next book right now!&quot; the client said of the writing {0.SimFirstName} did in helping finish the motivational book. Having inspired the motivational speaker to take the next steps, the book itself does very well!
Upon reading the draft work {0.SimFirstName} had been working on, the client found themselves compelled to complete the book on their own. In this way, {0.SimFirstName} inspired and motivated someone... just at the expense of the contract. {F0.She}{M0.He} will be compensated for the work they've done so far, however.
Upon reformatting the last of the client’s incoherent thoughts on employment, {0.SimFirstName} submitted the final draft and sat back. Almost immediately, the client messaged back, pleased with the overall work. Once they finished reading everything over once more the book would be off to the publisher and then into the hands of the masses. {0.SimFirstName} was about to influence many to reach for their dreams of being self-employed.
“This book hits the nail on the head! People really needed to not only learn to see the opportunities around them but also understand the problems they’d face pursuing their new path of self-employment! For all your work, I’m giving you a cut of the signing bonus the publisher offered. You’re the embodiment of my philosophy on self-employment. It’s almost like you took all my ideas to heart.”
“I don’t think you’re cut out for this ‘Self-Employed’ craze I’m about to bring to the world. You didn’t follow steps four through seven yourself, failing to meet the goals we set. Just remember steps twenty nine and seventy two {0.SimFirstName}, they’ll help you bounce back from this setback but only if you put your mind to it. I’m forwarding pay for what you did finish; it will help me inspire someone better suited to motivating themselves.”
The mod was delivered, and after a bit of testing and verification, released to the community. High fives all around! Well, virtual high fives, since everyone works remotely. The modding group thanked {0.SimFirstName} for {F0.her}{M0.his} help and continued their vacations. Now about that missing modder...
The mod was very timely delivered. The modding group was so relieved that they gave {0.SimFirstName} a bit extra! Now everyone can enjoy their vacations in peace. Sort of. Unfortunately, the missing modder still hasn't been heard from...
{0.SimFirstName} didn't give the modding group anything complete, but they still gave a small portion of the promised pay out of good will. They said something about modders needing to support each other. What a nice bunch!
It sure is a mod... for a game... Yep. With all the criteria satisfied, {0.SimFirstName} received the promised payment. The organizers couldn't help but express a little disappointment at the bugginess of the mod, but it was a tight deadline after all.
Well, that was quite fast. The organizers complimented {0.SimFirstName} on a speedy delivery, claiming it's rare that such a quickly made mod works so seamlessly with the original game. Apparently, that's worth a bonus! Where do they get all this money...?
Well, they did say they would pay anyone that participates. Even late and unfinished, the organizers gave {0.SimFirstName} the &quot;You Tried Prize&quot; as they called it. Where &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; they getting this money?
The client knew what they wanted, and {0.SimFirstName} gave it to them. It was drowned out by the other 20 games that company released at around the same time, but {F0.she}{M0.he} still got paid.
The client knew exactly what they wanted, and {0.SimFirstName} delivered. The result was fantastic, and earned a top spot in that company's hall of fame. This earned {F0.her}{M0.him} a hefty bonus!
Surprisingly, the client was not upset at all that {0.SimFirstName} failed to deliver. According to the representative, the company has hundreds of these projects going all the time, expecting a few to drop here and there. A prorated amount was paid to thank {0.SimFirstName} for {F0.her}{M0.his} time. Business as usual, it seems.
The game was delivered on time, much to the appreciation of the client. They've been expecting everything to go wrong, like they always do. {0.SimFirstName} is happy for {F0.him}{M0.her} but really wishes that {F0.he}{M0.she} would stop asking to be friends.
The client was very nice, and intensely driven. They had a complete launch plan ready, with soft launches and marketing beats. So when {0.SimFirstName} delivered the game ahead of schedule, the entrepreneur almost didn't know what to do. After a bit of freaking out, they added a bonus to the final payment.
The client was very disappointed that {0.SimFirstName} had nothing to show. Apparently, they are running low on funds as it is. Still, the client gave a small percentage of the pay hoping that the good deed will mean things will turn around for them soon.
As soon as {0.SimFirstName} sent the finished app over, {F0.she}{M0.he} started receiving stickers from the client. It was fun at first, but the constant flow of reaction GIFs and emotes is getting very tiring. At least the pay was nice.
{0.SimFirstName} delivered the app so fast, the client was able time it with the release of a highly anticipated new phone. This pushed downloads through the roof! The client decided to share a bit of the initial profits with {0.SimFirstName} a nice bonus.
&quot;We could be sending each other smiley faces and animated hugs right now!&quot;\n\n{0.SimFirstName} received some very angry text messages about failing to deliver. Then, possibly fearing the messages would be publicized, the company representative sent an apology and a small portion of the contract pay.
A dating app isn't the easiest piece of software to make, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to get it done on time. The company representative was delighted for a while, but then learned that their significant other has started using it... Best look the other way.
The dating world has just been rocked. The client insists that {0.SimFirstName} is the Cupid of modern society, whatever that means. No matter, {F0.she}{M0.he} received more than the agreed payment, so no complaints!
It appears that the one most disappointed by the failure to create a dating app was the partner of the one that put up the job posting. Who also turned out to be the president of the company. {0.SimFirstName} was paid a percentage of the contract amount out of spite.
{0.SimFirstName}'s product slogan proved to be &quot;just what the doctor ordered&quot;, according to the marketing exec. That poor exec seems stuck in the past, a relic of the pre-digital age. {0.SimFirstName} can't imagine that marketing firm will be around much longer, but their money is still good for now, at least.
The marketing execs are impressed at {0.SimFirstName}'s modern take on marketing copy. Not only did they decide to use the slogan {M0.he}{F0.she} ultimately submitted, but they think there's a lot of value in the off the cuff ideas {M0.he}{F0.she} dropped in their initial discussion... So much so, that they've decided to pay {M0.him}{F0.her} an additional bonus!
The marketing exec accused {0.SimFirstName} of lollygagging, as the submission deadline for the requested marketing copy had come and gone. Still, the exec was a {M0.woman}{F0.man} of {M0.her}{F0.his} word, and tossed {0.SimFirstName} some clams for the partial work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} managed to complete.
The marketing intern expressed {M0.her}{F0.his} thanks and gratitude. {0.SimFirstName}'s work on the magazine campaign arrived just in the nick of time; saving the intern from an embarrassing dismissal from {M0.her}{F0.his} temporary position at the firm.
&quot;{0.SimFirstName} this ad campaign is brilliant! Way better than my original scratch 'n sniff idea. The client was thrilled, my boss was satisfied... Best of all, the firm offered me a full time job! You're talking to a Marketing Assistant I now! I'm so grateful... here, take my signing bonus as an extra thank you.!&quot;
While {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the agreed upon work on time, the intern that'd secretly hired {M0.him}{F0.her} had a failure of {M0.her}{F0.his} own... The intern's boss discovered that {M0.she'd}{F0.he'd} outsourced {M0.her}{F0.his} work, and immediately booted {M0.her}{F0.him} from the firm's office. Thankfully, the marketing firm ended up having to pay {0.SimFirstName} a prorated amount for the work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} done to avoid infringing upon labor laws.
&quot;Oh honey, you did &lt;i&gt;so well&lt;/i&gt; on that newspaper ad! No seriously, &lt;i&gt;good job&lt;/i&gt;! It's really impressive in this day and age to find people still committed to working in a print medium. Here's your money; ta-ta!&quot;
&quot;Hmph. Even I, a digital copy editor, have to admit that you did a bang up job on that newspaper ad copy {0.SimFirstName}. Look, this doesn't change anything... print advertisement is still on the way out. With work like that though, my bosses may force me to keep contracting print freelancers for awhile longer. Ugh, just take your bonus and get out of here.&quot;
&quot;Hah, I knew you'd fail to get the gig completely finished on time. The world has moved past print ads, and it's clearly moved past you. Here... have this pittance for the work that you put in, but know that I'm just taking pity on you.&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} gave the client a ring, to let them know {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} completed {M0.his}{F0.her} work. They seemed to be in a hurry, only briefly glancing at {0.SimFirstName}'s updated copy before giving their approval. After receiving a swift payment, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to move on to {M0.his}{F0.her} next gig.
{0.SimFirstName} blitzed through the gig's tasks, churning out some hip marketing copy at record speed. Remarkably, a bunch of irreverent, adventurous, confident, and chill sims started engaging with the brand on Simstagram, sharing their approval of the refreshed product page. Success! The client was thrilled with {0.SimFirstName}'s work, and in addition to a monetary bonus, {M0.she}{F0.he} promised to treat {0.SimFirstName} to a chili dog meal if {M0.he's}{F0.she's} ever in the area. Strange...
The client called {0.SimFirstName}, clearly upset that {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} missed {M0.his}{F0.her} deadline for completing the gig's required tasks. {0.SimFirstName} could hear them chuckling on the other end of the line; surely an attempt to suppress their anger in the face of {0.SimFirstName}'s failure. Through clenched teeth, they remarked that {0.SimFirstName} would be paid for the portion of work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} completed, but the underlying message was clear... &lt;i&gt;&quot;Don't call back; don't waste our time again.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
{0.SimFirstName}'s proposed product logo has managed to achieve perfect brand synergy with the client's other offerings. That's no small feat! The client is happy to have retained {0.SimFirstName}'s services, and will keep {M0.him}{F0.her} in mind for future projects.
{0.SimFirstName}'s product logo is having a strange unintended affect... Test subje... ahem; Consumers are feeling a sudden and strong emotional bond to the brand, and without any prompting are taking it upon themselves to evangelize the product to other Sims. This fascinating development has the client thrilled, and they've kicked over a bonus payment {0.SimFirstName}'s way.
Boxes of the client's product are languishing on store shelves, as the generic branding is failing to resonate with modern consumers. This could have been avoided, had {0.SimFirstName} not missed the deadline to complete all of {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks. Thankfully, the contract clearly stated that {0.SimFirstName} must be compensated for the partial time {M0.he}{F0.she} did spend on the project.
The client was beyond impressed that {0.SimFirstName} was able to craft a compelling logo that'd be sure to carry the company forward into our bold Web 4.0 future. Truth be told, {0.SimFirstName} just painted the company's name in Helvetica font... but whatever, they seem happy.
The client was stunned when {0.SimFirstName} delivered a brand new logo that it looked like it could last all the way into a Web 5.0 world. What an accomplishment! They heralded {0.SimFirstName} as an artistic luminary, showered {M0.him}{F0.her} with a bonus payment, and insisted that {M0.he}{F0.she} give a motivational speech at the company's next town hall meeting.
The company's CEO is upset... {0.SimFirstName} was given a clear deadline to complete all of the tasks needed to craft a logo, and {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't come through. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} fortunate to have still received a partial payment after leaving the company with such an outdated logo in a rapidly moving Web 3.0 world.
{0.SimFirstName}'s sleek new company logo is making the client's business the talk of Sillisim Valley. No doubt venture capital firms will soon be in touch with funding offers. Watching the company's market cap skyrocket from the sidelines will be bittersweet, but at least {0.SimFirstName} got paid, and added some highly visible work to {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio.
The executive had to admit the {0.SimFirstName} did a fantastic job with the company's new logo, as venture capital firms had already started to beat down their headquarters doors with funding offers. While still refusing to offer any stock grants, {M0.she}{F0.he} acquiesced and sent {0.SimFirstName} a sizable bonus check.
{0.SimFirstName} missed the deadline to complete a new logo for the Sillisim Valley startup company that hired {0.SimPronounObjective}, and the company's angel investor is NOT happy. Oh well, it's not {0.SimFirstName}'s problem... That is, unless {M0.he}{F0.she} ever decides to switch freelancer trades and try {M0.his}{F0.her} hand at programming.
{0.SimFirstName} managed to get the last of the requested icons submitted, just as the clock ticked down to zero on the icon lock milestone. Good news - on top of the gig's payment, {0.SimFirstName}'s time spent on the project was just enough to ensure {M0.his}{F0.her} name is included in the game's credits. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} an official game dev now!
Squee! The studio's art director is head over heels in love with the game icons that {0.SimFirstName} created. They're. So. CUTE! Not only have they paid {M0.him}{F0.her} an added bonus for the top-notch work, but they decided to confer {M0.him}{F0.her} with honorary SimGuru status.
Uh oh - {0.SimFirstName} missed the icon lock milestone, and the project has a strict schedule to stick to. Thankfully, the game already has a rich pool of existing icons to draw from and reuse, but this certainly reflects poorly on {0.SimFirstName}'s professionalism. At least {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} still collect partial pay for the portion of work {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to complete.
{0.SimFirstName}'s app icon arrived to the team just in time for their mobile launch, and they unanimously agreed that {0.SimFirstName} nailed it. It wasn't long before {0.SimFirstName} started noticing more and more sims around town with their faces buried in their phones... Can this blight upon society be traced back to {M0.his}{F0.her} irresistible iconography? Oh well, at least the money was good.
The dev team's plans seemed ambitious, but with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed icon being put to use, their app's install base has skyrocketed upwards! Daily active users are off the charts! Engagement metrics are reaching unheard of levels! Even lapsed users are returning in droves, excited to be a part of this new digital sensation! The app's devs are likely out purchasing sports cars, yachts, mansions... whatever it is that rich people do... but they were nice enough to tell their accountant to kick a bonus {0.SimFirstName}'s way.
{0.SimFirstName} was unable to complete all of the required tasks in time, and the app's dev team missed their launch window. Absolute market saturation was &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; achieved. This app that was once destined for greatness, now faces an uphill battle just to claw its way back to the mobile store's front page. Still, {0.SimFirstName} managed to wrangle a partial payment for the time {M0.he}{F0.she} invested into the project.
Unsure about the job, {0.SimFirstName} completed the tasks while second guessing every word and action. It wasn't speedy, but it was done on time. The Simstagram representative thanked {F0.her}{M0.him} for the work and promised that more will come if {F0.she}{M0.he} wanted it. {0.SimFirstName} isn't so sure...
Simstagram may be cruel, but they're fair. Possibly motivated by the thinly veiled threat, {0.SimFirstName} finished the job in record time. {F0.She}{M0.He} was rewarded with a very decent amount of extra pay. It's almost worth the worry!
Simstagram was furious with the failure. {0.SimFirstName} tried to appeal to the company by complimenting how incredible their security was, but to no avail. Partial pay was given for the time spent, but {F0.she}{M0.he} couldn't shake the foreboding feeling that something bad is in store for {F0.her}{M0.him}.
{0.SimFirstName} delivered the report on time, much to the relief of the Landgraab representative. Apparently Landgraab receives over 150 attacks a day. It's hard to imagine that level of stress!
The representative from Landgraab was overjoyed at the quick delivery of the security report. They kept repeating that it was exactly what the company needed. {0.SimFirstName} wasn't so sure, but can't complain about the bonus given to {F0.her}{M0.him}.
The contact from Landgraab had a panic attack after being told that the job was not done in time. {0.SimFirstName} helped {0.SimPronounObjective} calm down by reassuring {0.SimPronounObjective} that {F0.she}{M0.he} was not going to lose {F0.her}{M0.his} job. As thanks, the contact allowed {0.SimFirstName} to keep a portion of the payment, but still filed a complaint.
{0.SimFirstName}'s report was answered with a very confusingly redacted email. It's a wonder how the NSSA operates with so much information missing in every message, but it doesn't matter as long as the payment goes through.
The completion of the job ahead of schedule was met with a heavily redacted email that somehow still had a very happy and excited tone. It's a wonder how the NSSA operates with so much information missing in every message, but at least extra payment can't be covered up!
After the deadline passed and {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} was sent a heavily redacted email. It was easy to tell the sender was upset, and the blanks seemed to only be covering adjectives instead of sensitive information... {0.SimFirstName} received a small payment for {F0.her}{M0.his} services.
The excitable representative loved the report that {0.SimFirstName} gave, and wouldn't stop praising {F0.her}{M0.him}. It was flattering at first, but it went on for far too long. After what seemed like an eternity, {F0.she}{M0.he} finally received the payment.
The contact from Bubbleplace reached impressive levels of excitement when {0.SimFirstName} completed {F0.her}{M0.his} report ahead of time. They went on and on about how impressive engineers are, which was flattering at first, but quickly became arduous. Still, {0.SimFirstName} received a nice bonus for {F0.her}{M0.his} efforts.
The contact from Bubbleplace seemed all too cheerful when {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the contract. Apparently, they considered it success in a way, thinking it just proved their security systems are that tough. They thanked {F0.her}{M0.him} for taking the time with a small payment.
The company might be shady, but they pay well. {0.SimFirstName} can't complain after receiving the paycheck, though {F0.she}{M0.he} can't get that strange feeling out of {F0.her}{M0.his} head that {F0.she}{M0.he} is seeing more spam mail...
Chain Mail, Inc. might seem a bit strange and shady, but they are very generous. When {0.SimFirstName} delivered {F0.her}{M0.his} report ahead of schedule, the company made sure to reward {0.SimPronounObjective} with a little extra payment.
Even though, {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} was still paid a portion of the agreed amount. The real punishment came later, when {F0.her}{M0.his} inbox was suddenly filled with spam mail.
{0.SimFirstName} delivered the report on time, much to the relief of the Llamacorn representative. Apparently, even as {F0.she}{M0.he} was working on the gig, Llamacorn received over 200 attacks!
The contact at Llamacorn was thrilled with the early report delivery. {0.SimFirstName} received a good bit more pay than {F0.she}{M0.he} was expecting, but no complaints here!
{0.SimFirstName}'s contact at Llamacorn became very suspicious of {0.SimPronounObjective} when told the job was not completed. In a hurry, {F0.she}{M0.he} was paid a small amount, thanked for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, and digitally shoved out the door.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forged painting is a true delight for the shady collector, who immediately hung it in a prominent position above {M0.her}{F0.his} fireplace. Hey, whatever makes them happy - as long as {0.SimFirstName} gets paid.
After submitting the forged painting, the true brilliance of the art collector's scheme came to light. The collector wasn't interested in adding {0.SimFirstName}'s painting to {M0.her}{F0.his} own personal collection... No, the collector was stealing the original, and replacing it with {0.SimFirstName}'s forged copy. {0.SimFirstName} was initially alarmed at the risk of being caught, but some extra hush money from the collector got {M0.him}{F0.her} to look the other way, for now...
The shady art collector is furious that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks on time. After threatening to tip off the authorities though, {0.SimFirstName} was still able to extract a partial payment for the time {M0.he}{F0.she} put in, which only seems fair.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forgery was convincing enough to allow the shady art dealer to quickly complete a sale to an all-too-eager collector, before too many questions could be asked.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forgery was immaculate; {M0.he}{F0.she} nailed every aspect of the recreation which could possibly be scrutinized. The dealer's customer brought in an independent expert to review the painting, who unwittingly authenticated it. The entire operation was an incredible success, and the dealer paid {0.SimFirstName} a handsome bonus - or maybe that was simply hush money?
Parties can be tricky affairs-sometimes fancy, sometimes casual, sometimes canceled-which is why we created the perfect ensemble for any party that actually exists.

{1.SimFirstName} and I just welcomed home our new baby! Are you able to stop by?
I have some exciting news {0.SimFirstName}! {1.SimFirstName} and I just had our baby; would you be up for coming over and saying hello?
A stork left us a gift! Totally joking, but {1.SimFirstName} and I did just bring home our baby. Come visit if you're free!
{0.SimFirstName}! It's official, I'm a parent of the wonderful toddler I adopted. Are you free for an introduction?
I'm the parent of a newly adopted toddler, {0.SimFirstName}! I'm so excited, but also very nervous. If you have any spare time would you want to come by?

Hey, {0.SimFirstName}, it's me, {1.SimFirstName}. I don't know about you, but I felt like we had an instant connection... Can I take you out to my favorite place?
{2.SimFirstName} is such a jerk, you were right about {M2.him}{F2.her}.
{1.SimFirstName} and I have a little bun in the oven. I can't describe to you how excited I am to be having a baby!
{0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that I'm pregnant! {1.SimFirstName} and I will be expecting a little one soon!
Baby News! {1.SimFirstName} and I are pregnant, and I wanted to make sure you heard it from me first.
Thanks, I'll call him Lewis
Major Sancho to Ground Control! It's good to see you, Nova. By the way, I brought you a Space Slug from Sixam. Isn't he cute? It's the perfect pet, you don't even have to feed him! He's very gassy, though...
Yes - Cash is trash!
No - I worked so hard to get here!
I've had the best idea! We understand each other and we work well as a... team, right? What if we created our own game or app together and became indie developers? No one could fire us ever again! Come on, {0.SimFirstName}? Let’s stick it to the man! I'll share with you the secret beverage I use to boost performance. If you start coding right after you drink this, you'll level your programming skill in no time!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I hope you’re not working too hard! Remember to use some of those precious vacation days to chill!
Thanks for allowing me to crash at your place, {0.SimFirstName}. I got you this Space Print as an apology for being a jerk. It reminded me of the night we spent at your dad's observatory... Not that I think about it often or anything. Place it near your computer and activate it, it will help you boost your programming skill gain! And again, sorry for being a supercompetitive tuna head.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! Guess what, I got promoted too! I used my bonus to buy furniture and MADE. IT. RAIN. I got lots of flashy new items that will quickly get me into a good mood so I’ll have EVEN MORE time for career advancement. Smart, huh? You gotta spend money to make money! I gotta admit, I’m surprised you were promoted as well… Must’ve been luck! When I’m your manager I’ll make sure mistakes like that don’t happen again.\n&#xD;&#xA;
I'll buy stuff with my bonus too!
Should I trust &quot;The New Lewis&quot;?
Grrr, stop self-inviting yourself!
Learned to Creep
After learning to roll over in both directions, continued practice with &lt;b&gt;Tummy Time&lt;/b&gt; will help {0.SimFirstName} build muscle and increase coordination to allow {0.SimPronounObjective} to start creeping.
Watch out world, {0.SimFirstName} is on the loose! Having learned to crawl, there's no shortage of mischief {0.SimPronounSubjective}'ll be able to get up to.
Learned to Crawl
The world just got a bit brighter with {0.SimFirstName}'s very first smile!
First Smiled
Ah, the sweet sound of silence. Those living with {0.SimFirstName} will never forget the first time {0.SimPronounSubjective} finally slept a full rest without interruption.
Slept Through the Night
{0.SimFirstName} will never know it happened, but {1.SimName} will surely remember the first time {1.SimPronounSubjective} got peed on while changing {0.SimFirstName}'s diaper.
Peed on Caregiver
{0.SimFirstName} uttered {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} very first word! Write that down!
{0.SimFirstName} went on a trip to {3.String} to visit {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} relatives.
First Visit to a Family Member's Home
A new face! {0.SimFirstName} had {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} first encounter meeting someone from outside {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} household.
First Visitors
{0.SimFirstName} traveled to {3.String} for {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} very first vacation. Hopefully the first of many because {0.SimFirstName} could get used to this lifestyle!
First Vacation
The world got a little bigger for {0.SimFirstName} when {0.SimPronounSubjective} visited a park for the first time!
{0.SimFirstName} went on an adventure to {3.String}.
First Trip to a Park
First Baby Food

Bubbles bubbles bubbles! {0.SimFirstName} loved {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} very first bubble bath from {1.SimName}! 
First Bubble Bath

First Diaper Blowout
{0.SimFirstName} was squeaky clean after receiving {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} first ever bath from {1.SimName}.

Aww, it looks like {0.SimFirstName} is starting to open up to other Sims! Let it be known that {1.SimName} is the first Sim that {0.SimFirstName} waved to.
Learned to Wave
{0.SimFirstName} is getting stronger every day. What a momentous occasion when {0.SimPronounSubjective} can wiggle around, bend over, and even stick {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} toe in {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} mouth. How flexible!
Put Toe In Mouth
Playing with toybox toys, dollhouses, blocks, and the Infant Playmat will help {0.SimFirstName} progress through {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} Fine Motor milestones!
Aim high and reach far! {0.SimFirstName} first reached for the {2.ObjectName}, but the sky's the limit! Who knows what {0.SimPronounSubjective} will reach for next?
Learned to Reach
Using the Infant Playmat to &lt;b&gt;Look At Toys&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Play With Infant&lt;/b&gt; will eventually lead to {0.SimFirstName} reaching for things all on {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} own!
{0.SimFirstName}'s powerful fingers are now able to perform the Pincer Grasp! Nothing will escape from {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} fingers unless {0.SimPronounSubjective} wills it!
Learned Pincer Grasp
{0.SimFirstName}'s tiny but strong hands were able to grab and hold on tight to {2.ObjectName}! {0.SimPronounSubjective|xxUpper} is holding on so tightly; it makes one wonder if {0.SimPronounSubjective} will ever let go!
Learned to Grab
Giving {0.SimFirstName} toys and using the Playmat will strengthen {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} hands and eventually allow {0.SimPronounObjective} to grab things on {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} own!
{0.SimFirstName} made {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} first sounds with {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} hands!
Learned to Clap
This wild animal has recently received a gift. Try again tomorrow.

Mega Column (Budget DeLite)
We were admiring the use of straight lines in mission-style design, and someone said “Hey, you know what’s really straight? Columns!” So we designed a series of columns. Here’s the Budget DeLite version for beginning column collectors.
Mega Column (Deluxe)
Are you prepared to start collecting columns with the big boys? Ready to take that next step? You will NEVER find another column that is both as straight and as round as this one. We know because we asked robots to design it. The Deluxe Mega Column: because you are seriously not messing around anymore.

Platforms are found in the Build catalog in the same section as Walls and Rooms. Customize your Platform Trims with options that can be found in the Walls and Empty Rooms Section.
Add a platform to any lot or room by placing one of the platform shapes provided in the catalog. Make a platform taller or sink a platform lower using the new “up” and “down” arrows present in the UI when a platform or room is selected. Platforms that are higher than one stair step need stairs or ladders in order to be accessed by Sims.
Move Whole Lot
The Move Lot tool can be found at the top tool bar under Move Lot and House.\n\nWhen the tool is selected, everything on the lot is grouped together and selected. A context menu provides options to pickup, rotate, and confirm placement.
The &quot;Move Whole Lot&quot; tool allows players to move and rotate the entire contents of a lot. This tool is helpful for lots placed from the Gallery as well as moving houses along any landscape. 
Portions of the lot can be positioned outside the lot boundary. Anything outside the lot boundary is highlighted yellow and will be not be placed. Objects removed from outside placement will be stored in the Household Inventory.
Community (Venue) Sort
In Build Mode, players can easily sort items needed for Venues using Venue Sorting. Under Objects by Function, the default drop down displays all objects that satisfy the specified venue type.
Of course - if you want to just see EVERYTHING - you can do that as well.
Players can also choose to only show Community items.  These objects are not required to be in venues, but are generic Venue items.
Basements
Since basements are set below terrain, you cannot place windows or doors along the outer walls of the basement.  Exterior walls also cannot be deleted.
Basements have a ton of new possibilities!  Create underground labyrinths, or   underground laboratories that are surrounded by pools.
Basements can be placed at ground level by using the Basement tool, or by moving the camera below-ground and placing rooms as normal.
Basements can be placed up to four levels deep. Floors and ceilings can also be removed. In order for Sims to access basements, make sure to place some stairs!
Basements can be placed as functional rooms below terrain level. In Build Mode, the basement tool can be found under Walls and Empty Rooms.
Use the Day/Night indicator to change the lighting in Build Mode in order to view your lot under different lighting conditions. The lighting does not persist when you exit Build Mode.
Once you get going in Build, you will want to familiarize yourself with the various tools that are available to make customizing your home easier. Eyedropper, Sledgehammer, Design Tool, Move House, Select, and Bulldoze Lot… to name a few.\n\nSo dig in, and start building!
Save to Gallery
To share your Room for other Sims players to view, click on the Share Room to the Gallery button.\n\nAfter your Room has been shared, you can add and remove comments, and share your lot to Facebook.
Use the Gallery to manage your saved Lots and Rooms by selecting the My Library tab, and clicking on your saved Lots and Rooms.\n\nFrom here, you can Share and un-Share your Rooms and Lots, Delete them from My Library, or Bring your Room or Lot into Build Mode to play with once again!
Saved Rooms can be found in the Gallery menu under the My Library tab, as well as in the Rooms and Walls build catalog sort by choosing the Saved Rooms sort.

It’s important to have a beat. {0.SimFirstName} didn’t actually have any knowledge of {M0.his}{F0.her} beat before {M0.he}{F0.she} started writing about it, but if you sound convincing, you are convincing. The readers will never catch on! The secret? Use lots of big words.
Regular Contributor
{M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} always thought of {M0.himself}{F0.herself} as a know-it-all, but now {0.SimFirstName} is a professional know-it-all. The life of an advice columnist is full of deranged in-laws, mailmen without personal boundaries, and secret second families. But only if {M0.he}{F0.she}’s lucky.   
Advice Columnist
Now {0.SimFirstName}’s working for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, writing what {M0.he}{F0.she} wants…or at least what paying clients want. Unfortunately, paying clients want articles about “10 Creative Ways to Eat Mushrooms” or “Hot Tips to Drive Your Dog Wild.” It’s not glamorous, but it’s a living!
Freelance Article Writer
It’s more important to write fast than to write well…does {0.SimFirstName} have what it takes? Bloggers only get paid if they get clicks, so {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} better study the things people like to click on. (Cat videos and numbered lists.) 
Blogger
{0.SimFirstName} is about to learn what it means to pay {M0.his}{F0.her} dues as an assistant-assistant coffee-getter, assistant fact-looker-upper, and assistant paperwork-filer. After a while, {M0.he}{F0.she} may even get to do some writing, although {M0.his}{F0.her} boss will take the credit. 
Writer's Assistant
{0.SimFirstName} has transcended day-to-day news and now spends {M0.his}{F0.her} time looking backward…studying what has been, and what it all means. Future generations will study {M0.his}{F0.her} works, and many more will use them as very fancy doorstops. 
Scribe of History
{M0.He}{F0.She} decides which stories run and which get killed. {M0.He}{F0.She} keeps circulation up and costs down. {M0.He}{F0.She} produces amazing journalism, and if {M0.he}{F0.she} could figure out how to make people actually pay for it, {M0.he}{F0.she}'d really have it made! 
Editor-in-Chief
If {M0.he}{F0.she}’s lucky, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} be the reporter who cracked the biggest scandal ever. Someone, somewhere is up to no good, and {0.SimFirstName}’s determined to find them. {0.SimFirstName} loves revealing wrongdoing and making the big money, not always in that order. 
Investigative Journalist
{M0.His}{F0.Her} crack reporting skills and snappy writing have landed {0.SimFirstName} a plum assignment covering breaking news. Toppling governments! Catastrophic natural disasters! A pop star with a new haircut! {0.SimFirstName}’s on the big stories now.

Municipal rezoning? Dog-catcher elections? The local beat isn’t always glamorous, but at least {0.SimFirstName} can use the power of {M0.his}{F0.her} job to crush {M0.his}{F0.her} enemies. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the best restaurant tables and the cleaners never shrink {M0.his}{F0.her} sweaters.

The hardest part about creating a sprawling, multi-volume fantasy epic? Thinking up all those crazy names like Cloydon DeBarboot and Frimzy Peppernoodle. Definitely the names. Oh, and also dealing with the really strange, inappropriate fanfic.
Creator of Worlds
Bestselling authors have a tough life-going from talk show to talk show, receiving honors, counting endless stacks of money-but {0.SimFirstName} has worked hard to join their ranks.

Bestselling Author
The fans love {0.SimPronounObjective}. The critics hate {0.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} might be churning out sub-literate dreck, but {M0.his}{F0.her} books sell like crazy, so {M0.his}{F0.her} publisher keeps paying {0.SimPronounObjective}. And that’s the real measure of literary success. Right?  
Fan Favorite
Most novelists don’t go crazy alone in deserted hotels in the winter. Most novelists don’t die penniless in the streets. Most novelists are happy, well-adjusted, and creatively satisfied people! {0.SimFirstName} keeps telling {M0.himself}{F0.herself} that....
Novelist
It’s not like {0.SimFirstName} can’t write longer stories, it’s just that {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t want to! Long stories are overrated. Who has the attention span for all that? And novels just end up getting adapted into movies anyway, and {0.SimFirstName}’s pretty busy already, so....
Short Story Writer
“Happy customers, healthy business!” At least, that’s what {0.SimFirstName}’s training manual says. {M0.He}{F0.She} might be earning a healthier wage, manning the support desk with a smile, but the only customers who get sent {M0.his}{F0.her} way are not happy, not at all.
Customer Support
{0.SimFirstName} has been promoted to Sales Floor Clerk! Now {M0.he}{F0.she} can interact directly with the customers and brush up on vital salesmanship skills! And between customers {M0.he}{F0.she} can sweep floors, scrape off gum, heft boxes and restock store displays.
Sales Floor Clerk
{0.SimFirstName} is ready to take {M0.his}{F0.her} part in the global economy. People need to buy things to make the economy happen, and that means that people need retailers to sell them things, and THAT means that someone needs to stock a bunch of shelves. Guess what {0.SimFirstName}’s part is?
Shelf Stocker
Every kid goes through a digging phase, but no tiny scoop and plastic pail on the beach can ever compare to the sheer awesomeness of breaking into the earth with a backhoe! This is a big promotion to operate a big machine, and {0.SimFirstName} is hoping the big responsibility will translate into big Simoleons!
Backhoe Operator
{0.SimFirstName} is working {M0.his}{F0.her} way up the ladder in the landscaping world, flexing not just {M0.his}{F0.her} muscles, but {M0.his}{F0.her} artistry as well. Sure, {0.SimFirstName} is mostly working off other people’s designs-planting, digging, raking, mowing-but every so often {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to make a fleeting mark on {M0.his}{F0.her} clients’ verdant tableaux.
Landscaper
For once, being young and inexperienced will work in {0.SimFirstName}’s favor! After all, {M0.he}{F0.she} is strong, energetic, and less likely to sue for hearing loss. In fact, the adults in the neighborhood will almost feel like they are doing {0.SimFirstName} a favor by letting {M0.him}{F0.her} push heavy equipment!
Lawn Mower
Sweet, sweet Simoleons! §§§! {0.SimFirstName} has earned enough trust to handle the Simoleons and the people who spend them. &quot;Service with a smile,&quot; {M0.his}{F0.her} manager always says, so {0.SimFirstName} takes orders, presses buttons, and grins until {M0.his}{F0.her} cheeks hurt. 
Food Service Cashier
Congratulations, {0.SimFirstName} has moved up in the world and is earning a smidge more every hour! A whole smidge! Now, instead of just being treated like {M0.he}{F0.she} is invisible, {M0.he}{F0.she} really is out of sight of the customers, focusing {M0.his}{F0.her} attention solely on hot grease and triple orders.

Simstagram Servers
Simstagram is too big and popular to fall to the hands of some deviants. Our security needs to be top notch.\n\nIf you are seeing this, it means you've been pre-approved to take this job. We screen everyone we might potentially work with. Can't be too careful.\n\nBe warned, you will be expected to keep tight-lipped on all Simstagram secrets. Failure to do so may result in an early termination... and we don't just mean from the job.

I'm also realizing now that I could be sending my files to the exact people I'm trying to hide them from. This is giving me a headache. Someone just take the job before I change my mind.

That sounds terrible! I'll talk to {2.SimFirstName} myself.
Are you kidding me? Does {2.SimFirstName} really think like that? I'm a bit caught off guard, but I'll talk with {F2.her}{M2.him} soon.
I understand your concern {0.SimFirstName}; I'll chat with {2.SimFirstName} soon. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous to approach {F2.her}{M2.him} after hearing that.
Wow, I’d love to get to know {M2.him}{F2.her}.
{2.SimFirstName} sounds like {F2.she}{M2.he} is an absolute pleasure to be around!
Wow {0.SimFirstName}! I wasn't aware that you felt so strongly about {2.SimFirstName}. {F2.She}{M2.He} seems like good company, I'll chat with {F2.her}{M2.him} soon.
{2.SimFirstName} sounds like a catch. I'll introduce myself when I see {2.SimPronounObjective}.

{M2.He}{F2.She} can’t be all that bad…
I completely understand if you and {2.SimFirstName} have issues, but I'd prefer if you left me out of your drama.
Those are some harsh words, {0.SimFirstName}. I don't believe that {2.SimFirstName} is that bad of a person.
Are we talking about the same person? {2.SimFirstName} and I have a great relationship, so please knock it off.
I can't stand to listen to this anymore. In case you weren't aware, {2.SimFirstName} and I are extremely close; stop bad mouthing {F2.her}{M2.him}!
Woah {0.SimFirstName}, you're talking about one of my best friends here; cut it out!
{M2.He}{F2.She} doesn’t sound that interesting.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I've already made up my mind about {2.SimFirstName}. Every time we're together we continue to despise each other a little more.
{2.SimFirstName} and I aren't on the best of terms right now, I don't think that's a good idea.
About that... {2.SimFirstName} and I constantly bicker, I'd rather not provoke that even further.
Sorry {0.SimFirstName}, but I'm way too busy at the moment to spend any time getting to know {2.SimFirstName} better.
After hearing what you had to say, I'm not feeling very inclined to chat with {2.SimFirstName}. I think I'll pass this time!
I don't know. {2.SimFirstName}? You're not very convincing.
What are you talking about? We’re in love!
We don't need your opinion about our relationship, thank you very much!
Who are you to tell me what to do? I love {2.SimFirstName} and you won't change that!
You’re right, I can do so much better than {M2.him}{F2.her}. I’m going to break up with {2.SimFirstName} tonight.
Really? I guess we are not that great of a couple. I should just end it already.
You are right, {2.SimFirstName} and I are not a good fit for each other after all. I will talk to {F2.her}{M2.him}.
(From Iceproof Trait)
While removing weeds, {0.SimFirstName} found a frog hiding in {M0.his}{F0.her} garden.

(From Fear of Swimming)
(From Fear of Magic)
{0.SimFirstName} always felt confident in {M0.his}{F0.her} belief in the supernatural. Something about that last ghost sighting unnerved {0.SimPronounObjective}. Seeing is believing, and now {0.SimFirstName} can't get the thought out of {M0.his}{F0.her} head that Ghosts could be everywhere. Always watching, always ready to jump out and scare {0.SimPronounObjective} at any moment.
(From Fear of Ghosts)
(From Fear of Fire)
Fires can be a vital source of heat or a calming warmth on a cold night. {0.SimFirstName} saw first hand the more destructive side of fire. {0.SimFirstName} never wants to see that again.
Everything does not seem to be going {0.SimFirstName}'s way at all lately. It has just been bad news after bad news. People keep saying &quot;You never know until you try!&quot; but never talk about how it feels after trying something new and it not working out. {0.SimFirstName} can't take another disappointment; it's terrifying and too painful to try again.
(From Performance Review)
Death is inevitable. {0.SimFirstName} knows that. {0.SimFirstName} just didn't think that {M0.he}{F0.she} would be thinking about it so soon. There is still so much to do! How will {0.SimFirstName} get everything done if death is just around the corner? Is it safer to just hide forever?!
(From Befriending Death)
How long has it been? {0.SimFirstName} can't help but wonder if this career is right for {M0.him}{F0.her}. One thing is for sure, there needs to be some kind of change, right?
(From Fear of Dead-End Job)
{0.SimFirstName} never knows what is lurking in the dark. Darkness is nothing but a veil to hide the most gruesome and terrifying creatures of the night. {M0.He}{F0.She} feels like they could pop out at any moment! And lately, this man named Vladislaus keeps calling!

(From Fear of Being Judged)
It might just be coincidence, but {0.SimFirstName} can't shake the feeling that others are just constantly judging {0.SimPronounObjective}. Is it {M0.his}{F0.her} hair? Personality? Friends? Whatever it is, {0.SimFirstName} is afraid that this won't be the end of it.
It feels like it has been forever since {0.SimFirstName} has been romantic with {M0.his}{F0.her} partner. It could be paranoia, it could be anxiety, or a gut feeling, but {0.SimFirstName} can't help but wonder what {M0.his}{F0.her} partner is up to or who they are seeing behind {M0.his}{F0.her} back!
(From Being Accused of Cheating)

Ever since {0.SimFirstName} realized {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} precious things could be sucked into the burglar's sack any evening, {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.has}{P0.have} been fretting about how {0.SimPronounSubjective} can better protect {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} stuff for next time.

Once upon a time, Moonwood Mill was filled with the bustle and sound of the nearby lumber mill. Today, the town is transformed. The rusted shells of its former industry provide cover for a handful of mysterious denizens who've sought out this wilderness-shrouded community, basking in its remote and anonymous nature. It's a place with a hidden history, and those who live here know that if you dig deep enough, you're bound to discover some fascinating secrets.

I feel like I'm drowning under the pressures of school and lunch is the only time I can come up for air.
Lunch is a great time to make some friends. Who wants to be besties?
The person who invented auto-correct died today. Restaurant in piece.
Hey, {0.SimFirstName}, I invented a new word. Plagiarism!
A skeleton walks into ThrifTea and orders a boba tea and a mop.
I ordered a chicken and egg online. I'll let you know which one comes first.
{0.SimFirstName}, we've been trying to reach you about your refrigerator's extended warranty.
If I go nap in the corner of the cafeteria I might just make it through the rest of the day...
How else would I get the energy to make it through the day?! Food is fuel, and fuel keeps me sane.
I've been looking forward to lunch! Getting to see all my friends and just hang out is the highlight of my school day.
I am truly content at lunch time. No one speak to me, I'm in my happy place.
Lunch is truly the best part of the day.
I hope the answer to number two was shaky handwriting and a single tear, cause that's what I put.
I didn't realize until the very end that I filled out the answer book backwards. Who does that?!
Every single tiny noise distracted me in there. A sneeze made me forget my answer. Total disaster.
Can't tell if I'm happy I did well or relieved that it's over...either way I'm feeling good!
Finals can't take me down! Crushed it!
Everyone's first impression of me is burping during orientation. If you need me I'll be hiding in my locker.
Did anyone do the summer reading? Or first day assignments? Did we even have any? I already feel so behind!
{0.SimFirstName} I'm so happy I have a friend like you.
{0.SimFirstName}, have you thought about taking up guitar? I think you'd crush it.
{0.SimFirstName}, what's up buddy?
{0.SimFirstName}, we should get together and hang out sometime!
Hey Bestie! Hope you're having an excellent day.
Your style is everything, teach me your ways!
A day full of weird small talk, introductions, and ice breakers. No thank you.
First day energy! Everyone's buzzing about!
First day means a fresh start! I'm excited to make some new friends and see what subjects I shine most in!
I have never been more proud of myself. I did it. I made it to graduation. 
Does graduation make anyone else sad? I'm not ready to let go. I'm not ready to grow up yet.
I'm so pumped to be out of school and on to the next chapter of my life!
Goodbye High school, hello adulthood!
There may have been other choices on the ticket, but I was the only correct choice for Prom Jester.
From Class Clown to Prom Royalty. Also the best position in the court, the Prom Jester!
Prom Jester! This is perfect. The hat compliments my outfit and doesn't even mess up my hair.
Zabba la pleeva, {0.SimFirstName}. Farbie za blarf!
{0.SimFirstName} is sneaky like a fox and that's why I don't trust {M0.him}{F0.her}.
If I had a Simoleon every time {0.SimFirstName} was cool, I'd be broke.
{0.SimFirstName} I'm about to BlicBLOCK you into next year. Begone peasant!
{0.SimFirstName}, consider this me throwing shade: Your mother is a llama and so are you!
{0.SimFirstName}, your face is so punchable. Just looking at it makes me want to throw down!
Being on stage... the lights... the stares. I'd rather the crown go to someone who wasn't going to puke.
I'm so proud to be chosen as this year's Prom {F0.Queen}{M0.King}. I will live up to this great honor.
Is there anything better than collapsing into your own bed after a nice long trip?
Traveling is fun but sometimes it's just good to be home. 
Being out and about can be so stressful! I need the calm peacefulness of home or I will lose it.
Everyone looks like royalty tonight, but I'll be the one with the crown! I'm thrilled to be this years Prom {M0.King}{F0.Queen}!
Hello beautiful home! I have returned!
And as the last page turned my soul sunk, for this was the end of a journey I'd never experience the same way again.
Who knew a book about llamas, beloved jewelry, and an affinity towards multiple brunches, would be so thrilling!
The only loss I feel is for myself. The last few hours will live on as a time spent tormented and bored to tears. 
Go see How to Lose a Llama in 10 Days. Was I just watching it? No. But it's highly underrated and people need to see it.
Tried something new and I'm regretting it now. Does this outfit look like I just faceplanted into a pile of clothes?
New outfit, new me! Check me out while I new boot scoot around! 
Feel free to stop and stare, I'm looking fresh to death!
While checking out they said &quot;Enjoy the clothes&quot;, to which I responded &quot;you too!&quot;. They didn't buy anything, I did.
Shopping is usually fun until the realization of how much you spent sets in.
Wow, thank you! I feel so loved! P.S. No one was pushed in front of a bus. Promise!
I about shopped 'til I dropped! Both my feet and my wallet are exhausted. But the haul was worth every Simoleon.
Since I hosted a party, does that mean people will expect me to host another? Do I have to do all of this AGAIN?!
When I say PARTY you say PARTY! PARTAYYY!!
I truly think I become the {F0.hostess}{M0.host} with the {F0.most-ess}{M0.most} tonight! My party will be the talk of the town.
I can't wait to make everyone pile in for a family photo! We have to remember these nights forever!
There's nothing worse than awkward silence and passive aggressive chewing during a family dinner.
Knowing that one day there will be less of us at this table is a thought I dread most.
Sharing a meal surrounded by loved ones fills me with such warmth. I adore these moments.
This tag is poking me...the music is loud...these shoes are pinching my feet. I regret coming to Prom, is that bad?!
I'm drowning in the soul crushing realization that my vacation is over and I have to return to real life! Why meee?!
Being away from home was so liberating! All my troubles just melted away.
Every time I take a vacation I feel like I'm forgetting something... Wait, did I leave the oven on?!
I've been bitten by the travel bug. Rain or shine, I'm itching to get out of here! Vacation awaits!
I can find inner peace just thinking about vacation. Can you imagine how zen I'll be once I'm actually on it?
It just dawned on me that with this ring comes wedding planning. There's so much to do! Where do I even start?
Being engaged has a nice ring to it, don't you think?
Can you say engaged? Cause I can!
I'm Engaged! Look at that sparkle! If you need me, I'll be spending the the day flashing my new bling around town.
Seeing us altogether at prom just makes me want to sob! I love everyone so much I don't want this night to end.
The wedding might be over, but now I need to get through the honeymoon!
Marriage, you know what that means. Guess who is never sleeping in a cold bed again.
I can't stop crying tears of joy! I've dreamt of this day for so long, and I'm so lucky to be with my one true love.
A misplaced laugh here, an awkward consolation there. How can anyone handle confronting mortality?
The haunting chill of death looms over us all! Who will be next?
To see such tragedy with my own eyes! A deep sorrow has now settled within me. I may never recover.
Today starts the next big chapter of my life with my forever person!
I've got a new bundle of joy lighting up my life. Diaper donations welcome.
Do you think my baby knows I have no idea what I'm doing?
Elated doesn't even begin to describe my emotions tonight. Prom is a dream come true!
I'm a proud {M0.Papa}{F0.Mama}! Is my baby the cutest baby in the world? You best believe it.
A successful day at work can really put you in a good mood. Today was not that kind of day. BRB, crying.
Wake up, grind, go home, rest. It's a steady routine and I am totally crushing it!
It feels good to spend the day productively. Work isn't always fun, but it is filled with tiny accomplishments.
All I do is wake up and go to work! When do I get to live life?!
That assignment is out of the way. Next class is going to be easy.
Homework's done. Now it's all me time.
This homework is worth .004% of my grade for the year. I can't relax not knowing what my grade will be.
These assignments are giving carpal tunnel. When will this torture end?!
One more day of my life wasted doing exercises from this blue book.  Will I ever finish?
It was a tough call but it was the right one for me. 
Crown or no crown, Prom is the best night ever!
Was dropping out the right thing to do? Will I regret this later?
Dropping out doesn't have to be a bad thing! I'm excited about the possibilities ahead of me.
Shoes, check! Fit, check! Hair, check! What else do I need for Prom?!
Did everyone know that loud typing was annoying? I'm over here clacking away completely oblivious!
I was totally in my element! I can feel my code getting better with each practice session.
Soon Prom will be over. I could swim in this spiral of misery forever. I'm not ready for this night to end.
I think I might regret going to Prom. It just isn't worth the pinchy shoes and crowded dancefloor.
I'm always distracted anytime I see {0.SimFirstName}. Learning can wait, I need to get my flirt on.
{0.SimName} Ribby wibs! Benzi chibna boof mik up frooby noop.
The heart wants what the heart wants, and this heart wants {0.SimFirstName}.
Call me Agnes Crumplebottom's purse, cause I'd hit on you, {0.SimFirstName}.
{0.SimFirstName}... Smash.
I get complete brainfreeze everytime I see {0.SimFirstName}. How can someone be so dreamy?!
Passing steamy looks across the room anytime I see {0.SimFirstName}. I need to get my flirt on.
We learned that the first ever programmer was the daughter of a Strangerville poet. Coolest story ever!
Someone punch my spine back into place. Being hunched over a computer for all of practice is giving me a hump.
I didn't realize how much strategy was involved and ended up looking more like a rookie than a rook in there.
I'd pawn my pawn for another practice session like that! I can really feel a sense of improvement.
Crushed the gambit! Three checkmates in a row makes me your {M0.King}{F0.Queen}.
Rusty? Check. Slow? Check. Feeling the haunting sense of imposter syndrome while being on this team? Checkmate.
I can't believe I killed the routine by dropping my pom poms mid kick... wait, pom poms? Is it pom poms or poms pom?
Not only did I boof the routine but I'm not even sure what the plural of a pom pom is! Is it poms pom? Or pom poms?
The team definitely puts the cheer in cheerleading. Smiling faces all around!
We hear it! We cheer it! We've got lots of pride and spirit! Ignite! Excite! Look at us, we're dynamite!
I'm a person and not a pretzel. I'm pretty sure my limbs aren't suppose to bend like that...
Half the fun of Prom is getting ready, right?
I should have read up on the rules. I thought getting a Safety was a good thing.
Earned &quot;{M0.King}{F0.Queen} of Fumbles&quot; today. Wish I could abdicate, hide my head in a pillow, and sleep until this is all over.

Graduation Tomorrow!
It's been quite a journey - {0.SimFirstName}'s graduation ceremony from {1.String} is tomorrow! Time to celebrate!
There's not much of this course left and I think you have a very good chance of failing it. I'm not sure what else to tell you at this point, other than to try to do more work earlier next time.
Your grades are on the cusp of failure, so I'd encourage you to take whatever time and work you have left in this course and focus your efforts if you want to pass this class.
I'm worried. You should have a better grasp of the material by now and your work has been lacking. If you want to pass this class, you need to set aside some time for studying these last few days of the term.
I'm worried that you haven't been putting the time or care into this class that it requires. You really need to buckle down if you want a good grade.
At this point, you need a strong final presentation to bring your grade back, so please spend some time working on it!
If you haven't already turned it in, you may be able to push your grade up a bit if you can put together a quality paper and turn it in on time.
If you haven't already turned it in, you may be able to push your grade up a bit if you can put together a quality presentation and present it in time.
At this point, you need a really strong final paper to bring your grade back, so please spend some time writing it!
You have a passing grade, so if that's all you need, you're good to go. If you have any remaining work or time to commit to the class, though, there is indeed room for improvement.
You're tracking a bit below average right now, and there isn't all that much time left. Finish strong and you should have nothing to worry about.
I'd say that you've fallen a bit behind the class average, but it's nothing a bit of studying, attendance, and attention to homework can't solve.
I honestly would have hoped for a bit more progress from you at this point, but you still have plenty of time to turn it around. Come to lectures with completed homework, and maybe spend a bit more time studying.
Something that'll ensure a strong finish is submitting a good final presentation, so make sure you plan for that!
Another important part of this course will be submitting a strong final presentation, so spending time on that can also be a big help.

Something that'll ensure a strong finish is submitting a good final paper, so make sure you plan for that!
You put in a solid term and have earned a solid grade. Any additional academic work you've still got to do will help, but your grade is certainly satisfactory.
You’re doing fine! Stay on top of your homework, and I'll see you in class.
Of course, if you are still working on your paper or have just forgotten to turn it in, please do so before the term ends or you'll get no credit for it!
Go ahead and put the finishing touches on, and then submit your final presentation before the end of term if you haven't already.

If you haven't been working on your paper, I'd encourage you to do so to ensure you finish out the term well.
You're a stellar student and have one of the highest grades in my class! I wish more of my students were as committed as you were to mastering the material.
You are doing quite well! Finish up whatever work you may have left this term and I'm sure your grade will reflect the hard work you've put in.
You are doing exceptionally well, considering that we've still got a few days left in the term. Keep it up and you'll get top marks.
It's still early, but you've already shown that you can get ahead. Keep it up with the homework, attendance, and studying!
Well, unfortunately, it’s too early to say. Stay on top of your homework, and I'll see you in class.
You've also got a few more days to work on your paper, which - if it's as good as the work you've done so far - will surely secure you an excellent grade.
You've also got a few more days to work on your presentation, which - if it's as good as the work you've done so far - will surely secure you an excellent grade.
Oh, and don't forget that the presentation due before the end of the term will count quite a bit toward your grade!
Oh, and don't forget that the paper due before the end of the term will count quite a bit toward your grade!
Dropped Out!
{0.SimFirstName} has now dropped out of {1.String}. {M0.He}{F0.She} cannot enroll in university courses for the next {2.Number} days.
Really drop out?
Should {0.SimFirstName} drop out of university?\n\nThis will clear {M0.his}{F0.her} degree progress and {M0.he}{F0.she} will not be able to enroll for any classes for {1.Number} days.
Enough time has passed since {0.SimFirstName} dropped out from university. {M0.He}{F0.She} can enroll in university classes again.

The temperament of a papillon is a happy, friendly, adventurous dog. They are not shy or aggressive. Papillon's make excellent family dogs but should be watched around little children, as should any dog, due to a small child's lack of understanding of a dog's behavior and the likelihood that they will do something to upset the dog.

Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Although individual differences in personality exist, common traits exist throughout the Staffords. Due to its breeding, and history, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is known for its character of fearlessness and loyalty. This, coupled with its affection for its friends, its off-duty quietness and trustworthy stability, make it a foremost all-purpose dog.
Tonkinese

A collection of Butterflies and Moths found at various locations around Gibbi Point.
Gibbi Point Butterflies &amp; Moths
&lt;i&gt;In Wanderwood Wilds, by the water's embrace, owl eyes hide in a leafy place.\n\nA tower stands guard near where this mystery lies. Find it before the daylight dies.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;At a festival where young and old convene, miss butterfly Jorja joins the scene.\n\nIn purple grace, where meals abound, a butterfly who goes where friends are found.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Crystal Valley, by the Electric Lagoon, catch a Jellyfish to summon a butterfly or two.\n\nPlace in World to make them appear, and then watch as Jelly Butterflies flutter near.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Crystal Valley and Jellyfish Junction, at sun's fall, a Goliath of moths heeds night’s call.\n\nNightly when most Sims dream, seek this moth where the city lights gleam.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Wanderwood Wilds' path near the waterfall’s gleam, a butterfly's wings shimmer, nearly unseen.\n\nSeek in the day's gentle light, amidst the foliage, a translucent sight.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Crystal Valley, where treasures unfold, miss Dina floats like sun and gold.\n\nSpotted in the midday gleam, find this beauty by the miner's stream.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On Jellyfish Junction shores, when the moon is new, a moth gathers for a bioluminescent view.\n\nWith death’s embrace and the Reaper’s grace, find this moth in its haunting space.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In the dark of night on Crystal Valley's land, a Cryptid Moth lurks. The mystery expands.\n\nIn the foliage near the Plumbird’s lair, solve the quest to find it there.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Crafted in magic, to life it springs, a butterfly of paper spreads its wings.\n\nCollect all others to see it thrive, placed in a habitat to come alive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;At the fire festival’s heart, a mysterious sphinx plays its part.\n\nNear the flame, in wilderness' domain, discover this moth where stories reign.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Wanderwood Wilds where the Rangers reside, a Birdwing's fluttering is hard to hide.\n\nSearch in bushes, and flowers too, near the station, a black, yellow, teal hue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Begin with Toshie in Jellyfish Junction’s heart. The Melody of the Geyser is where you start.\n\nInvestigate and return, then Boulder Strike. Watch the Red Admiral take its flight.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Along Jellyfish Junction's shores in glimmering light, a pirate's lover takes her flight.\n\nSpotted daily, in lilac attire, she is a princess whose legend never tires.&lt;/i&gt;
Despite this familiar being the mysterious and silent type you may still catch yourself whispering to them, “Do that voodoo that you do!”
This interesting creature is an unexpected entity that defies normal boundaries and demands a closer inspection. Its true nature is unknown.
The Veild is a Voidcritter deep with the knowledge of countless galaxies across space and time. No one really knows the true motivation of this critter, but that didn’t stop one well known kids TV show from almost featuring the Veild as a main character.
A classic Spellcaster companion, bats have commonly been closely associated to magic users since the times of ancients.
The harbingers of prophecy and, some say, bad luck. Ravens are an ancient creature that remain steadfast alongside their favorite Spellcasters.
The Phoenix is intimately familiar with the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. From the ashes they arise and into the ashes they fall. So has it always been.

Snowy the Sandman
There must have been some magic in…\n&#xA;Those old starfish they found.\n&#xA;For when they placed them on his chest…\n&#xA;…the sand just crumbled away. It was horrible. I’ll never forget the expression on poor Snowy’s face as he was washed away in the surf.
Decorative Presents - Large
If a catalog could sigh, this one would. A large version of this Decorative farce? Because the smaller stack wasn't enough of a slap in the face to your loved ones?  Sure, it’s decorative, but it’s deceptively festive, and that’s the wrong flavor of festive. Focus next time on gingerbread or candy canes, you know? Happy Holidays?
Papercraft Ceiling Decorations
The lost art of papercraft is finding new vigor! Youth across the nation are taking time away from their digital selves, and are discovering how the kids from the past spent their days pre-internet... cutting, crafting, glueing, and stringing up their art, all in the name of papercraft.
Flip-Flop Wall Lights
Are they on? Are they off?&#xA;With so much flip flopping it’s impossible to tell!
Glass, Wax, and Wood
The trinity wholeness of the triangular expression of the bottle placements in conjunction with their wax-like appendages reaching forth into the vastness of space, complimented by the nearly ninety degree angles of the lifeless branch laying beneath the uplifting bottles is metaphoric expression of the highest caliber.
Log Display LV-426
I'll tell you what I know...\n\nWhen you set down an LV-426, you'll feel an unexplained attachment to all the details. Whenever you rest your gaze upon LV-426, it'll feel like a hug for your face... a little face hugger.\n\nYou can try and shake that feeling, but it's like something stirs inside you, wanting to burst forth.\n\nLV-426 isn't for everyone, but once you feel that attachment, you are attached for life.
Surfin' Santa
If everybody had an ocean…&#xA;at Christmas time.&#xA;Then everybody’d be surfin’…&#xA;like this Santa guy.
Pre-strung Tree of Lights
You've done it. You probably used to love it, but then you had to do it again and again. And now it just hurts to even think about doing it. So let us do it for you! The Pre-strung Tree of Lights is perfect for those who are just tired of doing it.
Holiday Tree
Break out the Holiday Tree for holiday time... or any time, really! Especially if your household decor has that whole snowflake-and-ornament thing going on.

Luck o' the Meduso
Nothing says St. Patrick's Day like encouraging a Meduso to chug a glass of green food coloring.
Meduso Lovin'&#xA;
This Meduso's favorite holiday is Valentine's Day... well, until Sims got the bright idea to start shooting it with cupid arrows.\n\nPLEASE don't shoot your Meduso with cupid arrows.
Sexaduso Sweater
The only thing that could top this Meduso's ugly Christmas sweater would be a sweater with Meduso's printed on it...\n\n...hey, that's not a half bad idea!
Meduso Gobbler&#xA;
It's a little known fact that Medusos taste like turkey. Make this Meduso Gobbler your table's centerpiece and celebrate Thanksgiving in style!&#xA;
Jack-O'-Meduso
Happy Halloween! This Meduso will hang out on your porch to greet any eager trick-or-treaters. Just don't try and stuff a candle inside it...
Meduso
The gelatinous texture of Meduso's body can be deceptive. Its amorphous shape is as weightless as the feathers that adorn its head, giving it the ability to drift through the air and avoid danger. While often mistaken as a mouth, the cavity in its face is in fact an enlarged nostril, giving it a predilection to track down the source of intensely fragrant smells.\n\nEpisode 20 of the hit TV show Voidcritters saw a flock of Meduso latch themselves onto a perfume saleswoman, causing chaos at the local mall. Our hero, Leif, cleverly helped lure the Meduso away with the scent of succulent meat when he fired up the grill in a nearby park.&#xA;

Startling Sound
Even when expected, the sudden POP of a Holiday Cracker can still be nerve-wracking.
It’s depressing to get scrap, when festive goodies are anticipated.&#xA;
Crinkle. Whiz. Pop!
The delight of holiday crackers is that they're both naughty and nice.
True holiday joy is loud noises and a mess of confetti.
Bah, Humbug!
The terrible tinkle of joyful children is the worst part of the holiday season. That, and caroling. Ugh!

Super smart and determined, Camille is passionate about food and nutrition, and how it fuels people in living their best lives. Camille grew up in France, and often visits her relatives in Morocco. Her multicultural background, and passion for building connection through food, has helped inspire the unique flavors of her cuisine. Camille runs a cafe, and is always thinking about testing new recipes on her customers-turned-friends.
Fashion-forward. A bit cocky. A family man. Oh, and evil. Brent dreams of world-domination—preferably from his own private Island where he eats kalua barbecue and lives with his mum and the future Mrs. Hong. Though his love for Kierra Tilo is no secret, he's noticed she only has eyes for another. Will this development put a halt to his plans for world-domination or will the young villain find a way to preserver and build his evil empire?
Babs' time as a Mixologist was the perfect opportunity to meet—and date—a lot of interesting people that came into and out of her life. Ultimately, she fell completely in love with Ollie. After a picturesque wedding (and three beautiful children), she found herself wanting a new line of work away from the bar scene. Turns out, she's had a talent for writing pent up inside her this entire time. 
Some Sims have taken to avoiding Armand, as his snobbish attitude can rub others the wrong way. In reality, it's a public persona he's developed to hide his sensitive side. In the privacy of his home, he enjoys a good cry in the bathtub to put his emotions at ease. Whenever he's feeling down, he calls his bestie Amber Stein—it's impossible to feel gloomy around her!
Andre is a tough nut to crack. Anyone who works with him recognizes his genius, but his mood swings drive people away. He can go from silly, to embarrassed, to angry in a flash. When he's not staring at his computer screen, he tends to be hatching a mischievous scheme... but it's difficult for him to recognize when his pranks cross the line. Ultimately, it's cute, cuddly, innocent animals that he bonds best with.
Amber's a lovable goof who puts a smile on the face of anyone she encounters. As a self-professed comedian, she even manages to practice her set on occasion at local lounges. In fact, that's where she met Armand. There he was in the audience, in one of his moods, trying to get cheered up... There she was, telling bad jokes on the stage, and dancing awkwardly. They immediately hit it off, and have been best friends ever since!
Fashionista, social-climber, party-girl, secret genius. All of that outward materialism–it's mostly a persona. Aliya is exclusive when it comes to her private life and goals. Since she was a little girl, she's dreamed of becoming a Super Villain, hidden in plain view within the dazzling spotlight of Del Sol Valley. She has the brains to pull it off, but can she keep it a secret in such a high-stakes environment?

This unit's quality rating is determined by four categories, which together create an overall Unit Rating. Each category consists of three tiers of quality. Units with higher ratings attract more Tenant applicants, allowing Property Owners to command a higher Rent Per Day for the unit.

This section displays Sims without a designated residential interested in this unit, including played and not played households. The Rent Cap for each household represents the maximum amount of Rent Per Day they can afford. Look for the green checkmark, as it indicates a compatible match ready to move in. It's also a good idea to choose a household with a Beds Wanted count that matches the number of beds available in this Unit.

If checked, Fairy Sims outside of the Active Household will not appear autonomously in Fairy Form in Worlds other than Innisgreen. Certain player-directed actions will still cause Fairy Sims to reveal their Fairy Form.\n\nThis change will not be applied to Fairy Sims that are currently spawned until after the next load.
Enabling this option means you will not see Fairy Sims in their Fairy Form outside of Innisgreen, except through player action.
Limit Fairies to Innisgreen
If disabled, Sims will not experience any effects related to Balance or Imbalance. This may mean a Sim experiences fewer Ailments but will not eliminate them overall. Balance &amp; Imbalance UI will not appear in the Simology Panel.
Enabling this option means that Moods will influence Sims' state of Balance over time, leading to effects that impact Needs and Ailments.
Enable Balance &amp; Imbalance:
If disabled, Ailments will no longer spread contagiously. Once disabled, Sims who already have Ailments will need to wait it out or seek a cure, but no more Sims will contract Ailments through spontaneous spread. Being near or interacting with Sims who have an Ailment will no longer have any risk of contagious spread.\n\nWhether or not this is disabled, Fairy Sims in your Household can still give Ailments to other Sims if they have unlocked the Cure or Apply Ailments Fairy Ability. Naturopath Sims who choose to Work From Home will still be able to receive clients with Ailments who need treatment.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Sims who become Very Imbalanced will still contract an Ailment. Uncheck both &lt;i&gt;Enable Balance &amp; Imbalance&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Enable Ailment Spread&lt;/i&gt; to disable all natural sources of Ailments.
Enabling this means Sims can develop Ailments from everyday exposure, especially being around other Sims who already have an Ailment.

Travel
There is a big world waiting for your Sim outside of their home Lot! \n\nIn addition to a change in scenery, traveling has many perks. As your Sims visit new places, they’ll encounter new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Collectibles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;experiences&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Why not order a drink at the Bar or get some help with their exercise from the trainer at the Gym?\n\nBefore your Sims can afford more expensive Objects, they can visit a Venue and use them for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;free&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For example, computers can be found at the Library.
Moving
Moving will open the World Map. Lots that you can move to without any modifications are &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;outlined in green&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Lots &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;outlined in yellow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are either too expensive to buy fully furnished, or another Household already lives there.\n\nPick a Lot and press the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Confirm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button in the lower right corner to start moving!\n\nRemember that you can use the World Select button to move to another World.
Once you’ve picked a Lot, you will get options to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;keep&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sell&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your current furniture (keeping the furniture puts them in the Household Inventory) and whether to buy the new Lot &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;furnished&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unfurnished&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bulldozed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can see your remaining funds under the Household portrait.\n\nIf you’re moving to a Lot where someone already lives, you will get a choice whether to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move in&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with them or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;evict&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them first.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Finalize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the move with the Purchase Home or Move In button!
So it’s time for your Sims to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move someplace new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Perhaps they have outgrown their current home, want independence from their parents, or they’ve earned enough Simoleons to buy a fancier house. Or maybe you just want a change of scenery!
You’ll find the options for moving in the Cell Phone’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Travel app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nUse the Move Household option to move the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;entire Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to a new Lot, or Split from Household and Move option to move &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;parts of the Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to a new Lot.\n\nThe Split option opens a new menu. Here you can decide &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;which Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will move out and how much &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; they will bring with them. You can press the Select another Household button to move them into another Household.
There is a big world waiting for your Sim outside of their home Lot! You can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;explore&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the Neighborhood your Sim lives in—who knows what adventure awaits just down the road—or use your Cell Phone to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;travel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; somewhere else.\n\nIf you want a more permanent change of scenery, or simply need more room for a growing family, you can also use the Cell Phone to move to a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;new home&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Game Speed
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Time&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; goes by, hour by hour, day by day. But in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have the power to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;control&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it!\n\nLearn all about controlling the Game Speed and how to keep track of the passing of time in the Lessons below.
Mentoring
Mentoring can be offered or asked for in two different ways. When a Sim is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;already practicing a Skill&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the Mentor can select the Offer Mentoring interaction on them, or the Mentee can select Ask for Mentoring on the Mentor.\n\nYou can also select an Offer Mentoring or Ask for Mentoring interaction on a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill-building object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If accepted, this will make the Mentee start practising the Skill before Mentoring starts. Handy, huh?\n\nMentoring is free by default, but Mentors can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Offer Paid Mentoring&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on Skill-building objects to Sims from other households. Ka-ching!
When a Sim receives Mentoring, this speeds up the rate of their Skill gain. The biggest impact on the speed is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Mentor's Skill level&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;—a Sim at Skill level 10 will be better at Mentoring than a Sim at Skill level 5!\n\nThere are other ways to boost Mentoring. For example, a Mentor can buy the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Super Mentor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Reward Trait from the Rewards Store.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Mentoring&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; allows skilled Sims to pass on their knowledge to other Sims. Once they reach &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;level 5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in a Mentorable Skill, they can Mentor other Sims in that Skill (as long as the Mentor's Skill is a higher level than the Mentee's), which speeds up Skill gain.\n\nTo find out if a Skill is Mentorable, you can check its description in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Here you can also learn on which objects Mentoring is available.
Child Skills
Children have 4 skills of their very own, called Fundamental Skills. Each Skill can be built upon by interacting with other Sims or objects. Advancing in each of the Fundamental Skills unlocks new ways for Children to interact with the world around them. \n\nChildren may also start developing certain &quot;adult&quot; Skills that are available for Teens and older. However, because they are children, they gain these skills at a slower rate. Like Fundamental Skills, these basic Skills may unlock new ways for Children to interact with the world, but some interactions will require them to age up to Teen before they become available. 
Sims need &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to pay the bills! Skills are essential for advancing in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Careers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and can also help your Sims earn some extra &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the side.\n\nSkills have other benefits as well; as your Sims improve their Skills, they will unlock new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;interactions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, craft &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unique objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, get better at building &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and so much more.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Buy a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill Book&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the bookshelf, or a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill building Object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the Build Mode catalog, and get started!
There is also information on Skills located in the Skills panel at the bottom right. This can be accessed by clicking on the Lightbulb Icon or pressing the [L] shortcut. Progress across all Skills is easily visible in this panel, and the right column indicates current Skill Level. Hovering over a Skill Icon or Name also gives additional information about that skill and what objects allow your Sim to gain it.\n\nWhen a Skill (or multiple Skills) are actively being gained the affected Skill(s) will glow to indicate active progress.
Most Skills have a total of 10 Levels, though some will occasionally have 5. Progress for Skills can be tracked in two places. \n\nThe first place is in the game window. While actively gaining a skill, a Progress Bar will display above a Sim's head with the Skill icon. This bar indicates how close a Sim is to gaining a new level, and once the bar has completely filled a new Level in that Skill will be gained.
Romantic Boundaries
If a Sim is exploring &lt;b&gt;Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt;, they may Reconsider if asked by another Sim. Select another Sim, choose the &lt;b&gt;“Relationship”&lt;/b&gt; category, then choose the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Change Relationship&quot;&lt;/b&gt; subcategory. Find the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Ask To Reconsider Romantic Boundaries&quot;&lt;/b&gt; category. In this category there are social interactions that Sims can use to ask another Sim to Reconsider specific Romantic Boundaries.\n\nIf a Sim is &lt;b&gt;not Exploring Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt; they cannot be asked to Reconsider.\n\nLearn more about setting up your Sims' Romantic Boundaries in Lessons under &lt;b&gt;Create A Sim &gt; Identity &amp; Personality &gt; Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt;
Sims must learn each other's Romantic Boundaries by asking! Select another Sim, choose the &lt;b&gt;“Relationship”&lt;/b&gt; category then the &lt;b&gt;“Learn More”&lt;/b&gt; category, and finally choose the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Ask about Romantic Boundaries&quot;&lt;/b&gt; interaction.&#xD;&#xA;Once a Sim agrees to share this, their reply will appear as a text notification. Their Romantic Boundaries will also be recorded in their Sim Profile page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;
Even though some Sims are Loner, they are all social creatures. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Socializing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with other Sims is essential for their happiness.\n\nAs your Sim builds stronger (or at least more &lt;i&gt;intense&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with those around them, new social interactions and possibilities are unlocked. \n\nMeet new Sims and become BFFs, partners in crime, enemies with benefits, soulmates, and more! 
Pie Menu Subcategories
Within each of the main categories of the pie menu, such as &lt;b&gt;Friendly&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Mean&lt;/b&gt;, there are now a collection of subcategories present to sort interactions. Each subcategory will further classify the interactions your Sims can perform on each other, making it easier for you to find that specific &lt;b&gt;Joke&lt;/b&gt; you wanted to tell, or &lt;b&gt;Argument&lt;/b&gt; you wanted to start.\n\nUniquely important interactions, such as Proposals or Divorces, can still be found outside of subcategories.
Personality
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which is mainly based on their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, influences the way they experience and interact with the world around them in a number of ways. Learn more below!
Managing Needs
Another tip for efficient Needs management is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;multitasking&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Sims can do some things at the same time, such as eating in front of the TV to fulfill their Hunger and Fun needs at the same time.\n\nYou should also consider your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; when managing their Needs. A Bookworm will have more Fun reading, while a Music Lover prefers to listen to music.
Managing your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is essential to ensure their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;happiness&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;productivity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and even &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;survival&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nYou can see the current state of your Sim’s Needs in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If you click on a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Need icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, your active Sim will try to do something to take care of that Need.
More &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;expensive Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;effective&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at fulfilling Sims’ Needs. \n\nYou can check which Need an Object can fulfill, and how efficient it is, in the Object’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;tooltip&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build catalog&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Needs
If you want to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;care&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;well being&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (or… experiment with it), look no further! \n\nManaging your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;physical&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;mental Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; allows them to live happy, fruitful lives; however, if they get low, they will experience negative Emotions and might even die!
They say &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can’t buy happiness, but it sure helps to keep your Sims content! Learn all about how to earn big Simoleons so your Sims can put food on the table, pay their bills, and build their dream home!
Life Stages
While Sims are still growing up, they experience many “firsts”. \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Infants&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are entirely reliant on their caregivers to ensure their basic needs are met. Giving them lots of attention will help them in these early formative days.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Toddlers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are still largely dependent on their caregivers, and will need help learning things like how to walk and talk.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sims take on some more advanced Skills, have their first Aspiration, and start School. \n\nSchool continues as Sims become &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Teens&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Now they can get a Part-Time Job and begin to explore their romantic interests, too!
As your Sim reaches &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;adulthood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, they are able to join full-time Careers, get married, have or adopt children, and more. \n\nOnce your Sim become an &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Elder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, they’re able to Retire and cash in on their lifetime of hard work with a daily pension check! Elderhood is also a great time to indulge in hobbies and spend time with loved ones.
There are eight Life Stages your Sims can experience: &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Newborn&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Infant&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Toddler&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Teen&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Young Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Elder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nAs your Sims age and grow, there are new life events, relationships, and more to try!
Follow your Sims from the cradle to the grave. As time goes on, Sims will age and go through seven &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Life Stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; Baby, Toddler, Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, and Elder; each with their unique experiences and challenges.\n\nAfter a long and eventful life (or a shorter one, if your Sim has an &lt;i&gt;accident&lt;/i&gt;), all Sims must face the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Grim Reaper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;—unless they’ve found a way to cheat death…\n\nDeath doesn’t have to be the end. Keep the remains of your late relatives around, and you might have a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;nightly visitor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
Falling in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;love&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;children&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and spending time with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relatives&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be a very meaningful part of your Sim’s life! \n\nFollow the newest additions to the family as they &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;grow up&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from adorable babies to inquisitive toddlers, have their first day of School as a Child, and begin to explore their identity, responsibilities, and relationships as Teens. \n\nAnd who knows, perhaps they will continue the family &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;legacy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with a child of their own one day! 
Your Sims are feeling creatures! Their current mood, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, has a big impact on what they do and how they do it. Learn about the effects of Emotions, good and bad, and how to manage them in the Lessons below.
Camera Controls
The tiny people living in your computer have big dreams (and worries)! Learn all about &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wants&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fears&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and how your Sim can master them to earn powerful &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Play with Life&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (and Death) in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Follow your Sims from the cradle to the grave as they experience the joys and challenges of each stage of life.
Infant Care
Much like Newborns, Infants require bottle or breastfeeding for nourishment. All caregivers can bottle feed. To allow parents to breastfeed, enter &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create A Sim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. Under &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, select whether your Sim can produce milk.
Sims will autonomously want to check on and care for Infants, especially when an Infant is fussing or crying. Frequency and quality of care is impacted by a Caregiver's Traits, Ages, and Relationship with the Infant.\n\nSims who do not share a relationship with the infant won't care about them as much. Not all Sims start out as Caregivers. If a Sim in the household would like to become a Caregiver for the Infant they can click on the Infant and choose to Adopt as Care Dependent.
Time for bed! Although Infants can sleep on the floor or be given a nap, your Infant will rest better if you click on the Crib and select &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put Infant to Sleep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.\n\nSims can add a Baby Mobile to play lullabies for Infants. You can also read Infants a bedtime story and soothe them to sleep.
Infants rely on their caregivers to get their needs met, and for help with navigating the world around them. They need to be fed, changed, and paid attention to! A well-cared-for Infant is a happy Infant that is sure to grow into a successful Toddler.
Infants can also be fed in the High Chair! At this stage in their life, &quot;adult food&quot; is more about exploration and bonding. It probably won't fill them up fully, but they will enjoy the variety real food provides. \n\nInteract with the Infant or High Chair to choose this method of feeding. Each Infant will have a preference for each type of food. They can either Like, Love, Dislike, or be Unsure about a particular food.
Sims can clean up their messy infants by giving them a bath! Bathing is not just a routine, it's also an occasion to bond with family members. But beware—some splashing may occur! \n\nInteract with the bathtub or select the infant and choose to give a bath or a bubble bath.
To stay entertained, Infants can play with toybox toys, dollhouses, nesting blocks, and stuffed animals. Sims can also read Toddler Books to Infants.
Keep Infants and Toddlers in an area with baby proofing! Click on a door or gate and select &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apply Baby Proofing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; under the &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lock For...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; category.

Create A Sim
Getting Started
Relatives &amp; Relationships
You can set the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relationship&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; between your Sims in the Household Relationships menu. \n\nSome relationships are restricted by age; for example, a Sim has to be a Young Adult or older to have children, and their children must be younger than them.
You can find the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Play with Genetics&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button in the Add a Sim menu. Selecting this button opens the Genetics panel.
When creating a Sim by Playing with Genetics, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are automatically applied.
When creating a new Household, you can decide if the Sims are roomies, relatives, or partners. \n\nBy using the Genetics tool, you can make new Sims that look like your existing Sims by using their “genes”. This is an easy way to add children, parents, and siblings!
In the Genetics panel, choose a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationship&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Child, Sibling, or Parent), pick &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;who&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; they are related to, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and roll your new Sim by clicking the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Randomize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.\n\n\nIf you like the result, select the Done button to add the new Sim to your Household.
Makeup
Most makeup swatches include &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sliders&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to customize your Sim's look further. Adjust the Hue, Opacity, Saturation, and Brightness to customize the makeup for that perfect look.\n\nYou can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a customized swatch to use it again later.
To customize your Sim’s makeup, select their face and then the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Makeup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button. This will show you all makeup options, or you can view each subcategory at a time.
Most makeup have multiple color options, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;swatches&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can find an item’s swatches below it in the menu.\n\nIf you want to find every makeup option that has a swatch of a specific color, you can use the color filter. Learn more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filters Lesson&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Elevate your Sim's look with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;makeup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Add some flair to your Sim's face with eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, lipstick, and face paint to bring out their unique sense of self.
Clothes
Each category has a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;preset filter&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that determines which clothing options are available. The preset is only a suggestion; feel free to remove or change these filters as you wish!\n\nAlmost all Create a Sim items are available for all genders and Outfit categories if you remove the preset filters.
Most clothing pieces have multiple color options, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;swatches&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Some swatches even have unique patterns and prints! You can find an item’s swatches below it in the menu.\n\nIf you want to find every piece of Clothing that has a swatch of a specific color, you can use the color filter. Learn more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filters Lesson&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Accessories, Shoes &amp; Hats
In some categories, you can select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;multiple&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; items. Why not flaunt your bling by wearing a ring on each finger and bracelets on both wrists?
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Shoes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;socks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;leggings&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rings&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bracelets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;nailpolish&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be accessed by selecting your Sim’s body.\n\nSelect &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Shoes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to show all shoes, or use the subcategories to browse a more specific selection. \n\nIf you select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it will show all socks, leggings, rings, bracelets, and nailpolish, or you can select a subcategory’s button to browse just those items.
Nothing adds character and flair to an outfit like &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Dress your Sim up in hats, shoes, bracelets, glasses, earrings and more to express their unique sense of style.
To try out some &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hats&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;piercings&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;glasses&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;necklaces&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select your Sim’s head. \n\nSelect &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hats&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to show all hats, or use the subcategories to browse a more specific selection.\n\nSimilarly, you can select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to view all piercings, glasses, and necklaces, or you can view each subcategory at a time.
Outfits
You can have up to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;5 Outfits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in each category. Select the arrow above the outfit category button and then the plus button to add more Outfits to that category.\n\nYou can delete an outfit by pressing the x, but you must have at least one outfit per category.
Voice &amp; Walkstyle
Does your Sim speak in a high pitch or a low rumble? Do they saunter, strut, or bounce down the street? You can customize your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Walkstyle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the Identity panel.
Traits &amp; Aspirations
A Sim’s Aspiration is what they aspire to be, do, and experience! Sims will be given &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; based on their Aspiration that can be completed for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nSelect the Pick an Aspiration button to pick your first &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Most Aspiration &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have multiple options. For instance, click on Food and choose between Master Chef and Master Mixologist!\n\nYour first Aspiration will also give your Sim a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bonus Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that you can see next to your selected Aspiration!
What’s going on inside your Sim’s head? Their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; define their personality, and their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gives them goals and dreams!
To customize your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select a Pick a Trait button and pick Traits until all Trait slots are filled. These Traits affect everything in the game from Emotions and Skills to Hobbies and Relationships.\n\nSome Traits can't be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;paired&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with other Traits. For example, you can't be both Good and Evil. \n\nSome traits may be more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;challenging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to play with, but they will provide unique opportunities for your Sims!
Romantic Boundaries
&lt;b&gt;Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt; control what does or doesn't make Sims experience romantic Jealousy. By default, all Sims experience Jealousy if a partner engages in any kind of romance with other Sims. You can change this!\n\nRomantic Boundaries can be configured in the &lt;b&gt;Identity Panel&lt;/b&gt; in Create A Sim. The first three settings control if your Sim experiences Jealousy when a partner engages in certain types of romantic interactions with other Sims. The settings are:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-physical romance&lt;/b&gt;, which is any romance where the Sims' bodies do not touch. These can be found in the &lt;b&gt;Affection and Flirtation&lt;/b&gt; categories of the &lt;b&gt;Romance&lt;/b&gt; interaction menu when you select another Sim.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical romance&lt;/b&gt;, under the &lt;b&gt;Physical Intimacy&lt;/b&gt; category of the Romance interaction menu. This setting controls Jealousy caused by a partner having romantic physical contact, but &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; include Mess Around (Teen Sims) or WooHoo (Adult Sims.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The third setting specifically covers &lt;b&gt;Mess Around&lt;/b&gt; (for Teen Sims) or &lt;b&gt;WooHoo&lt;/b&gt; (for Adult Sims.) These interactions are also found in the Physical Intimacy category.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The last setting says if a Sim is &lt;b&gt;Exploring Romantic Boundaries.&lt;/b&gt; If the Sim is exploring, they may reconsider each of the three boundaries listed above, by talking about it with other Sims in Live Mode. If the Sim is not exploring, their boundaries are firm and they cannot be asked to reconsider.\n\nUse these settings to decide how Jealousy does (or doesn't) unfold in Live Mode. Learn more Romantic Boundaries in Lessons under &lt;b&gt;Live Mode &gt; Relationships &amp; Socializing &gt; Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt;
Pronouns
Name &amp; Age
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Name&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim! Who are they? Click on the text to expand the Name panel, and type in First and Last names for the Sim. No idea what to name your Sim? Click Randomize Name and let us pick one for you!
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or Life Stage, is set in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Identity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; menu. Select their Life Stage, from Infant to Elder.\n\n\nKeep in mind that changing a Sim’s Life Stage might remove their Traits, Aspiration, and Relationships if they’re no longer valid.
Gender &amp; Sexual Orientation
There are powerful ways to customize a Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sexual Orientation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sexual Orientation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is also set in the Customize menu under the Gender buttons. It's available for Sims who are Teens or older.\n\nYou can set which gender(s) a Sim is attracted to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;romantically&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (who they can build a romantic relationship with) and which gender(s) they’re interested in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Messing Around&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Woohoo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with. \n\nFor example, to make a biromantic and asexual Sim, set them to be romantically attracted to men and women, and to be interested in Woohoo with no gender.\n\nYou can also decide if a Sim is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;exploring romantically&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; if not, they will turn down advances from Sims who aren’t of the gender(s) they’re attracted to.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be set in the Identity panel. If the Sim is a Teen or older, you can further customize their Gender by selecting the Customize button below the Gender buttons and opening the Gender tab.\n\nIn this menu, you can select your Sim’s Physical Frame (their basic body shape); their Clothing Preference (this determines the preset filter when editing Outfits, but you can always remove these filters); whether your Sim can become pregnant, get others pregnant, or neither; and if your Sim can use the toilet standing up or not.
You can change your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Pronouns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the dropdown menu next to their name. Expande the Name panel to access it. If no Pronouns are selected, Pronouns in texts will be based on your Sim's Gender.\n\nPick between the preset Pronouns, or create &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Custom Pronouns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The latter option will open the Custom Pronouns window. Use the example sentences below each version of your Custom Pronouns to make sure it will work correctly in text.
Create a Ghost
Ghost Sims can be customized to wear any regular outfits available for living Sims, in addition to those exclusive to Ghosts! From casual wear to formal, the choice is yours to give your Ghost Sim a unique and personalized look that reflects their otherworldly style.
In Create a Sim, you now have the option to create a Ghost! Next to the Aspiration trait icon, you'll find a new molecule that lets you choose from various death types. To revert your Sim back to a living state, simply select the 'X' on the cause of death icon. Please note that Toddler and Infant Sims cannot become Ghosts, and certain death types are restricted to specific age groups.
After selecting a death trait and transforming your Sim into a Ghost, it’s time to customize! Use the Ghost Overlay toggle to preview your Ghost Sim without the overlay for more detailed customization. You can switch the overlay back on at any time to view your Ghost Sim in the default view!
Identity &amp; Personality
In addition to creating your Sims’s appearance, you can customize their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;identity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nThis covers everything from Age, Gender, and Sexuality to Traits and Aspirations.

The three siblings couldn't bear to let their stern, but loving grandmother go. Bringing her back as a ghost means that her guidance, love, and stern advice will continue on from beyond the grave. 
One Dish of Ambrosia to Bring a Ghost Back to Life!
Giving It All Away
Fortune can always be rebuilt. Go forward with the work ethic your grandmother taught you and see what you can achieve!
Not only did the three siblings learn the importance of family, they also learned the value of giving back. While you'll have to earn your way now, you can be assured your grandmother would be proud. 
Each Sim has grown a new trait to reflect their personality growth!
We Don't Care About Your Money
The world is your oyster now. Be a bum or prove that you can make your own fortune without grandma's help - the choice is yours. 
The three siblings chose not to put on an act for their grandmother's fortune and went so far as to give it away, rather than have it continue to pull their strings. Perhaps this was the best way to be free after all. 
Each Sim has grown a new trait to reflect their journey!
Reshaping the Family
Continue to restructure your household as you see fit! Sims can be added and removed as you see fit in the Manage Households menu.
The three squabbling siblings are no more! Those who remain will have a little more fortune to share, but may find it a little difficult to look in the mirror. 
The remaining siblings have received the Mastermind trait!
Let Grandma Down
Build your own fortune, grow your family, and live your life without your grandmother pulling the strings! Maybe this is actually a good thing?
Maybe you tried, maybe you didn't, but the result was, grandma didn't buy it. The three siblings will have to make ends meet on their own now. 
Grandmother Haunts Us Forever
You may have failed to earn the fortune, but Sims are always capable of redemption. Relationships can be rebuilt, ghosts can be brought back to life, and the approval of a disappointed matriarch can still be won. 
The three siblings failed to convince their grandmother that they genuinely changed. Guilty consciences prevailed, and the trio brought their grandmother back as a ghost to give them yet another lecture.
A Happy Family at Last
Satisfaction Points
Though you might have been lazy or mean in the past, with Re-Traiting Potions and your grandmother's wisdom (and money), you can be anyone you want now. Forge a new legacy for the family!
The three squabbling siblings came together and proved their worth. By getting along as a family and healing the rift between siblings, you showed your grandmother that you're ready to lead the family.

Well Rounded
Some Sims need a little push in the right direction; they need to be shown the ropes, given the rundown, lowdown, and just generally rounded out.\n\nThis is the start of what could be an amazing Sim!

Hi {1.SimFirstName}! We're going off the grid! We're moving out and giving up all technology, including phones. Thanks for all the memories. I'll be thinking of you while I'm foraging in the deep forest.

Why don't you just leave me alone? I'm furious enough with you already! End of conversation?
My problem is I'm dealing with passive aggressive questions from someone who I find infuriating after everything they've done. Now who do you think that is?
Just let me stew in my bitterness in peace. Some things are hard to forget or forgive, &lt;i&gt;okay&lt;/i&gt;?
You shouldn't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to ask. You could say I'm &lt;i&gt;a little&lt;/i&gt; bitter.
I really don't like you very much right now. Just feeling bitter over a few things that I'll get over eventually... Or not.
Hey, this drama isn't my fault... at least not completely. I'm allowed to feel bitter about what's happened between us.

Also known as Sliced Rice Cake Soup, it is a traditional Korean dish eaten during the celebration of the Korean New Year. The dish consists of the broth/soup (guk) with thinly sliced rice cakes (tteok). It is tradition to eat tteokguk on New Year's Day because it is believed to grant the people good luck for the year and gain a year of age.\n\nThe origin of eating tteokguk on New Year's Day is unknown. However, tteokguk is mentioned in the 19th-century book of customs Dongguksesigi (동국세시기, 東國歲時記) with the custom of having a bowl of tteokguk in the morning of New Year's Day to get a year older, and the custom of saying &quot;How many bowls of tteokguk have you eaten?&quot; to ask a person's age.

Cook Steamed Fish
There is a Chinese saying that explains how important fish dishes are to Chinese cuisine: 无鱼不成席 (Wú Yú Bù Chéng Xí) - meaning that you can’t call it a feast if there is no fish present. Fish prepared in this fashion are the centerpiece of a multi-course meal, either for special occasions or festivals.\n\nFor this recipe, the fish is steamed with its tail, head, and fins intact to best preserve the natural taste of the fish. Some people have variations of seasonings to add their special touch, but usually it is seasoned with a simple soy sauce based dressing with scallions and ginger. If you want to add a bit of heat, some dried chili can be added.\n\nLactose Free

These are not merely cheese buns, these are THE cheese buns to go for. Pão de queijo or literally translated to Cheese Bread, is a popular snack and/or breakfast food in Brazil.\n\nIts origins date to when Minas Gerais cooks replaced the non-existent wheat with starch derived from cassava shown to them by tupiniquins indigenous groups. Added this was grated hard cheese similar to Parmesan later at the end of the 19th century.\n\nCuriously, this recipe is also widely eaten in northern Argentina and is inexpensive, often sold from street-side stands by vendors carrying a heat-preserving container. In Brazil, it is also very commonly found in groceries, supermarkets and bakeries, industrialized or freshly made. Enjoy!\n\nVegetarian-Safe

Make Mucenici
Mucenici is a traditional Romanian pastry prepared for the Christian feast of the 40 Martyrs of Sebaste on March 9th. They are created by rolling and shaping dough into figure eights, which represents eternity and remembrance of the soldiers who were persecuted. The pastries embody the cultural heritage of those who observe the day and celebrate culinary tradition, bringing families together to honor the past and welcome spring.\n\nThe preparation method of mucenici varies depending on the region. In Moldova, the famous Moldavian mucenici are made from sweet bread dough. They are baked in the oven, then coated with honey and sprinkled with walnuts. In Muntenia, Oltenia, and Dobrogea, the dough for mucenici is much simpler, with only three ingredients. These are boiled in water with sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon—the water symbolizing the lake where the soldiers were thrown. Although the preparation method differs, their shape has remained unchanged—the figure 8. The enjoyment of mucenici is a communal activity that strengthens family bonds and cultural identity, making it a cherished part of Romanian heritage.

This recipe traditional name is 炸酱面 (Zha Jiang Mian) - fried sauce noodles - and is a dish full of flavor.

Knowing these components have allowed many  to get creative with the ingredients, some people have made this in a vegetarian version with tofu, others have used other meats such as beef or chicken.\n\nLactose Free

Cook Matzo Ball Soup
Matzo Ball Soup isn't just a staple at many Pesach celebrations; it's also the food your bubbe or zayde might make for you when you're feeling a little under the weather as a cure-all.\n\nThe recipe for matzo ball soup has roots in Ashkenazi Jewish cooking in Eastern Europe and is a type of chicken soup with large dumplings made of matzah meal and eggs; the broth has what's known as schmaltz (chicken fat). Matzah on its own is a flatbread served at Pesach, when Jews refrain from eating leavened bread for the duration of the holiday as of a celebration of their escape from enslavement in Egypt.\n\nHistorically, the matzo balls have actually been called knoedel (or knaidel, or kneidel... exact spelling varies) instead of matzo. Now you can enjoy a soup that's as nourishing for the spirit and soul as it is for the body.\n\nLactose Free

Others say that the word came from the Spanish word for &lt;i&gt;there (allá)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;here (acá)&lt;/i&gt;, referencing both Spanish and Venezuelan ingredients coming together.\n\nThe Hallaca represents a gesture of friendship, and if you ever visit a Venezuelan around Christmas time you have to try their Hallacas, and you can't say no. Every family and every region of Venezuela have their own version with their own stew or fixings and fillings, but one thing is certain and that is that everybody can say &lt;i&gt;&quot;Las mejores Hallacas son las de mi mamá&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - The best Hallacas are the ones that Mom makes.\n\nLactose Free

Call the Envoy to Current Lot
When {0.SimFirstName} calls the Envoy, they respond, &quot;Oh, hi! You know, you should really check out Municipal Muses. There's so much to see and do there. It will be a good use of your time!&quot;\n\n{0.SimFirstName} can't help but feel the Envoy is trying to get rid of {0.SimPronounObjective} once again...
{0.SimFirstName} finds the Envoy at their home again.\n\nThe Envoy smiles and says, &quot;Nice work finding two treasures so far! If you win a chess match against me, I’ll share some valuable information about Princess Cordelia Thebe. But I doubt you’ll win…you might want to get some practice in before challenging me!\n\nI'll be at the park waiting, if you are up for the challenge!&quot;
The Thebe Family
The Envoy, surprised and a bit nervous to see {0.SimFirstName} once again, stammers, &quot;Oh! I didn't expect you again so quickly. The Capps, yes...they were quite captivated by romance. Why don't you get into the mindset of love and see if you can whip up any clues. You don't mind if I snoop err—look around here while you're doing that?&quot;

Ask about The Royal Envoy
When {0.SimFirstName} asks about the Royal Envoy, {1.SimFirstName} mentions, &quot;I heard them laughing, saying that they will finally buy that fancy house they wanted. I think I saw them run off towards the Blue Velvet Nightclub...&quot;\n\n...What did the Royal Envoy mean by buying a fancy house? Things don't feel right!
Ask about the Darong Family
Ask about Princess Cordelia
{1.SimFirstName} leans in and says, &quot;You know, despite being part of the royal family, Princess Cordelia was secretly a pirate. She led a double life sailing the seas, seeking hidden treasures, and is rumored to have stolen a vast fortune!&quot;

Ask about Holiday Traditions
For me, the festive season is about getting together with those that mean the most to me. A house full of singing festive songs and dancing together with friends and family is what the holidays have always been about!
My festive traditions? I guess the thing I most fondly remember and always look forward to is getting together and playing some retro video games. They don't make them like they used to!
What do I look forward to the most during the holidays? Definitely the food, and while I enjoy the classics, I like to try traditional foods from different cultures as well.
In my home, you could tell it was that time of the season when all you heard playing on the stereo was the Winter Holiday Station. It was a magical time!
My tradition may seem a little boring to some but since this time of year can be so hectic I mainly look forward to just relaxing with others and watching TV!

Hey, nobody’s perfect. Half-right is better than all-wrong.
Whoops. Turns out {0.SimFirstName} should have paid more attention. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss screams, “You were supposed to fix ALL the mistakes! How else am I supposed to look good?”
{M0.He}{F0.She} just couldn’t make {M0.his}{F0.her} case, so the studio hired another writer. The movie bombs at the box office and now they might not make the next one at all!
{0.SimFirstName} writes the screenplay {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, and it’s a smash. {M0.His}{F0.Her} contract even guarantees {0.SimPronounObjective} more money this time!
{0.SimFirstName} has proof of all the misdeeds, and the politician can’t deny it. The article is a sensation.
The politician denies everything, so it’s his word against {0.SimFirstName}’s. But since he’s the politician, {0.SimFirstName}’s the one who looks bad.

After {0.SimFirstName} reasons with him, the former fan realizes that things aren’t so bad. In fact, he’s actually grateful for more advice!

Even though the fans themselves asked for it, they hate it. The book tanks.
Everyone loves the new book! {0.SimFirstName} even found a believable way to bring the character back from the dead. Turns out his death was faked to bring the team together!
This one was just too much for {0.SimFirstName}, and {M0.he}{F0.she} blew it. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she}’ll be able to handle it when {M0.he}{F0.she} has more experience.
{0.SimFirstName} worked hard and did a great job. Everyone on staff was impressed, and the sacrifice was worth it.
Stay with Paper
Go Electronic
{0.SimFirstName} presses on {M0.his}{F0.her} headset and tries to focus, but an overexcited fan crashes into {0.SimPronounObjective} and spills “N-ergy Drynk” all over the keyboard. Photos of the resulting brawl quickly go viral, which doesn’t do much for {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation.
Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} makes a fabulous presentation. If only the partner had heard it! After a round of thanks and handshakes, {0.SimFirstName} is sent on {M0.his}{F0.her} way, none the richer for {M0.his}{F0.her} time.
Yes! {0.SimFirstName} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} system rebuilt just in time for the tournament. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fingers fly through the mouse- and key-clicks with deadly accuracy, earning {0.SimPronounObjective} thousands of Simoleons in prize money and a streaming video deal.
At first no one answers, until the new intern shifts to let {0.SimFirstName} see his screen. It’s a doctored-up photo all right, but the ax-wielding mutant isn’t {0.SimFirstName}. It’s {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, which is easy enough to laugh off.
Whoops! Who knew blackwater fever is actually a complication of malaria? Apparently, the company {0.SimFirstName} was supposed to be speaking for does. After all, it’s a media company, packed with journalists who live to sniff out lies. {0.SimFirstName} takes a beating online, but at least {M0.he}{F0.she} can let it blow over while {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} on {M0.his}{F0.her} retreat.
Blissfully ignoring all incoming emails, {0.SimFirstName} manages to get a lot of work done. Unfortunately, none of it was the high priority work that the production team was trying to assign to {M0.him}{F0.her}. Now the team will have to scramble to pull an important demo together!
{0.SimFirstName} has done {M0.his}{F0.her} homework and it shows! Surprised but pleased at the attention, the partner sets down his phone and begins to question {0.SimFirstName}, giving {0.SimFirstName} ample opportunity to demonstrate {M0.his}{F0.her} thinking and secure some seed funding.
Looks like the old flame is still full of fire. By the time {0.SimFirstName}’s manager picks up the chat, he gets a blazing tirade, which he kindly passes on to {0.SimFirstName}. It is easily the worst service call of {M0.his}{F0.her} career.
Fat chance finding anyone in this gamers’ paradise. By the time {0.SimFirstName} elbows {M0.his}{F0.her} way past the warrior queens, zombies, and plumbers, {M0.his}{F0.her} shift is already over and {M0.his}{F0.her} boss is furious.
The media company is angry about the cancellation-{0.SimFirstName}’s picture is all over their marketing-but hey, blackwater fever is no joke. {0.SimFirstName} pulls off the lie, and is smart enough to lay low until {M0.his}{F0.her} suntan fades.
Well, the table isn’t a problem anymore, but {0.SimFirstName} didn’t avoid confronting {M0.his}{F0.her} team. Forced to explain why {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t just say something, {M0.he}{F0.she} loses the loyalty of key employees, who head for greener pastures.
{0.SimFirstName} should have done a little research before vouching for {M0.his}{F0.her} colleague. When the ugly truth is dragged into the light, {0.SimFirstName} is accused of colluding and {M0.his}{F0.her} company’s stock plummets.
WAR MEADOW 6 is totally amazing, a huge jump forward from the 5th one that came out four months ago. And {0.SimFirstName} should have plenty of time to check it out, since {M0.his}{F0.her} boss will never let {0.SimPronounObjective} demo a game again!
Great managers know when to stay above the riff-raff. Whatever the joke was, it passes, and {0.SimFirstName} is happy to see more camaraderie on {M0.his}{F0.her} team.
{0.SimFirstName} manages to make a joke of the whole thing, charming the audience and moderator with {M0.his}{F0.her} humor and charisma. The moderator gives {0.SimPronounObjective} extra opportunities to show off {M0.his}{F0.her} expertise, gaining {0.SimPronounObjective} valuable contacts at the event.
{0.SimFirstName} has either overestimated {M0.his}{F0.her} skills or underestimated the project. Sure, nobody else in this cubicle pit could do better, but when deadlines slip and bugs appear, everyone looks {0.SimFirstName}’s way.
Lucky for {0.SimFirstName}, the relationship wasn’t as memorable as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought—or at least, the flame doesn’t acknowledge {M0.his}{F0.her} name or chat picture. {0.SimFirstName} meets this customer’s service needs, and avoids an awkward confrontation.
Without the interference, {0.SimFirstName} is able to clear everything off {M0.his}{F0.her} plate in record time. Not bad! Now {M0.he}{F0.she} should be able to take some time and get to the root of the producer’s problems.
Success! {0.SimFirstName} presents the game up the chain without the CEO’s changes. Everyone loves it-except the CEO-but by now it has so much momentum that he green lights it as is.
Hang Tight
Phew! A press release reveals that the competitor’s product isn’t even targeted at the same market and has a radically different feature set than {0.SimFirstName}’s. Succeed or fail, it won’t have an impact on {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
{0.SimFirstName} strains to drown out the noise and becomes hyper-focused on the game. {M0.He}{F0.She} sees and hears nothing except his enemies evaporating in {M0.his}{F0.her} crosshairs. {0.SimFirstName} wins the round by a wide margin, and Furball and his friends go wild!
The problem with attacking popular people is that they’re really, really popular. The sponsor drops {0.SimFirstName} like a hot coal, but at least no one can blame {M0.him}{F0.her} when the team gets destroyed in the first round.
Patience never was a virtue of this particular ex, so {0.SimFirstName} is rid of the problem quickly. {M0.He}{F0.She} can now spend {M0.his}{F0.her} time on more important pursuits, like completely disguising {M0.his}{F0.her} profile picture.
The sponsor suggests a practice round with software to track APM. Luckily, the numbers prove {0.SimFirstName} right, and the weak link is dropped before any real damage is done.
Whoops. A press release reveals that the competitor’s product is not only targeted at the same market segment, but it has a radically larger feature set than {0.SimFirstName}’s. Furious that {0.SimFirstName} didn’t see it coming, management kills {M0.his}{F0.her} project.
{0.SimFirstName} hasn’t made it this far for nothing. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} played tired before, and {M0.he}{F0.she} can certainly do it now. Three deep breaths, and {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} in the zone…and crushing it.
Just as {0.SimFirstName} predicted, the self-promoting superstar makes a pitiful showing. Unfortunately, the sponsor doesn’t know enough about gaming to see who the weak link is. Everyone is dropped and the team is disbanded. And Mr. Superstar will probably have another deal lined up by tomorrow...
LAN party foul! A grown adult sweating in a fur suit for the entertainment of a few hundred gamers is sad enough, but getting dressed down by {0.SimFirstName} is just pathetic. The crowd quickly takes the Furball’s side and now {0.SimFirstName} has to contend with raucous jeers!
Welp, that’s enough from THAT 9-year-old! {0.SimFirstName} boots him, and even though the squad has to play the next match a man down, without the distracting child to deal with, they coordinate and dominate.
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} makes it to the booth, and just in time for {M0.his}{F0.her} shift! Seeing gamers play the game for the first time is a blast, the event is a huge success, and there’s still plenty of time to hit the show floor!
It takes time, and {0.SimFirstName} has to set all of {M0.his}{F0.her} other work aside, but {M0.he}{F0.she} finally manages to give the producer what he needed. In the next team meeting, the grateful producer calls {0.SimFirstName} out for going above and beyond.
Ahh. That smells better, though it would take at least 3 more bottles to really rid the place of the offending odor.  Foul Boy is, of course, the only tester in the pit to complain about the {M0.men’s body spray}{F0.air freshener} smell.
The moderator seems to take it in stride, but a few minutes into the panel, it’s clear she has it out for {0.SimFirstName}. After humiliating {M0.him}{F0.her} in front of the audience and the mirthful press, she makes sure {0.SimFirstName}’s name is correct in the resulting coverage.
Ah, the joys of technology. It isn’t as easy to coordinate tactics when one of your squadmates is silent, but it’s far less distracting this way. Besides, this smart-mouthed 9-year-old has to go to bed sometime, right?
{0.SimFirstName} can’t risk permanent damage to {M0.his}{F0.her} system with a rush repair job. {0.SimFirstName} plays the tourney on a machine {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} never used before. The results aren’t pretty.
Apparently, all those energy drinks have Foul Boy a bit tense. He storms out, swearing that {0.SimFirstName} sucks, the job sucks, {0.SimFirstName} sucks, life sucks, and did he mention that everyone on the whole QA team sucks? But it does smell better now.
At the official pitch meeting, {0.SimFirstName} can’t seem to present a single concept without the CEO challenging {M0.him}{F0.her}. The other execs, sensing the negative energy, kill the project before it even gets a chance.
Nothing is wrong with the company books, and reporters soon discover that the CFO’s jilted ex is responsible for the entire mess. Nobody blames {0.SimFirstName} for investigating, except maybe the CFO, but he has bigger problems to worry about at the moment.
Well, it isn’t {0.SimFirstName}’s best performance by a long shot, but then nobody’s on their game…except the new girl {0.SimFirstName} has been smack-talking with the most. She destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And then the press destroys {M0.him}{F0.her} some more.
Oh dear, Foul Boy has a foul mouth, and {0.SimFirstName} is getting the brunt of it. While Foul Boy unleashes a tirade against {M0.him}{F0.her}, the other testers take advantage and log several bugs that {0.SimFirstName} could have discovered.
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t sure whether {M0.he}{F0.she} comes off as gracious or spineless, but {M0.he}{F0.she} makes a much better impression than the moderator, who proceeds to flub her way through the session. The panel is completely ignored by the press, which is probably best for everyone.
Upper management panics and decides to rush {0.SimFirstName}’s product to market, bugs and all. This can only lead to poor reviews and disappointing sales. Meanwhile the competitor gets to glide to success as the “improved” product. Infuriating!
Way to dig in and get the job done, {0.SimFirstName}! Sure, it might take some longer days (or weeks) to get up to speed, but {M0.his}{F0.her} manager praises {M0.his}{F0.her} initiative, even if she offers no OT.
This time, work comes first! {0.SimFirstName} delivers a thought-provoking keynote that generates great press for {M0.his}{F0.her} company, and then makes up for the lost vacation day with a few indulgent after-parties.
{0.SimFirstName} emails the concept to a few other studios, but no one bites. And now {M0.his}{F0.her} own studio has moved on to a new idea. {0.SimFirstName}’s game has joined countless other great concepts in limbo.
{0.SimFirstName} is a popular Sim, and {M0.his}{F0.her} employees respect {M0.him}{F0.her} for being direct. The pool table is reserved for the weekly company happy hour and productivity goes up.
The great thing about being the {M0.King}{F0.Queen} is practicing on all the free mice and keyboards corporations send you. While the replacements aren’t {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite brand, {0.SimFirstName} is familiar with them and quickly gets a feel for the new controls. Victory is imminent!
{0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not the only one who can’t take any more of this hateful 9-year-old’s outbursts, but it sure feels like it when {M0.his}{F0.her} squad realizes they have to play the next match a man down. They rebel and refuse to coordinate. The match is a disaster.
Phew! Reporters soon discover that the CFO’s jilted ex is responsible for the entire mess. Reassured by the solidarity within the leadership team, shareholders invest more and the company’s stock recovers.
Embarrassed and angry at being called out, the partner answers {0.SimFirstName}’s question rudely and begins to attack {M0.his}{F0.her} plan. {0.SimFirstName} tries to recover, but when the partner claims to have another meeting, {M0.he}{F0.she} is met with the door.
Nobody seems to hear {0.SimFirstName}, becoming suddenly very focused on work. Too nervous to take it any further, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets it go, losing even more face and drawing more snickers.
Well, that didn’t go well. An employee points out that they’re all working for shares, and could be making bank elsewhere. They obviously have faith in the company; it’s {0.SimFirstName} who needs to believe in them. More people chime in, then pack up and walk out.
{0.SimFirstName} feels a bit sheepish for leaving early, but embarrassing {M0.himself}{F0.herself} in front of a few fellow pros isn’t nearly so bad as doing it for the press. Luckily everyone is too distracted to notice when {M0.he}{F0.she} exits stage right.
Kudos to {0.SimFirstName} for having the guts to ask for help! Unfortunately, nobody here has the first idea of how to do it, either, especially {M0.his}{F0.her} manager. And she would rather see {0.SimFirstName} sink than her.

A bird in hand is always nice. {0.SimFirstName} walks away with plenty of dough to seed {M0.his}{F0.her} next venture, but not without angering {M0.his}{F0.her} staff. Some of {M0.his}{F0.her} best talent walk out, which puts a kink in future plans.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a few notes, draws an incredibly unflattering caricature of the teacher—and vows to return with a masterpiece next time.
Oh no! {0.SimFirstName} tried having an open juice bar, and somebody spilled a Simsmapolitan into an urn from 5,000 B.C.
The first few hours of painting through the pain are tough, but {0.SimFirstName} finally gets a grip and finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} creative work, along with {M0.his}{F0.her} chores.
{0.SimFirstName} places an annoyed call to the gallery owner, who offers to buy the painting from {0.SimFirstName}. Sale! 
Yikes! {0.SimFirstName}'s table is hit by a passing bike, and now several canvasses are marred by tire tracks.
Although it's hard to ignore the smell of that curdled milk, {0.SimFirstName} does manage to ignore the artist. They paint in relative peace.
{0.SimFirstName} goes head-to-head with the abstract artist, in front of everyone in the  painters' group, and comes out sounding far more intelligent. 
The painting sold on name recognition alone, and {0.SimFirstName} now feels responsible for saving a poodle from life on the streets.
The exhibition was horribly organized, with strange curatorial choices. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} didn't take the bribe!
Why learn the hard way, by making mistakes, when other artists already have it figured out? {0.SimFirstName} teachers theory, and the students' artwork looks smarter and smarter.
At the last minute, {0.SimFirstName} is outbid by another buyer. {M0.He}{F0.She} wasn't the only one to realize what a deal this was!
The top comment on the article says, &quot;Obviously, I agree with {0.SimFirstName}'s scathing review of 'Call Me: The Artist Built With Smartphones.' That piece was self-indulgent non-art. {0.SimFirstName} totally called it.&quot; 
Despite {0.SimFirstName}'s criticism, art appraisers around the globe lose their jobs as the Appraise-Bot is also turned into a free app for smartphones.
{0.SimFirstName} announces an Ancient Art mixer. People can dress in togas and olive branches! Before {M0.he}{F0.she} knows it dozens of people have signed up for the event. This looks good!
Oops. The students' enthusiasm is admirable, but maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have discussed theories on perspective BEFORE they painted the city skyline.
{0.SimFirstName} rallies other artists, and before too long, everyone is fired up to move post-post-post-retro-cubist-fauv-modern-eccentricism forward. How long until it evolves another &quot;post?&quot;
With a little mild soap and water, the stain disappears, leaving the painting unblemished. Phew!
{0.SimFirstName} places an annoyed call to the gallery owner, who refuses to take responsibility or ever to work with {0.SimFirstName} again.
The left ear appears to be falling off, the legs are out of proportion with the torso, and the nose looks broken. But other than that, it's fine!
Some work time was wasted, but {0.SimFirstName} found another model and completed a different, and amazing, portfolio piece. 
The painting sold for the cost of a can of dog food. That's not going to make much of a difference.
Viewers find the palm tree costume immature and offensive. The &quot;Island Art&quot; exhibition is not well attended.
{0.SimFirstName}'s angry rambling about {M0.his}{F0.her} painting earns {0.SimPronounObjective} the nickname &quot;Baby Cranks.&quot; Isn't school fun?
The garden runs wild, but when the farm owners see {0.SimFirstName}'s heartwarming painting of baby piglets, it all seems worth it. 
{0.SimFirstName}'s intelligent defense of {M0.his}{F0.her} work impresses classmates and the teacher. The critic hadn't considered that perspective.
Setting aside the text book,  {0.SimFirstName} allows student to learn by doing. This results in many stellar paintings and a lot of very positive feedback for {0.SimFirstName}.
{0.SimFirstName} makes zero money but walks away from the evening with some new contacts in the art community.
{0.SimFirstName} scans one of {M0.his}{F0.her} paintings and the AB-2000 quickly spits out a very unflattering score. Clearly the machine is broken. Luckily the gadget doesn't seem to be catching on.
The manifesto is published in a very popular art blog and quickly goes viral. Now everyone is practicing post-post-post-retro-cubist-fauv-modern-eccentricism. 
{0.SimFirstName} finds a quiet place to sleep it off, and wakes up re-fueled to clean extra hard. 
{0.SimFirstName}'s upcoming show quickly becomes the most anticipated among critics. They flip out when {0.SimFirstName} explains that the medium is also edible. 
The student learns that {0.SimFirstName} is claiming to have invented the technique for {M0.his}{F0.her} upcoming show and files a complaint with the university.
{0.SimFirstName}'s boss thinks {M0.he}{F0.she} is faking it, and {M0.he}{F0.she} gets a long lecture on professional conduct.
{0.SimFirstName} goes head-to-head with the abstract artist, in front of everyone in the painters' group, and comes out sounding old fashioned and out of it.
{0.SimFirstName} loses {M0.his}{F0.her} chance to have a body-painted piece featured in the magazine, but saves {M0.his}{F0.her} dignity by not trying to slap paint onto {M0.his}{F0.her} own skin.
Go classic, and you can't go wrong. {0.SimFirstName} looks great, is well spoken, and draws a decent crowd to the museum.
{0.SimFirstName} can't get the manifesto published anywhere. {M0.He}{F0.She} quietly hosts it on a personal website, which no one visits, and the movement dies a quick death.
That guerilla street artist, working on the side of trains, is the talk of the art world. With sponsorship from {0.SimFirstName}, the artist is able to hold his first gallery show. Everyone raves about it.
Viewers are caught off guard to see a talking palm tree, and many of them come to see the exhibition.
{0.SimFirstName}'s latest painting sells for more than anything else at the auction! By far! Surely the poodles shall write songs and poems of {0.SimFirstName}'s legendary generosity.
The magazine had never before featured an artist using {M0.his}{F0.her} body as a canvas. {0.SimFirstName}'s work is praised. 
The museum displays {0.SimFirstName}'s collection in a back room, with poor lighting. Maybe a new wing wouldn't have been such a bad idea.
{0.SimFirstName} keeps the student after class, for a stern talking to and more homework. The student quits on the spot and runs off to study with a local graffiti artist.
With extra attention, the class clown agrees to focus more on his technique. He soon seems to be making some progress using unconventional colors.
&quot;Still Life of a Barn&quot; doesn't push any boundaries. But its exquisite detail at least rounds out {0.SimFirstName}'s portfolio.

{0.SimFirstName}'s explanation that  the artist's most famous work, &quot;Is just a red square with a blue dot!&quot; draws several annoyed stares and a unanimous, &quot;You just don't get it.&quot; from the crowd.
{0.SimFirstName}'s explanation that the artist's most famous work, &quot;Is just a red square with a blue dot!&quot; draws several, &quot;I was thinking that, too!&quot; admissions from colleagues. Good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} spoke up!

Hands-On Approach

Try the Demo
Discredit Machine
{0.SimFirstName} finally pulls {M0.his}{F0.her} nose out of an art history book, brain overflowing with valuable data, only to see that class ended 20 minutes ago. Uh-oh.
Preparing is for mortals. A genius lives in the moment. {0.SimFirstName} crams like crazy and aces the exam.
Missing Model
{0.SimFirstName} is supposed to apply body paint to a model for a magazine shoot, but the model never showed! Thinking fast, {0.SimFirstName} realizes the only choices are to paint {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, or to cancel the photo shoot.
Museum Collection
A major museum wants to buy {0.SimFirstName} 's entire collection. Should {0.SimFirstName} sell the collection outright, or tell the museum they also have to build an honorary {0.SimFirstName} wing in which to display it?
Discussion Etiquette
Everyone is raving about the new work by the university's visiting artist. {0.SimFirstName} may decide to offer the counter opinion that the visiting artist is an overinflated hack, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could go along with popular consensus that his work changes art as we know it?
Residency Exchange
{0.SimFirstName} must do farm chores in exchange for {M0.his}{F0.her} artist residency. But raking in the garden has caused blisters to form on {M0.his}{F0.her} hand. Now holding a paintbrush hurts! Which begs the question: Skip the chores or toughen up?
Artistically Late
{0.SimFirstName} arrives late to the local art walk, and there's no more sidewalk space left to set up a table and sell watercolors. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could set up half in the street? Or would it be better to give up and just spend the night schmoozing? 
Oddly Heated Discussion
An artist who uses odd mediums, such as dirty bathwater and curdled milk, is always trying to engage {0.SimFirstName} in a heated discussion. Should {0.SimFirstName} argue art theory with her or ignore her?
{0.SimFirstName} is molding local art majors into tomorrow's virtuosos. {M0.He}{F0.She} just can't decide on the best approach to curriculum: let them get their hands dirty, or lecture them on theory instead?
Appraise-Bot 2000
{0.SimFirstName} is shocked to hear about &quot;Appraise-Bot 2000,&quot; a machine that studies brush strokes, color characteristics and 56 other key elements, spitting out an appraisal—in under 30 seconds. {0.SimFirstName} can either discredit the machine publicly, or try the Appraise-Bot 2000's free demo.
Interview Attire
{0.SimFirstName} will be interviewed by the local news about {M0.his}{F0.her} recently curated exhibition of &quot;Island Art.&quot; As a publicity stunt, should {M0.he}{F0.she} dress in the palm tree costume or just go with dress slacks and a nice shirt?
Bad Image
One day, at {0.SimFirstName}'s part-time art magazine job, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a bad reference image. Adjusting the layout is an option. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could just replace the image with {M0.his}{F0.her} own work.
The class clown in {0.SimFirstName}'s after school art program mixes the entire class supply of purple and yellow, creating something between &quot;pea soup&quot; and &quot;muddy rainwater.&quot; Is it better to keep Mr. Laugh Riot after class for extra tutoring—or boot him?
Harsh Critiques
{0.SimFirstName}'s work is being critiqued for the first time, and the response is especially harsh. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} get defensive and try to explain {M0.his}{F0.her} thought process, or quietly take notes and try to do better in the future?
Browsing through an art brokerage website, {0.SimFirstName} notices that a certain painting has been grossly undervalued. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take advantage of this deep discount, or contact the site to have them correct the mistake? 
Attendance at the museum has dropped since  {0.SimFirstName} took over as curator. To turn it around (and save {0.SimFirstName}'s reputation), should {M0.he}{F0.she} suggest the museum start holding social events or begin offering community classes?
The artist residency at this farm means two whole months for {0.SimFirstName} to create the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; for {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio. Which leads to the question: experimental work or something more mainstream?
Portfolio Piece
{0.SimFirstName} hired a model to sit for {M0.his}{F0.her} final portfolio piece, but after two sessions, the model leaves town for a family emergency.  {0.SimFirstName} will now need to finish the piece from memory—or start over.
A Review Bribe
{0.SimFirstName} is reviewing an exhibition for a major art magazine. On the sly, the gallery curator offers to show one of {0.SimFirstName}'s paintings later in exchange for a favorable review. Will {0.SimFirstName} accept the bribe—or be fair?
Manifesto 
{0.SimFirstName} may have invented a new movement: post-post-post-retro-cubist-fauv-modern-eccentricism. Is the next step writing a manifesto for the movement, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to convert more artists first?
A new gallery is calling for work. {0.SimFirstName} knows their last show was traditional, but {M0.he}{F0.she} just finished rolling around on canvases, covered in mustard, for a series entitled &quot;U = My Sunshine.&quot;  Should {0.SimFirstName} bring them the edgy work, or play it safe?
Forgotten Test
For an ART school, there sure is a lot of essay writing. {0.SimFirstName} has been so focused on developing {M0.his}{F0.her} craft that {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot the big essay test today! There's just enough time for a cram session, or to pull together a study group.
Fumes
{0.SimFirstName} accidentally inhales some turpentine fumes while cleaning the community ed room. Would a responsible employee take a rest and recover, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} power through the shift?
Grandfather Portrait
What began as a moving portrait of a grandfather's weathered face is looking more and more like an oatmeal cookie. {0.SimFirstName} can keep painting, or re-title it and call it done.
{0.SimFirstName} has a little capital from selling a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} private collection, which can either be used to sponsor an upcoming artist or to reinvest for the future. What to do?
Exhibit Label
Cleaning the museum one night, {0.SimFirstName} notices an exhibit label may list the incorrect artist. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} report it, proving {M0.his}{F0.her} masterful grasp of art history — or just use {M0.his}{F0.her} time to finish mopping?
Stained
After the big gallery show, one of {0.SimFirstName}'s paintings is returned to {M0.him}{F0.her} with a stain on the corner. Is it time to yell at the gallery owner, or try to remove the stain?
{0.SimFirstName} has been tapped to review a popular art show for one of the top art blogs. Is this an opportunity to give it to readers straight, or to remember that art is subjective?
New Technique
A promising young art student in {0.SimFirstName}'s class discovers the brilliant technique of &quot;raw goat's milk yogurt tempera painting.&quot; {0.SimFirstName} could now borrow this technique for {M0.his}{F0.her} upcoming big show, or let the student have credit.
The charity art auction needs {0.SimFirstName}'s work to raise money for homeless poodles. {M0.His}{F0.Her} recent stuff is worth more. But that means more money for the poodles and less for {0.SimFirstName}. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} just give them an older painting?
Dress Slacks, Nice Shirt
Palm Tree Costume
Adjust Layout
Replace With Own Art
{0.SimFirstName} forgets about the label and, in record time, finishes polishing every square inch of the museum floor into a blank canvas for tomorrow's feet.
Extra Tutoring
Boot Him
Art is all about expression, but c'mon... {0.SimFirstName} boots the troublesome student and now has the class—and the color mixing—back under control.
Quietly Take Notes
Defend the Art
{0.SimFirstName} was wrong -- the label was accurate! Now {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll}  never get that big promotion to gift shop cashier.
{0.SimFirstName} was correct! It wasn't even a cubist work. It was a replica of an ancient cave painting!  Who would mislabel that?!
{0.SimFirstName} waits until the cafeteria monitor is near, then shouts for the mean kid to unhand {M0.his}{F0.her} food. The monitor quickly walks over and scolds the mean kid in front of everybody. All that AND {0.SimFirstName} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} bag of chips too!
{0.SimFirstName} shrugs. Squirms. Then tries to explain about hard work and trying your best and how goofing off just makes you look dumb. It sounds right to {0.SimPronounObjective}, but the spitball that whizzes by {M0.his}{F0.her} head tells {0.SimPronounObjective} that wasn’t the right answer.
{0.SimFirstName} finishes the last few questions correctly and decides to hope for the best. The school likes to brag about its test scores, but how much can one test matter? Unfortunately, the teacher thinks it matters a LOT. She assigns extra work for the next month to ensure that {0.SimFirstName} catches up.
{0.SimFirstName} picks a seat way in the back where the girl won’t go (too far from the board). Of course, now it’s a lot harder to see the teacher write on the board and {0.SimFirstName}’s not getting called on anymore…
{0.SimFirstName} scribbles a note and passes it back to the kid: “Stop or I’ll tell.” The kid wads up the paper and fires it at {0.SimFirstName}, but it misses and rolls up to the teacher’s feet. For once, somebody else gets in trouble, and {0.SimFirstName} gets off scot free! 
{0.SimFirstName} is just placing the cookie into the open bag when a loudmouth kid accuses {M0.him}{F0.her} of going through someone else’s lunch! Before {0.SimFirstName} can answer, the teacher appears and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} write an apology, up on the board where everyone can see. No good deed...
It’s not always the best move to involve the teacher, but seeing as {0.SimFirstName}’s only in grade school it’s not the worst idea. Caught with marker still on his hands, the culprit is sent to the principal and worse, home to his furious mom.
{0.SimFirstName} knows better than to chew someone else’s gum, especially with all the flu bugs going around. Unfortunately, {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher finds it at Free Time and makes {0.SimPronounObjective} scrape all the desks. So unfair!
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} feels so much better with a few SugarBops in {M0.his}{F0.her} tummy, and the teacher didn’t even notice. {M0.He}{F0.She} even snuck a few to {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor, who traded a cool sticker for them.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t get all the words right, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does get a few letters right in each word! Besides, {M0.he}{F0.she} gave it {M0.his}{F0.her} best effort, and that’s what counts the most, right?
{0.SimFirstName} stuffs the cookie into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth, hurriedly brushing away crumbs. Chocolate chip—awesome! {M0.He}{F0.She} is so energetic in class afterwards that {M0.he}{F0.she} even earns a star for enthusiasm.
Who needs a friend like that anyway? {0.SimFirstName} tunes it out and plays with the new {M0.boy}{F0.girl} at recess. Later, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds the invite in {M0.his}{F0.her} cubby, buried under a stale bag of pretzels. Oops!
{0.SimFirstName} tries to shuffle over to the hooks where {M0.he}{F0.she} keeps a {M0. sweatshirt}{F0. sweater}, but before {M0.he}{F0.she} can tie it around {M0.his}{F0.her} waist, an older kid shouts, “EWW! That kid wet {M0.his}{F0.her} pants!” Everyone stares. {0.SimFirstName} borrows pants from Lost &amp; Found to wear for the rest of the day.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to take pride in {M0.his}{F0.her} work and not risk getting a late mark. Brandishing {M0.his}{F0.her} poster, {M0.he}{F0.she} turns it in, earning a flaccid smile from the teacher and a bright red B.
{0.SimFirstName} thinks hard—where would {M0.he}{F0.she} go if {M0.he}{F0.she} were a tiny, fluffy critter often surrounded by screaming children? Up on the shelves? Behind the toilet? Inside Mr. Bones? By the time the teacher comes in, the lab is a mess and Fluffy’s still missing.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher sees {0.SimPronounObjective} doodling and comes over to check {M0.his}{F0.her} work. Frowning, she picks up the paper, circles 5 spelling errors and insists that {0.SimFirstName} use the remaining time to do it all over again.
Pretending to concentrate, {0.SimFirstName} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes and recites the letters the girl showed him. “Incorrect,” snaps the proctor. {0.SimFirstName} loses! The brainiac falls off her chair laughing, along with half the room. It was a mean trick!
Sometimes adults are smarter than they look. {0.SimFirstName} shuffles to the front and asks to go see the school nurse. The teacher says {M0.he}{F0.she} can go...right after the test!
{0.SimFirstName} nudges {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor with an elbow, and the kid makes his way to the stage. The poor kid is given cymbals and asked to “improvise.” What follows is a noisy, embarrassing mess that will stay with the boy for years. Yikes!
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} manages to unzip {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack just enough to get a good look at the words. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t get all the words right, since they are still covered in doodles, but then getting a perfect score would make {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher suspicious.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to quell {M0.his}{F0.her} anxiety by taking big, deep breaths, and what do you know, it works! Sure, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates shoot {0.SimPronounObjective} some funny looks, but when you’re an A student you have to take every test seriously!
{0.SimFirstName} sits back while the other kid takes the stage. The kid looks pretty embarrassed as he’s asked to “improvise” something on bongos. But before {0.SimFirstName} can laugh, the music teacher calls {M0.him}{F0.her} up to play back-up on rainstick. That’s not even a real instrument!
{0.SimFirstName} stashes {M0.his}{F0.her} poster in the hall. Later, at recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} goes to recover it and cover it with silvery marker swirls, only to find it gone! Someone threw it out! Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to start all over AND take a late grade!
Yep, Ballistic Watermelon—yum! {0.SimFirstName} chews happily through the rest of the class, feeling pleased if a little queasy.
{0.SimFirstName} slides quickly under the bleachers, wedging {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into a nice shady spot. Unfortunately, lying down in the shade is a little too restful. When {0.SimFirstName} awakes, Coach is glaring down at {0.SimPronounObjective}. Now everyone has to watch {0.SimFirstName} finish {M0.his}{F0.her} laps!
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is not pleased at all with {M0.his}{F0.her} timely achievement. Frowning, she picks up the paper, circles 5 spelling errors and insists that {M0.he}{F0.she} use the remaining time to do it all over again.
This is {0.SimFirstName}’s chance to show off {M0.his}{F0.her} talents! Up to the front {M0.he}{F0.she} goes, where the teacher hands {0.SimPronounObjective} some cymbals. Crash-bang! This is one performance no one will forget, not for a long time.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to wait it out and see if anyone comes forward. Sure enough at lunch some friends laugh and wave to {M0.him}{F0.her}. “Hey, Cutie!” one taunts. {0.SimFirstName} wads up the note and tosses it at them, laughing along with the joke. Someday it’ll happen for real, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} relieved it’s not today.
Oops. Turns out the party wasn’t even for {0.SimFirstName}’s friend—it was only a show on TV! {0.SimFirstName} feels a little silly, but very glad {M0.he}{F0.she} asked.
The mean kid swipes {0.SimFirstName}’s brownie, just as expected. But what the bully WON’T be expecting is a brownie full of laxatives! Unfortunately, before {0.SimFirstName} can enjoy a self-satisfied chuckle, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the mean kid offer the brownie to the principal in an effort to suck up! Oh no!!
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t think {M0.his}{F0.her} answer is all that funny, but for some reason, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are falling off their seats laughing. Wow! Great crowd! {0.SimFirstName} has definitely got this.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is busy writing on the board. Shuffling the top paper under {M0.his}{F0.her} shirt, {0.SimFirstName} excuses {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to the bathroom. Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} is followed by the owner of the paper, who takes {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch in exchange for silence.
{0.SimFirstName} hides the plane in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack until recess. By the time {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to the playground, the nose is bent and the thing won’t fly straight. Back to the drawing board…
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} tells the teacher what happened, and the teacher helps {0.SimPronounObjective} transfer {M0.his}{F0.her} answers onto a new form. Just enough time to finish the rest of the test!
Yes! {0.SimFirstName}’s plane does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing on the substitute’s desk. Amazingly, the sub still doesn’t see it, but {0.SimFirstName} scores points with {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, who do.
{0.SimFirstName} glances around and decides it’s too risky. But imagining that cool shade helps {0.SimPronounObjective} pick up a little speed! {0.SimFirstName} finishes all {M0.his}{F0.her} laps with a new personal best time!
{0.SimFirstName} jumps off the bench, shouting, “Gross! What WAS that?” {M0.His}{F0.Her} friends laugh, but “with” {0.SimPronounObjective} more than “at” {0.SimPronounObjective}. Phew!
{0.SimFirstName} runs into the hall, shouting, “Fluffy is loose! Fluffy is loose!” Soon the lab is packed with kids on a rescue mission, and the gerbil is recovered in no time. With all the commotion, no one thinks to ask how he escaped, and {0.SimFirstName} decides it can stay between {M0.him}{F0.her} and Fluffy, this time.
Up to the front {0.SimFirstName} goes, where the teacher hands {M0.him}{F0.her} some cymbals. Crash-bang! {M0.He}{F0.She} makes so much noise {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t even notice the teacher’s cries for {M0.him}{F0.her} to stop—not until the principal snatches the cymbals away. Oops.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is very pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} focus and effort. After all, {M0.he}{F0.she} rarely finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} assignments at all, so why would the teacher expect pictures? {0.SimFirstName} even gets the coveted gold star!
Lunch is almost over when the class bully notices the bib on the floor. He can’t wait to find the “little baby” who dropped it, but the new kid says nothing and neither does {0.SimFirstName}, who may have just made a new friend.
{0.SimFirstName} places {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe over the bib and grabs it when {M0.he}{F0.she} thinks no one is looking. Unfortunately, the class bully IS looking and immediately starts calling {0.SimPronounObjective} a little baby. Little help here, new kid? No??
Well, this time at least, being honest doesn’t pay. {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher makes {0.SimPronounObjective} help out the nurse while {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates go on the trip.
Well, that didn’t go well. {0.SimFirstName} only got a shrug for an answer, and now {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is actively avoiding {0.SimPronounObjective}. Oh well, who needs a friend like that anyway? *sigh*
The girl seems happy enough and {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t really know her. Unfortunately, some older kids notice, too, and they start pointing and laughing loudly. The girl cries. {0.SimFirstName} can’t help but feel that all of this could have been avoided.
To take {M0.his}{F0.her} mind off lunch, {0.SimFirstName} actually pays attention to the lesson. Wow, how cool—{0.SimFirstName} is really and truly learning something today!
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is very pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} extra effort. Of course, {0.SimFirstName} could have spent the time checking {M0.his}{F0.her} work for spelling errors, but baby steps are fine for now. {0.SimFirstName} gets a gold star!
{0.SimFirstName} shrugs. Squirms. Then tells the truth. “I’m smart?” {M0.He}{F0.She} wasn’t trying to be funny, but the laughter feels friendly enough. One question down, 22 more to go! {0.SimFirstName} has definitely got this.
Even if the girl IS trying to copy, she’ll never admit it. When {0.SimFirstName} accuses her of cheating, those sweet, innocent eyes fill with tears and now everyone thinks {0.SimFirstName} is mean. Rats!
No one ever looks closely at these things, and no one can read {0.SimFirstName}’s mom’s writing anyways. {M0.He}{F0.She} signs it quickly under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and passes it in with a smile.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is busy writing on the board. Shuffling the top paper under {M0.his}{F0.her} shirt, {0.SimFirstName} excuses {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to the bathroom. A few minutes and several word changes later, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s got a pretty convincing copy in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack. Nice!
{0.SimFirstName} waits until the cafeteria monitor is near, then shouts for the mean kid to unhand {M0.his}{F0.her} food. The monitor quickly walks over and simply shushes {0.SimFirstName} AND the mean kid. Is this justice?? It’s almost like the cafeteria monitor doesn’t take her job seriously!
{0.SimFirstName} thinks hard—where would {M0.he}{F0.she} go if {M0.he}{F0.she} were a tiny, fluffy critter often surrounded by screaming children? Sure enough, Fluffy has squeezed himself behind the spooky science jars, hoping the floating specimens will scare off pursuers. Nice try, Fluffy! Never underestimate {0.SimFirstName} when trouble is on the line.
Caught with marker still on his hands, {0.SimFirstName}’s harasser is sent to the principal and worse, home to his furious mom. Unfortunately, being a tattletale is not exactly a boost to {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation. And grade schoolers have looooong memories...
Smart move. {0.SimFirstName} knows not to trust hyper-competitive smart kids. {M0.He}{F0.She} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, blocks out the notebook, and guesses each letter slowly. Correct! {0.SimFirstName} is the surprise winner! 
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher commends {0.SimPronounObjective} for {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and gives {0.SimPronounObjective} a one-time extension. {M0.He}{F0.She} has a lot to get done in a short time, but at least {M0.he}{F0.she} got a second chance!
{0.SimFirstName} knows better than to chew someone else’s gum, especially with all the flu bugs going around. {M0.He}{F0.She} gives it to a classmate instead, who is super happy to have it.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher commends {0.SimPronounObjective} for {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and marks an F next to {M0.his}{F0.her} name. “Next time, you won’t forget,” she smiles. 
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t afraid of what other kids think. {M0.He}{F0.She} and {M0.what’s-his-name}{F0. what’s-her-name} have a lot of fun, at least until the {M0.boy}{F0.girl} calls {M0.him}{F0.her} Stupid. Hey, no fair! Nerds aren’t supposed to be bullies!
{0.SimFirstName} is just shoving the cookie into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth when a loudmouth kid accuses {0.SimPronounObjective} of sneaking food. {0.SimFirstName}’s mouth is way too full to answer. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s only in mild trouble, but sooner or later someone will look for that cookie...
The new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} is alone, since {M0.she}{F0.he} doesn’t have many friends yet. But when {0.SimFirstName} presents the note, the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} misunderstands. “Umm…I don’t even know you.” Worse, the class gossip comes around the corner and spies them together. However bad this feels now, it’ll be much worse soon…
OK, maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have snuck something quieter. {M0.He}{F0.She} only has the wrapper halfway open when the teacher takes {M0.his}{F0.her} SugarBops and sends {0.SimPronounObjective} to the principal, grumbly stomach and all.
{0.SimFirstName} walks over and taps the girl on the shoulder, then whispers into her ear. Blushing, the girl mumbles something and runs off to the girls’ room, one of her friends following. 
{0.SimFirstName} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes trained dutifully on the board, hoping the kid will stop. Instead, the kid fires a ball of paper so hard it rolls up to the teacher’s feet. For once, somebody else gets in trouble, and {0.SimFirstName} gets to look innocent and studious!
{0.SimFirstName} manages to unzip {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack just enough to get a good look at the words. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s almost done with the quiz when Smarty Marty sees and tattles on {0.SimPronounObjective}. Off {0.SimFirstName} goes to the principal, with another big fat F!
Yep, Ballistic Watermelon—yum! {0.SimFirstName} is chewing happily when {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher stops and asks what’s in {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. {0.SimFirstName} isn’t sure which will be worse—cleaning desks at recess or the tummy-ache that’s coming on.
When {0.SimFirstName} is done with {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch, {M0.he}{F0.she} ties a {M0.sweatshirt}{F0.sweater} around {M0.his}{F0.her} waist and goes off to play. {M0.His}{F0.Her} bottom feels clammy and gross, but it’ll dry soon…{M0.he}{F0.she} hopes.
No one ever looks closely at these things, right? {0.SimFirstName} signs it quickly under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and passes it in with a smile. Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she} forgets to sign {M0.his}{F0.her} parent’s name instead of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, and spends the day in the principal’s office instead.
{0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} can do this on {M0.his}{F0.her} own. {M0.He}{F0.She} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, blocks out the notebook, and guesses each letter slowly. Incorrect! The brainiac falls off her chair laughing. Still, better to lose honestly, right?
{0.SimFirstName} dusts off the cookie and places it back in the open bag, but not without checking who owns it. {M0.He}{F0.She} is happy about doing the right thing, but the kid should also know they owe {M0.him}{F0.her} one.
{0.SimFirstName}’s finely honed intelligence isn’t just good for tests. It’s great for outsmarting adults! Sniffling and quivering, {M0.he}{F0.she} shuffles to the front and asks to go see the school nurse. Yes! No test today…just a nice soft cot and the sweet smell of adhesive bandages.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to make a joke out of it—something about alphabets and there’s nothing before the A—but when every kid stays silent, {M0.he}{F0.she} opts for silence, too. One question down, only 22 to go…This is going to be {M0.his}{F0.her} longest class ever.
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t afraid of what other kids think. {M0.He}{F0.She} and {M0.what’s-his-name}{F0.what’s-her-name} have a lot of fun. {M0.He}{F0.She} even offers to help {0.SimFirstName} with homework during free time!
Yes! {0.SimFirstName}’s plane does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing on the substitute’s desk. Unfortunately, the sub is watching closer than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. Crumpling up the plane, he sends {0.SimFirstName} to the principal.
Well, this time at least, being honest pays off. {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher simply calls {M0.his}{F0.her} parents and gets permission. Botanical Gardens, here {M0.he}{F0.she} comes!
{0.SimFirstName} stashes {M0.his}{F0.her} poster in the hall. Sneaking a silver pen from the art supplies {M0.he}{F0.she} covers the poster in shiny swirls and fish during recess. The teacher oohs and aahs over the improved poster, giving {0.SimFirstName} extra stars for the effort!
It’s pretty easy for {0.SimFirstName} to get the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} alone, since {M0.she}{F0.he} doesn’t have many friends yet. And {M0.she}{F0.he} definitely wrote it since {M0.she}{F0.he} blushes from {M0.her bangs}{F0.his head} to {M0.her toes}{F0.his high-tops}. So…now what? {0.SimFirstName} mumbles a sheepish thanks, keeping it a secret for now.
The mean kid swipes {0.SimFirstName}’s brownie, as expected. But today will be different. Yes...today will be different. {0.SimFirstName} idly wonders if the mean kid has ever even heard of the word “laxative.”
{0.SimFirstName}’s stomach growls so loudly that perfect little Susie shushes {M0.him}{F0.her}. The teacher hears and sends them both to the principal’s office, where they have to wait all the way through lunch.
The great thing about stupid people is they never cover their tracks. Spying red marker all over {M0.his}{F0.her} harasser’s hands, {0.SimFirstName} peels off the sign and gives the bully a friendly pat, transferring the sign and the torment.
Pretending to concentrate, {0.SimFirstName} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes and recites the letters from the girl’s notebook. It’s correct! {0.SimFirstName} is the surprise winner! {M0.He}{F0.She} feels a little guilty, but basks in {M0.his}{F0.her} 5 seconds of academic fame.
Poster Improvement
{0.SimFirstName} is super excited to turn in {M0.his}{F0.her} dolphin poster. Illustrations, photos, “Fun Facts,” it has it all! But all the kids are crowding around another kid’s poster, which shimmers with silvery detail. {0.SimFirstName} could say {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent} and then add more stuff at recess…
Exchanging Secret {1.String} Cards
For {1.String}, {0.SimFirstName} decided to handcraft a card for their crush-complete with pipe-cleaner hearts, glitter flowers, and dinosaurs! Because who doesn’t love dinosaurs?!\n\n{0.SimFirstName} just needed to decide if {M0.he}{F0.she} should ‘let it slip’ that it was {M0.him}{F0.her} who made the card or secretly drop it in their cubby.
Honor Roll Bully
Now that {0.SimFirstName}’s on the honor roll, {M0.he}{F0.she} may as well have a sign on {M0.his}{F0.her} back that says, “Kick Me.” Oh wait, {M0.he}{F0.she} does! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} tell the teacher, or try to find the culprit on {M0.his}{F0.her} own?
Spelling Bee Aid
It’s the school Spelling Bee and {0.SimFirstName} has made it to the final round! But this time, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s never even heard of the word {M0.he}{F0.she}’s supposed to spell. Glancing around the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees the class brainiac flash {0.SimPronounObjective} her notebook, with a word written neatly on it. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} accept the help, or give it {M0.his}{F0.her} best guess?
Sick with Worry
It’s test day and {0.SimFirstName} is so nervous, {M0.he}{F0.she} totally blanks! Even copying {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor won’t work because {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor is a D student! What to do…feign illness? Or just take deep breaths?
Pop Quiz
Pop quiz! {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} should have studied {M0.his}{F0.her} spelling list, but it was hard to actually read it under the supercool doodles {M0.he}{F0.she} made. {0.SimFirstName} can just do {M0.his}{F0.her} best, like {M0.his}{F0.her} parents always say, or see if the list is in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack…
Lunchtime Woes
{0.SimFirstName} plops down on the bench for lunch and knows right away that {M0.he}{F0.she} sat in something. Eww! Now everyone’s going to think {M0.he}{F0.she} wet {M0.his}{F0.her} pants. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} make a scene so people know the truth, or just hope that no one notices?
Fluffy's Escape
{0.SimFirstName} volunteers to help the science teacher clean the gerbil’s cage. The teacher has stepped out to talk to a parent, but {M0.he}{F0.she} already knows what to do—{M0.he}{F0.she} opens the cage, dumps the old stuff, and puts fresh stuff in. Fluffy will be so happy with... Uhh … Fluffy?!
Used Gum
{0.SimFirstName} is feeling B-O-R-E-D when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices something squishy stuck to the bottom of {M0.his}{F0.her} desk. Gum? Who put that there? Sneaking a peek, {0.SimFirstName} sees that’s neon green—the exact color of {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite ZumGum flavor.
Finished Early
Wow! {0.SimFirstName} is actually the very first student to finish {M0.his}{F0.her} writing assignment. {M0.He}{F0.She} starts to raise {M0.his}{F0.her} hand to show the teacher, but reconsiders. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can score extra points if {M0.he}{F0.she} draws a picture to go with it?
Payback Scheme
For a week now, a kid has been taking {0.SimFirstName}’s chips, and today he took {M0.his}{F0.her} brownie, too! It’s time for {0.SimFirstName} to take a stand. The way {M0.he}{F0.she} sees it there are two choices in Kid Law: public shaming or private revenge.
Potential Cheater
It isn’t easy earning top grades, and {0.SimFirstName} is feeling the pressure now. It doesn’t help that one of the girls keeps sitting close, glancing her way with her sweet, innocent eyes. Is she trying to be friendly, or just copy off {0.SimFirstName}? What to do?
Musical Volunteering
{0.SimFirstName} is sitting with {M0.his}{F0.her} class in assembly when the music teacher asks for a volunteer. The teacher is looking right at {0.SimPronounObjective}, but {0.SimFirstName} can see how excited the kid next to {0.SimPronounObjective} is to go up on stage. Should {0.SimFirstName} take the chance, or send the other kid?
Airplane Origami
{0.SimFirstName} has mastered the art of the paper airplane, and can’t wait to try {M0.his}{F0.her} original, supersonic design. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} already finished {M0.his}{F0.her} worksheet and the substitute isn’t looking. Maybe now’s a good time?
Principal's Visit
Today, the principal is visiting {0.SimFirstName}’s class! Everyone is to be on their best behavior and not interrupt the lesson. Unfortunately, the kid sitting behind {M0.him}{F0.her} has decided to pelt {M0.him}{F0.her} with…something. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} ignore it or ask the kid to stop?
P.E. Class
{0.SimFirstName}’s P.E. class gets to run laps—lots of them—to build their stamina and lung capacity. {M0.He}{F0.She} is mostly through the first lap when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a gap under the bleachers, just the right size for a little rest. Would Coach notice if {M0.he}{F0.she} sat out a few laps?
Unfinished Assignment
When {0.SimFirstName} gets to class, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes {M0.his}{F0.her} timeline is due, the one {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to start weeks ago. {M0.He}{F0.She} eyes the stack of papers piling up on {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher’s desk. All {M0.he}{F0.she} needs is a few minutes alone with one…Does {M0.he}{F0.she} try to copy a classmate’s, or confess the truth?
The Pink Bib
{0.SimFirstName} is sitting next to a new kid at lunch when {M0.he}{F0.she} spies something pink in his lunchbag. Is that a bib? The kid smiles nervously and claims that he got his baby sister’s lunch again. Then the bib falls out where everyone can see it. Pick it up or just ignore it?
Unsigned Slip
Field trip! {0.SimFirstName} is super excited for a trip to the Botanical Garden—until {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher asks for their permission slips. Whoops. {0.SimFirstName}’s is right there in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack, but it isn’t exactly signed. Forge it, or tell the teacher and risk getting left behind?
Missed Bubble
Another standardized test! {0.SimFirstName} is almost done when {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} skipped a bubble near the top. All {M0.his}{F0.her} answers are one off! {M0.He}{F0.She} starts to tell the teacher but realizes {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} have to take it again. It’s really only for the state—it doesn’t affect {M0.his}{F0.her} grade…
Dropped Cookie
{0.SimFirstName} is putting {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch on the lunch shelf when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that someone’s cookie has fallen out onto the ground. {0.SimFirstName} could return it to the open lunch bag that’s lying on its side, or just take care of the mess by eating the cookie {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.
Nerdy Loner
{0.SimFirstName} is playing alone at recess when a nerdy kid asks if {M0.he}{F0.she} can join in. There’s no real reason {M0.he}{F0.she} couldn’t…except that no one else ever lets {M0.him}{F0.her}. Will {0.SimFirstName} be the first?
Playground Split
{0.SimFirstName} is playing on the slide when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices that an upper grader has split her jeans. The tear is not in a good place, and a bit of pink cotton is showing through. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} let her know?
Turns out the clientele have money for expensive green smoothies AND financing local embezzlement schemes. Win win!
{0.SimFirstName} does it! The company offers {0.SimPronounObjective} the reward--but only if they can publish {M0.his}{F0.her} photo and real name for publicity. Forget it!
Oops. Turns out this &quot;Chonky Dog&quot; is actually the 7th dog to have the role. The Chonky company has a whole kennel full of 'em! There will be no ransom for poor #7.
{0.SimFirstName} won't release information just because {M0.he}{F0.she} can. People could get hurt, and the source of the info was more than a little shady.
{0.SimFirstName} crushes the rival thug. Everyone in both gangs learns a valuable lesson in messing with {M0.him}{F0.her}, and why not to do it.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to start a good old-fashioned street riot, but things escalate quickly. The disturbance gets so big that police swarm to the scene, and the bosses are forced to flee before sealing the deal.
{0.SimFirstName}'s crew were supposed to smuggle out a vertabra or leg bone. Instead they try to waltz out with the Pterodactyl's skull. It doesn't work!
Auditions go well. Everyone learns the sample heist choreography quickly, and a few of the essay-style answers on the written test are quite moving. By the end of the day, {0.SimFirstName} has cast an all-star new ring!
Yeah, tests are fun, but {0.SimFirstName} really shouldn't have asked his man to rappel through a skylight and steal the decorative tiles from City Hall's ceiling. Now that the LT has a broken back, {0.SimFirstName} is down a key player.
Security is very tight around the popular dinosaurs, meaning the Pterodactyl is completely unguarded! {0.SimFirstName}'s crew strolls out with the bone easily.
{0.SimFirstName} posts the spoilers because {M0.he}{F0.she} is a terrible person. The fans are pretty upset. Worse, the author now claims that she won't bother completing the final novel! The Oracle ruined everything!
{0.SimFirstName} pathetically tries to pass off a garbage bag and trash can lid as the height of nouveau fashion. Even the brickhead bouncer sees through {0.SimFirstName}'s disguise and throws {M0.him}{F0.her} out a second time. Into the trash.
After 48 hours of non-stop questioning, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly remembers that the cops hold their annual picnic down at the docks this time of year. Oops! Now the ring doesn't trust {0.SimFirstName} anymore.
How 'bout that? Turns out {0.SimFirstName}'s lieutenant can hijack an armored car—totally solo. Looks like that raise is deserved! And it's offset by the emeralds that were in the armored car.
The manifesto borrows a line from a conspiracy theory website {0.SimFirstName} put up years ago. People are starting to point out the connection! Not good...
{0.SimFirstName} asks for an autograph, like a gushing fan, while begging the bodyguard to snap a photo. Mid-snapshot, {M0.he}{F0.she} snatches the wallet, unseen. Who deserves an acting award now?
{0.SimFirstName} attempts to dislodge the cat from the window by tossing a rock at it. The kitten deftly leaps from the window and lands, claws first, on {0.SimFirstName}'s head. Hopefully the satisfaction of saving a life will help soothe those scratches.
The documents weren't real! They described a possible scenario, not events that actually took place! {0.SimFirstName} put {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation on the line for nothing.
{0.SimFirstName} has the strength advantage, but the thug has technique. {0.SimFirstName} is on the floor before {M0.he}{F0.she} knows what's happening. That's embarrassing!
{0.SimFirstName} overcorrects while spinning the car and it slams into the side of the bridge. One of the pursuing patrol cars misses it by inches! The crew barely manages to escape, but the getaway car is totaled.
Crime is a growth industry, and there just aren't enough qualified thugs to go around right now. And {0.SimFirstName} can't afford to pay relocation fees for out of town crooks. The new ring falls apart before it begins.
{0.SimFirstName} spends the next few hours posting cat memes, attributing famous quotes to the wrong people, and denying responsibility. In the end, no one believes {M0.he}{F0.she} could have accomplished much of anything. Phew!
After {0.SimFirstName} announces to ring members that they'll be interviewed, one by one, in the new &quot;interrogation room&quot; of {M0.his}{F0.her} own design, one of the goons immediately skips town. Snitch identified!
The bosses are pleased that {0.SimFirstName} ignored the obvious provocation. Just because {0.SimFirstName}'s the muscle doesn't mean {M0.he}{F0.she} shouldn't employ a little common sense.
{0.SimFirstName} posts the spoilers, but the ending is so bad no one believes {M0.him}{F0.her}! Now they're accusing The Oracle of writing bad fanfic! Guess that's why writers don't publish their first drafts...
{0.SimFirstName} manages to scrub all trace of {M0.himself}{F0.herself} from the interwebs. Boast? What boast? 
The look on that cook's face was priceless when {0.SimFirstName} burst through the freezer door, running, with fists full of tuna. Gotta appreciate the little moments...
As {0.SimFirstName} launches the getaway car perfectly over the gap in the bridge, {M0.he}{F0.she} regrets not getting that novelty car horn installed to punctuate the moment.
The manifesto is picked up by a major news source and anonymously republished. {0.SimFirstName} stays unrecognized by the mainstream but becomes an underground hero.
{0.SimFirstName} lights a trash can on fire, sets off a car alarm, and tosses a brick through a shop window. ({M0.He's}{F0.She's} a sucker for the classics.) Soon everyone joins the riot outside while the bosses' deal goes down quietly in back.
Knocking over the corner store is a total hit. The cash register has the necessary boost {0.SimFirstName} needed. Plus: free chips!
This is why planning counts. The best {0.SimFirstName} can do at the last second is robbing a food truck using a sock full of rocks. And all {M0.he}{F0.she} gets for the effort is a paltry couple of Simoleons and a really good grilled cheese sandwich with steak and mashed potatoes on it.
Let It Slide
Fight the Thug
{0.SimFirstName} freaks out and tries to settle the debate with a dance battle, which goes exactly as badly as one might think. The scariest part is the thugs who actually try to dance for their side! Nothing is settled.
{0.SimFirstName} leads an all-out brawl in the name of ski masks. They're timeless, and those clown masks are so last year! The gang agrees--or is scared to disagree--that ski masks are the way to go.
A less elegant solution, and really, really noisy, but it works! {0.SimFirstName} pops open the vault door and the crew starts to fill their sacks with Simoleons.
Oh, no! The drill triggered the autolock! There's no way to bust through in time now. {0.SimFirstName} will have to go back to the bosses empty handed.
Wait, didn't {0.SimFirstName} hear a rumor about a new virus called &quot;Triangle?&quot; The one that erases all your files and turns your desktop into a photo of a cat riding a unicorn? The Oracle cannot be fooled.
Give The Kid A Shot
Go One Man Down
{0.SimFirstName} loses the cash {M0.he}{F0.she} had set aside for the new XL-Series brass knuckles, but gains a crook's eternal loyalty. And who can put a price on that?
Whoops. Turns out Joe got caught on purpose -- part of an elaborate plan to bust his brother Stewie out of prison. And {0.SimFirstName} just bailed him out. Maybe now is not the best time to discuss reimbursement?
Ouch. The forum has decided that {0.SimFirstName}'s silence is equal to abject cowardice. {M0.His}{F0.Her} cred is totally damaged. Guess there's no high ground on the internet!
Whatever. {0.SimFirstName}'s hacking skills speak for themselves. So does the username &quot;awesomelf42.&quot;
Quick Fix
Ride It Out
An expert getaway driver always practices speed drills for car repairs. {0.SimFirstName} executes a world record tire change and burns rubber out of there.
Mid-tire change {0.SimFirstName} drops the hubcap and the nuts go flying in all directions. Oh fudge!! {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to get the spare on, but just in time. The rest of the crew is not pleased.
Shut it down. Shut it all down. {0.SimFirstName} can't risk the attention the malfunctioning script would bring. {M0.He}{F0.She} triggers the program's failsafe, causing it to return whatever money was set aside and then destroy itself.
{0.SimFirstName} makes {M0.his}{F0.her} case loudly and passionately online, achieving the same thing as thousands of other people complaining about thousands of other things just as loudly: nothing.
Sneak Back In
Street Fight
Pretend it was a Lie
Shut Down Account
Keep it Quiet
Publish It
Free information for everyone! Now everybody knows why they can light their kitchen faucets on fire.
After riling up all {M0.his}{F0.her} hacker friends for a huge corporate takedown, {0.SimFirstName} can't actually crack their security. Total humiliation.
Don't Feed the Trolls
Hack the Troll's Account
A thug from a rival gang is calling {0.SimFirstName} out, claiming {M0.he}{F0.she} hasn't got what it takes to be hired muscle. Should {0.SimFirstName} teach the thug a lesson or let it slide?
Down a Sim
It's the day before the big heist, and a rival gang pushed Sammy into a vat of cement. His wife is still trying to chip him out. Does {0.SimFirstName} let the super enthusiastic new kid take Sammy's role, or run the heist while down a man?
Flat Tire!
{0.SimFirstName}'s getaway car gets a flat tire at the worst possible time -- during a getaway! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} break out the tire iron for the world's fastest attempted fix or keep driving — on the rims?
Big deal's going down in the back of the club tonight. {0.SimFirstName}'s job is to start a distraction and keep attention off of the bosses. Unfortunately, the jerk bouncer isn't letting {M0.him}{F0.her} in! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} wear a disguise and sneak in, or start a fight in the street instead?
Not boasting about cyber crime is just. So. Hard. But {0.SimFirstName} brags about a hack on social media, and now the authorities may be on to {0.SimPronounObjective}. {M0.He}{F0.She} can delete all trace of {M0.his}{F0.her} social media account—or pretend the boast was a lie.
{0.SimFirstName} has hacked into a laptop owned by of the most popular writers alive! Now The Oracle holds the secrets to the last book in a best-selling series. Should The Oracle publish these spoilers?
Trash Talking
Ugh. Who IS &quot;awesomelf42&quot; anyway? Some trash talker on {0.SimFirstName}'s favorite forum is totally dissing {M0.his}{F0.her} hacking skills. Of course, proving that troll wrong is as simple as hacking into his account. But they say not to feed the trolls.
{0.SimFirstName} cracked the code on this five-star joint's locked freezer. The score? Bluefin tuna, worth mega bucks. One problem: The door shut, locking {0.SimPronounObjective} in! {0.SimFirstName} has got to escape before {M0.he}{F0.she} starts having flashbacks of {M0.his}{F0.her} previous adventures! {0.SimFirstName} can either phone a friend or make a break for it when a cook shows up to work.
Which Mask?
Crisis! Half the crew wants to wear ski masks to the next heist, half insists on clown masks. This thug fashion-off has come to blows. As Ringleader, should {0.SimFirstName} get involved and pick a side—or step aside and stay neutral?
{0.SimFirstName} has been contacted by a member of a government agency with secret docs that could incite a riot if they got out. Does {0.SimFirstName} help release them anonymously, or is it better not to have a riot on {M0.his}{F0.her} hands?
Virus Alert
The anti-virus alert is flashing in the middle of {0.SimFirstName}'s attempt to compose a genius email scam (&quot;I am your twin, a prince. You won the lottery mega bonus!&quot;) Should {M0.he}{F0.she} investigate it — or ignore it and keep serving up spam?
Corporate Misinformation
A corporation is leaking waste into a town's drinking water supply and sitting on coverup docs. {0.SimFirstName} can't wait for the authorities to force information release. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take down the corporation's firewall, or cause negative publicity by complaining on the internet?
Paper Bag
Everyone's trying to make a deal in this park. So that paper bag, stashed behind the trash bin—well, it's probably not full of sandwiches. It could be a setup, though. {0.SimFirstName} can either swipe the bag or leave it alone.
One of {0.SimFirstName}'s lieutenants is demanding a higher percentage of the last stickup. Should {0.SimFirstName} reward his loyalty by giving him a bigger cut? Or make him do something to earn it?
Safe Upgrade
The bank must have upgraded their security. It's taking {0.SimFirstName} way too long to crack this safe. The authorities may be on their way, so {M0.he}{F0.she} has two choices: use the drill, or interrogate the bank manager for codes.
Hefty Guard
{0.SimFirstName} signed up to smash {M0.his}{F0.her} way into the target, but wouldn't you know it — their guard is three times {M0.his}{F0.her} size! {0.SimFirstName} can attempt a surprise attack, or try to sneak by.
Bail Out?
A call came in. Joe, from the local crew, is in the slammer. {0.SimFirstName} can post his bail in the name of loyalty, or save those Simoleons because, well, who told him to go and get pinched?
{0.SimFirstName} has hacked into a credit card company's website. It's tempting to replace the home page with a manifesto about the evils of wasteful spending, but a picture of a hamster with laser eyes could be pretty fun.
Scuffed Shoe
Uh oh. An old woman just scuffed {0.SimFirstName}'s new work shoes, and they are the very finest quality faux-gator. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} teach the old lady a lesson, or just let it slide?
Independently wealthy hipsters are opening a vegan juice bar on {0.SimFirstName}'s turf. {M0.He}{F0.She} could try to scare away potential clientele and force the new bar to close. Then again, maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could run a new racket out of the juice bar?
{0.SimFirstName} failed to get the latest shipment. Turns out the police were already waiting at the docks. There must be a snitch in the ring! Will {0.SimFirstName} grill everyone to find out who tipped off the cops, or fire the whole ring and start a new one?
Triangle?
Deep in the internet, The Oracle surfs alone on waves of digital meaning only {M0.he}{F0.she} can understand. Until {M0.he}{F0.she}'s hit up by an untraceable account. Username: Triangle. Message: &quot;I am real.&quot; Does The Oracle connect with Triangle or ignore this possibly dangerous message?
{0.SimFirstName} is leaving the scene of a mysterious arson (loaded with valuables from the burning building) when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a kitten in the upstairs window. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} spend valuable escape time trying to help the animal or just split before the cops show up?
On the train platform, searching for prime pickpocketing targets, {0.SimFirstName} spots a well-known actress. Looks like that's her bodyguard with her. Is it worth a try to pickpocket her? She might be too high-profile a target.
Fractions &amp; Decimals
{0.SimFirstName} writes a script to siphon money from a major IT company, into {M0.his}{F0.her} account, fractions of cents at a time. Seconds post-launch, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a misplaced decimal point. The script is now stealing full Simoleons. Quick! Attempt a hot fix or shut it down!
With the cops hot on {0.SimFirstName}'s tail, the bridge over the river is closed for repairs! {M0.He's}{F0.She's} going to have to pull a 180 and try to swerve between {M0.his}{F0.her} pursuers! Or is it possible to floor it and jump the bridge..?
Abstract Art
A famous abstract expressionist work is headed to the museum via armored car. Although it's similar to a five-year-old's splatter painting, the work is apparently quite valuable. Should {0.SimFirstName} steal it from the car, or wait and snatch it from the museum?
Being the Brains means making the big calls. Which heist should the crew pull next? They could steal a Pterodactyl bone for an evil scientist hoping to clone an evil dino-army, or they could dognap the star of the Chonky Dog Food commercials and hold him for ransom.
Costume Jewelry
After climbing all those gates and rolling under all those lasers, turns out Mrs. Vanderbilt's jewels were cubic zirconia. And a local boss is shaking {0.SimFirstName} down for an unpaid debt. Is there time to take another impromptu job? Or is it best to do nothing without careful plans?
A well-known software company is offering a huge cash reward to anyone who can crack their security. It's a pretty high profile target. Should {0.SimFirstName} go for it?
That took precious time away from {0.SimFirstName}'s work of spam literary genius, and it turned out to be nothing at all. Now {0.SimFirstName} totally lost {M0.his}{F0.her} train of thought. What was the mega ball payout again?
That took some time away from {0.SimFirstName}'s work of spam literary genius, but it turns out there was a virus. {0.SimFirstName} prevented a total computer (and possibly mental) meltdown.
Call Someone
Wait for Cook
Get Involved

Rummage for Info
{0.SimFirstName} found some juicy information on the Sims that live here. With a little effort, {M0.he}{F0.she} could spin it into a fairly compelling article.

Reminisce
{0.SimFirstName} apologizes for not having the skills to fix the station and sends a message from the rocket to headquarters. It'll be a few days before help arrives, but the astronauts should make it, assuming no one hogs all the blankets.
{0.SimFirstName} blasts off—and just in time, too! An army of spider-like aliens has covered the hillside and fires at {M0.his}{F0.her} retreating ship. Safely in space, {0.SimFirstName} goes to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot…Bingo! {0.SimFirstName}—and the treasure—are on their way home.
With determination, {0.SimFirstName} stabs a finger down onto the button that jettisons all of the trash out of the rocket. Wait, what was {M0.he}{F0.she} supposed to be doing? Oh no!! The government can follow that trail of garbage RIGHT TO {M0.HIM}{F0.HER}!!
{0.SimFirstName} approaches one of the more clear-headed looking crew members and asks what's going on. It turns out that the entire crew has contracted some sort of space-induced madness! {0.SimFirstName} sneaks back to the rocket to contact command. Someone will be up shortly to help the crew.
Eureka! The hat goes on the head! More cheers spew forth from the crowd as {0.SimFirstName} rifles the hat into the stands with a flourish, to be caught by one lucky fan. The hatless pedestal sinks and disappears into the ground, and is shortly replaced again. This latest test pedestal appears to hold a chair: a simple, metal chair.
{0.SimFirstName} squeezes in behind the controls and pilots the little craft down the mountain. And by “pilots,” I mean “rolls.” And by “mountain,” I mean “insanely sharp rocks.” The good news is that a component not unlike a catalyzer lies in the wreckage. The bad news is that {0.SimFirstName} is now clutching a pretty bad gash in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. Night is falling.
Deep in the Evil Cave, {0.SimFirstName} encounters {M0.his}{F0.her} ultimate challenge: Nega-{0.SimFirstName}!! It is the opposite of everything {0.SimFirstName} stands for! Luckily {0.SimFirstName} brought that weapon, so {M0.he}{F0.she} quickly dispatches it and heads for the surface. Now the creature can help you get home!
No two space duels begin the same way, but this alien seems to have a plan. With a wave of his tentacles, he zips off toward the horizon, then turns his starfighter to face {0.SimFirstName}’s. {0.SimFirstName} does the same, pauses, then veers back to charge the alien ship. This duel is on!
The lab is full of geodes and oozing, shimmering specimens. This is some serious science right here. {0.SimFirstName} starts going through the specimen jars when {M0.he}{F0.she} feels a rumbling from the belly of the ship. What was that?!
On {M0.his}{F0.her} way over to the planet, {0.SimFirstName} gets more details from Dispatch. It seems that a colony on Planet Hiattooine’s moon is threatening to revolt and start their own government. Negotiations have broken down, and since neither side will talk to the other, it’s up to {0.SimFirstName} to mend the rift. Who will {M0.he}{F0.she} talk to first?
Grasping the pipe tighter, {0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door and swings wildly. Something small and orange scampers behind a crate. Scanning the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees that a display for a taxidermied alien {M0.he}{F0.she} found is empty! “Don’t hurt me!” a tiny voice cries. Four eyes peek from behind the crate. {0.SimFirstName} lowers the pipe.
{0.SimFirstName} opens throttle around the final bend, dusting Red Tooth and Dog Girl. This is it: time to show the galaxy what {M0.he}{F0.she} is made of. But then over the roar of {M0.his}{F0.her} engines comes a high-pitched whiz as Dog Girl blasts into hyperspeed. Is that legal?! Dog Girl takes first—this time.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to skip the propaganda and get the story from the colonists first. The instant {M0.he}{F0.she} lands on the yellow moon, {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship is surrounded by a mob of angry-looking colonists. Claiming that the planet government is oppressive, they plan on sabotaging the planet’s food replicators to make only non-grilled cheese. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
{0.SimFirstName} should have known that the alien &quot;statue&quot; was too good a bargain. The creature isn’t dead—it’s just a stupid juvenile that was dared by its big brother to pretend. Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy and a free lift home. {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} could get charged with alien-napping, but it’s hard to refuse 4 pleading eyes…
After crossing over via the other ship's airlock, {0.SimFirstName} looks around and realizes that this must have been a science vessel - machines, sparkly rocks, plants, microscopes…yup, definitely science-y stuff. Where should {M0.he}{F0.she} explore next?
What’s the use of thrusters if you never get to use them? {0.SimFirstName} blasts {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters and rockets ahead, leaving Dog Girl, Red Tooth and everyone else in the dust. Nice win! Prize money in hand, {M0.he}{F0.she} hightails it out of there—not that any disgruntled losers could catch {0.SimPronounObjective}.
The voice returns. &quot;Your call is important to us. Would we play this music to you if you were not important to us?&quot; The infuriating music seems to get louder. It has been 0.00003% of one galactic cycle.
{0.SimFirstName} asks the child what planet they're on, but before the child can answer, an army of spider-like aliens appears behind it. Dodging laser fire, {0.SimFirstName} leaps into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship and blasts off. {M0.He}{F0.She} sustains a few hits to {M0.his}{F0.her} landing system, but escapes. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the GPS working again in time to steer home.
The probe is traversing the lunar landscape with agility and style! From {M0.his}{F0.her} tiny porthole, {0.SimFirstName} can see the droid having more fun than {F0.she}{M0.he}'s had in years. Luckily, it should at least bring back a souvenir.
Trying not to panic, {0.SimFirstName} scans the horizon for familiar stars. There! A flashing light. {M0.He}{F0.She} zooms closer only to discover a mysterious glass canister with what looks like a message beacon inside. Extracting it, {0.SimFirstName} finds a map with an X marked on a planet near the constellation’s head. It’s almost too good to be trusted… What now?
{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's robotronic arms to take apart the escape pod. An extra voltrofibrilator and a spare dehexythermomatic gauge will really come in handy someday!
Cruising slowly now, {0.SimFirstName} glides over miles and miles of thick jungle. At last! A clearing. But the clearing seems to be cluttered with alien ruins. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} land there anyway, where there’s less chance of crashing, or opt for the dense, dark cover of the jungle?
Bleep! Bleep! {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship has detected an unexpected object on the horizon. As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} can't believe {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes. Green, billowy treetops. Crystal blue streams. Could it be? The mystical Lush Planet! {0.SimFirstName} switches off {M0.his}{F0.her} turbo boosters as {M0.he}{F0.she} breaks through the planet’s atmosphere.
Passing the planet Yaaaaaaang, {0.SimFirstName} sees a weary-looking alien standing amid a huge pile of trash bags and rusty futon parts. Turns out he's moving to a new pad on the planet Rompiter, and his friend who was supposed to help just bailed! {0.SimFirstName}'s got some extra time - should {M0.he}{F0.she} pitch in?
Nice try, spacesuit! {0.SimFirstName}'s pretty sure {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} be fine without it! Spacesuits are a conspiracy by the fiberglass industry anyway. {M0.He}{F0.She} puts on a nice knitted hat and applies some sunscreen, then heads for the airlock door. But it's locked.
The camp is very busy, and it IS a matter of life or death. {0.SimFirstName} waits for the right chance, then slides the needed part off of a junk pile while the little creature is distracted. Before the theft can be discovered, {M0.he}{F0.she} runs off in the direction of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Time to make repairs and get home quickly!
{0.SimFirstName} sends a message of peace to the creature, who responds by flashing brightly green. It leads {0.SimFirstName} around to a hole in the asteroid, which {F0.she}{M0.he} can see is glowing with beautiful gems. {0.SimFirstName} grabs a few and stores them on {F0.her}{M0.his} ship.
The fighter leads {0.SimFirstName} out of the nebula, but then loops around to get a missile lock on {M0.his}{F0.her} ship! Quickly, {0.SimFirstName} shifts into hyperwarp and escapes. That's when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that the ship automatically picked up some mysterious cargo in the nebula. What could it be?
After wrestling with the strange and slippery creature, {0.SimFirstName} manages to wrangle it into a big specimen jar. {M0.He'll}{F0.She'll} take it back to Earth with {M0.him}{F0.her} for scientists to dissect. Err, &quot;study.&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} wanders through the cloud. The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic—an exquisite dream, or luxurious grave. {M0.He}{F0.She} is at peace with the beauty of {M0.his}{F0.her} lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into clear sky. {0.SimFirstName}'s free! And there before {0.SimPronounObjective} is a strange golden planet.
The creature offers {0.SimFirstName} a special treasure for passing the trials. Then, {0.SimFirstName} watches in amazement as the creature points to the rocket, which seems to lift out of the swamp as if guided by an invisible force! Now {0.SimFirstName} can finally fly home and leave this weird planet far behind {M0.him}{F0.her}!
{0.SimFirstName} thinks {F0.she}{M0.he} has done enough. The satellite probably sends out a better signal. Instead of a million Sims without coverage, it’s only hundreds of thousands. That’s a win on some level, right?
{0.SimFirstName} is on {M0.his}{F0.her} way home to deliver the prized pooch and collect {M0.his}{F0.her} reward! The animal under the desk had been Fitz all right, dyed brown in a lame attempt at disguise. But wait—there’s a fighter closing in. Then {0.SimFirstName} realizes: the injection was a tracker. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can outmaneuver them.
{0.SimFirstName} knows better. Battling the black hole’s pull, {M0.he}{F0.she} guides {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket alongside the alien’s and persuades him to abandon ship. The pilot is barely clear when his ship is sucked into oblivion, but he doesn't look too grateful. Giving {0.SimFirstName} a (very) little something for the help, he asks to be dropped at the next planet.
{0.SimFirstName} finally connects with Tech Support. A pre-recorded voice says, &quot;Hello. What can I help you with? You can say, 'ship repairs' or 'space madness.'&quot;
Phew! {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship lands without a scratch and so far, no aliens are running out to greet {M0.him}{F0.her}. {0.SimFirstName} wanders into a half-collapsed temple, which seems to have been constructed of massive, porous rock. More strange space rocks are scattered about, along with a beautiful sacrificial bowl and other religious artifacts. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} bring an artifact home for analysis?
{0.SimFirstName} wanders through the cloud. The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic—an exquisite dream, or luxurious grave. {M0.He}{F0.She} is at peace with the beauty of {M0.his}{F0.her} lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into clear sky. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} free! All {M0.he}{F0.she} needs is a little more luck: {M0.he's}{F0.she's} got to get home on fumes.
{0.SimFirstName} parks {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship and goes into the pound. The alien at the front desk raises an eye as {M0.he}{F0.she} walks in. “Job's filled,” she says. {0.SimFirstName} can explain about the missing dog… or make an excuse to look around.
{0.SimFirstName} is tired. So tired in fact, {M0.he}{F0.she} could fall asleep right here on the 69th floor, if weren't for all the howling. The animals in here are nothing like “Fitzy-Poo.” Finding a stairwell, {M0.he}{F0.she} heads back to the front desk. The alien is gone, but what's that {0.SimFirstName} hears? Whimpering from under the desk...?
Being the supreme deity for an entire civilization seems like a lot of work, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn't think {M0.he's}{F0.she's} up for it. Let someone else deal with the responsibility. {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship and heads for home.
Without light, the aliens can't grow anything or do anything…but neither can {0.SimFirstName}. Sitting in a public restroom in the dark isn't exactly thrilling, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to head for home, having learned exactly nothing about the effects of absolute power.
{0.SimFirstName}'s generosity has allowed the aliens to grow complacent and spoiled. {M0.He}{F0.She} really didn't want this responsibility in the first place, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to get out while {M0.he}{F0.she} still can. As {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves, {M0.he}{F0.she} hears the panicked cries of the aliens, calling out for food, clothing, and medicine. {0.SimFirstName} hopes they'll be okay...
{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's robotronic arms to drag the escape pod on board through the airlock. After a few minutes of banging on the hatch, it pops open - and an alien creature pops out! {0.SimFirstName}'s not sure whether {M0.he}{F0.she} should try to catch it and subdue it, or just shove it out into space.
Avoid the (Hypothetical) Booby Traps
The results show that this ship once belonged to the Boronians, creatures of pure Boron. This is useful scientific data, as very little is known of creatures of the fifth element. Scans continue now that the results have been seen, and the rocket backs out of the wreck. What happened just before?
Even in space, nature calls. {0.SimFirstName} docks with a starside rest station. It's pretty nasty in there…but then {0.SimFirstName} looks closely at the top of the toilet and discovers that it's inhabited by a teensy tiny alien civilization!
With {0.SimFirstName}’s help, the colonists quickly access Hiattooine’s food replicators. Not only are they making non-grilled cheese, but they’re making them 1,000 times faster than before! Buried under an avalanche of inedible sandwiches, the government surrenders, agreeing to reopen talks if the colonists undo their handiwork. A victorious {0.SimFirstName} flies home, reward in hand.
{0.SimFirstName} puts a paltry few boxes in the back of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. One box is smoking, and another's making a whimpering sound, but {0.SimFirstName} doesn't ask questions. {M0.He}{F0.She} delivers it on time and makes a few extra bucks.
While passing the asteroid belt, {0.SimFirstName} notices something ducking behind a nearby rock. {0.SimFirstName} slowly guides {M0.his}{F0.her} ship in to investigate.
Correct! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} zooms through the cosmos, arriving at a debris field. What should {F0.she}{M0.he} do?!
{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the seemingly undamaged station, but hears some odd laughter echoing down the halls. {M0.He}{F0.She} follows the strange sounds to the mess hall, where some clearly deranged astronauts are throwing bricks of freeze-dried ice cream at each other. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
Hey! Turns out government-sanctioned bullying can be rather fun! Hovering over the yellow moon, {0.SimFirstName} blasts the volume on {M0.his}{F0.her} comm and demands to talk to the Rebel leader. A balding man in flowing robes emerges from a small hut and gazes up at {0.SimFirstName} fearfully.
Why not? That should get the government off {0.SimFirstName}'s back! Maybe this hot plate will do the trick? No...no, that just causes pain. Lots and lots of pain. What can {M0.he}{F0.she} do to deal with it?
Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} gives a vicious war cry, and a high-speed dogfight follows! {0.SimFirstName} emerges the fearless victor. Avoiding the time-edge this time around, {F0.she}{M0.he} can return home safely.
Really? Are you sure you--I mean, {0.SimFirstName} should erase all the data on yo--{M0.HIS}{F0.HER} computer? All data will be permanently deleted. Proceed?
{M0.He}{F0.She} unseals the air tank and peeks inside - there's nothing in it! Nothing at all! Suspicious! {M0.He}{F0.She} puts it in the air lock and jets it into space. A few minutes later {M0.he}{F0.she} sees an empty air tank float by {M0.his}{F0.her} window. How did that get there? Is someone following {0.SimPronounObjective}? Is that rogue tank a listening device?
{0.SimFirstName} gently and lovingly sprinkles water on the crop fields. The plants start growing strong and the aliens rejoice! Now they want more sunshine.
Someone picks up {0.SimFirstName}’s distress call and claims to be nearby. In minutes, a large, rundown-looking fighter emerges from the nebula’s glow. “Follow us, {M0.Bucko}{F0.Buttercup}!” a low, reptilian voice says over the comm. Does {0.SimFirstName} follow?
{0.SimFirstName} can't let the government see {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo, because then THEY'LL KNOW. But after jettisoning all the cargo, the ship is still too heavy! The only thing left is fuel and food, so {0.SimFirstName} starts eating all the astronaut food {M0.he}{F0.she} can.
{0.SimFirstName} gives them more food, more sunlight, and even starts giving some of the aliens rides from one end of the colony to another. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} basically become their slave, all just to get them to like {M0.him}{F0.her}. While they're sleeping, {0.SimFirstName} sneaks away to go home and meditate on the nature of co-dependency.
{M0.He}{F0.She} dismantles every non-essential part of the ship for extra sheet metal to cover the breach, but {0.SimFirstName} has seen better patches on pants. {0.SimFirstName}'s not even positive it will make re-entry into atmosphere! {M0.He}{F0.She} straps in for a bumpy landing.
{0.SimFirstName} pulls the toilet over to a sunnier part of the rest stop. Now the aliens have everything they could ever need. &quot;Our deity is so generous,&quot; cry the aliens. But now they're a little spoiled, and they start asking {0.SimFirstName} to smite their enemies.
Juvenile or not, {0.SimFirstName} knows it’s best not to cross a frightened alien. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} almost back to the Flea Market when the creature shows itself. It is a juvenile, whose big brother dared it to board {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy before arriving home. It will take off {0.SimFirstName}’s handcuffs if {M0.he}{F0.she} agrees....
Hoping {M0.his}{F0.her} allergies stay under control, {0.SimFirstName} lunges into the hissing mob and gropes about wildly. Pain shoots up {M0.his}{F0.her} arm as {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers close around a wriggling, velvety beast. Success! {M0.He}{F0.She} wrangles the animal into the ship and thrusts it into a iron cage. {0.SimFirstName} can’t wait to see what they’ll make of this back home…
Hmm, this is a little disturbing. {0.SimFirstName} thought that would help. The next symptom of Space Madness is paranoia and bad decision-making. Why didn't the fresh air tank help? It must have been a conspiracy!! {0.SimFirstName} needs to deal with this right now.

Slowly and deliberately, {0.SimFirstName} wrapped scrumptious slices of bacon around all sorts of objects in the workplace. However, vermin and insects claimed the savory strips and ran amuck through the office! Co-workers were aghast and productivity reached an all-time low.
While {0.SimFirstName} carefully stacked several of full cups of water in front of {M0.his}{F0.her} classroom, a teacher arrived during the mischievous act! {0.SimFirstName} was scolded severely for this inappropriate behavior. \n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s school performance has decreased.
In an extraordinary display of determination, {0.SimFirstName} meticulously stacked hundreds of full cups of water in front of {M0.his}{F0.her} classroom, plus a few others for good measure. Unfortunately, the pyramid collapsed before class started, resulting in a lot of wasted effort and a pathetic pile of empty cups.
In an extraordinary display of determination, {0.SimFirstName} meticulously stacked hundreds of full cups of water in front of {M0.his}{F0.her} classroom, plus a few others for good measure. Teachers were forced to slowly dismantle the aqueous pyramid, offering laughs and some free time for all the students. The culprit was never identified.\n \n{0.SimFirstName} has earned the following:\n·School Performance Boost\n·Increased Creative Skill
{0.SimFirstName} was caught red-handed by a teacher with a cage full of gerbils, and there was no way to talk {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of it.\n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s school performance has decreased, and {M0.he}{F0.she} has received extra homework for the next week as punishment.
In the beginning, there were no gerbils. When {0.SimFirstName} entered the classroom, that was no more. Hundreds of little furry creatures rampaged through the halls, bringing delight to most and terror to some. It was a fully successful prank! \n \n{0.SimFirstName} has increased {F0.her}{M0.his} Creative skill.
{0.SimFirstName} worked up the school geeks into a frenzy, and they collectively attacked the jocks and stuffed them into lockers. Finally, the tables have been turned!\n \n{0.SimFirstName} has earned 25 Simoleons.
{0.SimFirstName} tried to convince the geeks to rise up against the jocks, but the jocks overheard {0.SimPronounObjective}, and wrecked {F0.her}{M0.his} plans. Now {F0.she}{M0.he} is the one stuffed into a locker! \n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s school performance has decreased.
Well that was embarrassing! {0.SimFirstName} tried to stuff the spectacled geeks into the locker, but {F0.she}{M0.he} slipped on a 20-sided die and the geeks got away!
{0.SimFirstName} cleverly set up a trail of 20-sided dice that led directly to an open locker. The geeks fell for the trap, and {0.SimFirstName} slammed the spindly armed geeks inside the locker!&#xD;&#xA;
Sticky Clay In The Mic
{0.SimFirstName} stealthily packed the mic with Sticky Clay after {F0.her}{M0.his} set. When {0.SimFirstName}'s Co-worker performed their set, no one in the audience could understand a word they said.

What a disaster! {0.SimFirstName}'s Co-worker found the Sticky Clay prior to their performance, and totally ruined the prank.
Secretly, {0.SimFirstName} passed out all the answers to the multiple choice test, charging just a few Simoleons per cheat sheet. Of course, these answers were totally fabricated and helped {0.SimFirstName} beat the curve on the exam! \n \n{0.SimFirstName} has earned the following:\n·School Performance Boost.\n·Bonus of 300 Simoleons.
Unfortunately, no students could be convinced that the test answers were real. Left with an empty stack of papers, {0.SimFirstName} tried to hide the prank material but was caught by a teacher in the process. \n \n{0.SimFirstName} has been given extra homework as punishment for this prank.
Re-Arrange Keys On The Keyboard
{0.SimFirstName} confounded {F0.her}{M0.his} Co-worker by switching the 'T' and the 'V' on their keyboard, and {0.SimFirstName} was able to get ahead of the competition at work.\n \n{0.SimFirstName} has earned the following:\n·Work Performance Increase.\n·Increased Mischief Skill.
When {0.SimFirstName} was in the middle of switching the 'O' and the 'P' keys, {F0.her}{M0.his} boss caught {0.SimPronounObjective} in the act.\n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s work performance has decreased.
Mustaches For Art
Just as {0.SimFirstName} was putting the final strokes on the last handlebar mustache, {F0.her}{M0.his} boss caught {0.SimPronounObjective} in the act of defacement!\n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s job performance has decreased.
{0.SimFirstName}'s painting defacement went off without a hitch, and now all the portraits are sporting snazzy 'staches.\n \n{0.SimFirstName} has earned the following:\n·Work Performance Boost.\n·Increased Mischief Skill.
Make All Invisible Ink Visible
Chaos ensued in {0.SimFirstName}'s office today as {F0.her}{M0.his} Co-workers scrambled to hide their now-visible messages. Once they realized it was just a prank, everyone broke out in giggles! \n \n{0.SimFirstName} has increased {F0.her}{M0.his} Mischief skill.

Unfortunately, the email was password protected, and {0.SimFirstName} was unable to hack in. 
Oops! While {0.SimFirstName} was hacking into {F0.her}{M0.his} Co-worker's email, {0.SimFirstName} forget to cover {F0.her}{M0.his} tracks. IT traced the hack and reported {0.SimFirstName} to {F0.her}{M0.his} boss.\n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s job performance has decreased!
Free The Frogs
{0.SimFirstName}'s plan to free the frogs didn't go quite as planned. {F0.Her}{M0.His} boss is furious that dinner was ruined, and everyone has frog goo in their hair! \n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s job performance has decreased massively!
{0.SimFirstName} threw open the doors to the frog's cages, and they gratefully hopped into the waiting arms of the humane society workers. {F0.Her}{M0.His} Co-workers were overjoyed to see the frogs escape with their legs intact.\n \n{0.SimFirstName} has earned the following: \n·Increased Mischief Skill\n·Work Performance Boost

Fake Alien Contact
{0.SimFirstName}'s Co-workers were not fooled for even a second by {F0.her}{M0.his} prank. {F0.She}{M0.He} should remember not to use such an obvious alien puppet next time.\n \n{0.SimFirstName}'s work performance has decreased!
{0.SimFirstName} made a video of an alien puppet saying &quot;We come in peace,&quot; and {F0.her}{M0.his} Co-workers totally bought it! They went into a frenzy preparing a welcoming party and cake for the fake aliens.\n \n{0.SimFirstName} has increased {F0.her}{M0.his} Mischief skill.

Royal Crabtree Tea Set
Princess Cordelia adored crabs almost as much as she adored tea. Nothing was more delightful than seeing them dart about the tide pools in mortal fear of gulls! The Princess designed this tea set to capture the crab’s alacrity. She was working on a version that actually scuttled off, but the plans blew away while she was sipping tea.
Captain Chaz MacFreeling’s Galleon
Princess Cordelia’s 2nd pirate boyfriend, Captain Chaz MacFreeling, was as vain about his galleon as he was about his looks.

This is a replica of the replica, rebuilt in astonishing detail by contemporary artisans.
Sea Captain’s Clock
It’s easy to lose track of time on a submersible, so Princess Cordelia designed this clock to create some order in her days. Unfortunately, it was still impossible to tell day from night, so she gave up and fed it to a kraken. Today, land-dwelling collectors find it much more useful.

Ode to Jazz 5: “Ivory”
Princess Cordelia loved piano most of all. Though she had cut her jazz band adrift during her escape from her kingdom, she continued to ache for their music, and so found herself painting instruments. The piano keys in this tribute seem to arch up toward the light, almost as if lifted by the current. Apt, isn’t it?
Blue for the Blues Wall Painting  
When Princess Cordelia was forced to flee her kingdom, she simply couldn’t fit her beloved musicians on the submersible. This colorful portrait is a tribute to her bass player Martin Maxwell, and somehow made her feel less blue.
Cool Serenade
Rendered in temperate painterly hues, a cool jazz trumpeter plays a sophisticated tune.
Tenor Mood
The silhouette of a saxophonist stands tall in this jazzy piece of art.
Ode to Jazz 4: “Feeling Blue”
When The Great Sloth Invasion forced Princess Cordelia to flee, she simply couldn’t fit everyone on her submersible. But firing her beloved jazz band remained a regret so sharp, she painted a series of pictures to honor them. This wistful silhouette portrays one of her musicians still playing blues in the deep blue (purplish) sea. 
Ode to Jazz 3: “Sea Bass”
Even a submersible as grand as the Eppsilon has its limitations. Princess Cordelia had to cast out many employees, including her beloved jazz band. She longed for their music so deeply that she painted a series of pictures as a tribute. This silhouette portrays bass player Martin Maxwell still playing in the depths of the sea. So poignant! 
Ode to Jazz 2: “Goldentips”
When Princess Cordelia was forced to flee her kingdom, she had to leave her beloved jazz band behind. This wistful silhouette portrays the sax legend Jacob Goldentips still playing in the depths of the sea, which was how the Princess liked to imagine him.
Ode to Jazz 1: “Golden”
One thing Princess Cordelia simply couldn’t fit on her submersible was her beloved jazz band. She so missed the music of her former life that she painted a series of pictures to commemorate it. This lively number was inspired by the sax legend Jacob Goldentips, who was left tragically adrift during The Great Sloth Invasion.

Superasymmetry

The Amour-propre
Reclamation Homeware truly understands art. Art is simply defined as man’s last hope to crawl out from the shadows of fact and expose himself to the piercing light of infinity. It challenges us to climb mental ladders and dive into unknown expanses of self. Plus, ours is made of garbage!
The Recondite
Proof is a prison from which curiosity languishes and dies, its limp arm dangling between the bars of its cell where it once stretched toward the light of freedom. Art is the key that unlocks the cell door and liberates our captive minds, daring them to run as fast as they can.

Too often we force ourselves to label what we see, what we hear, taste and touch. Here is a painting. Is it a good painting? Before you apply that label, consider that definition destroys exploration, allows us to sit back and dust off our hands and say “all done.” Art is never done being art!

Long John Buttercups Wall Sconce
Whenever Princess Cordelia's Submarine dove or rose, she enjoyed watching the lights briefly flicker. This particular lamp was named after Princess Cordelia's first pirate boyfriend, Captain Long John Buttercups. He always said this sconce reminded him of his old galleon.
Old Life Gas Lamp
When Princess Cordelia designed this lamp, she was feeling nostalgic for the land she left behind. While sitting in the workshop on her submersible, the Eppsilon, she thought of the dimly-lit gas lights that lined the streets and the silhouettes of women in long dresses and men in top hats walking by. Sigh.
Sea Glass Wall Sconce
The glass of this wall sconce was once clear and crisp. A special machine on the Lady Cordelia’s Submarine processes the glass and gives it this opaque, soft feel. The machine blasts the glass with sand, salt, and steam which weathers this sconce in the same way as natural sea glass.
Cast Iron Flood Light
It can get dark under the sea, particularly when pirates keep toppling into your lamps. This cast iron wall sconce is nearly indestructible, especially when mounted above hat-level. It casts a light so intense that Princess Cordelia’s 2nd pirate boyfriend was known to use it for tanning, until she dumped him for being so vain.
Anemone Wall Sconce
Princess Cordelia was known to lounge by a tide pool for hours, just watching the fragile beauty entrapped within. One of her favorite creatures was the anemone, its petal-like tentacles waving innocently as it waited to ensnare its lunch. With subtle curls and an organic, unassuming form, this elegant wall sconce was created in the anemone’s honor.
Tunicate Wall Sconce
If you can't live under the sea like Princess Cordelia, bring the ocean life to you! The Tunicate Wall Sconce is modeled after one of the most beautiful types of sea sponges. It was Princess Cordelia's favorite sconce. She often parked her submarine outside a reef and just soaked in the sea life, metaphorically.

Sea stars occasionally stuck themselves to the portholes of the submersible, rather annoyingly blocking the light, not to mention the view. Determined not to let her irritation get the better of her, Princess Cordelia created a lamp that is a glorious tribute to the sea star-with squat, pointy legs that can actually regenerate when harmed.
Scallop Table Lamp
Princess Cordelia tried scallops for the first time while aboard her submarine. Cooked in garlic, they were the most delicious thing she had ever eaten. She was thankful for the experience and in honor of the poor scallop that lost its life, she designed this lamp. So touching!
Jellyfish Bell Table Lamp
While her submarine was docked, Princess Cordelia enjoyed some fresh air on the deck. Looking down she saw the glow of millions of jelly fish. It was breathtaking. Inspired by that moment, she designed this lamp and brought the shape and glow of the jellyfish bell to you. Aren't you glad she didn't include tentacles?
Angling for Light Mission-style Lamp
The remarkable quality of this lamp’s craftsmanship shines through every slatted angle and casts your incredible taste onto every wall of the room. Illuminate your brilliance, only with the Angling for Light.
3 Senses Oil Lamp
Light bulbs are good for a lot of things, but they haven’t come close to replicating the rich, golden ambiance of a true antique oil lamp, until now. Handcrafted in the artisan tradition, this electric-powered lamp casts the same flickering lamplight, warmth and even smell of yesteryear’s kerosene companions. Battery compartment is concealed in the base for a cord-free effect.
Mega Table Lamp
Thanks to the mass-produced antiques from MegaMission Furniture Warehouse, you can own a handsome, mission-style table lamp that’s exactly as unique as everyone else’s! Each scuff mark and rough edge was carefully placed according to our proprietary imperfection algorithm for maximum quaintness. How charming!
Okuta Lamp with Woven Shade
A solid, hefty base and a colorful, textured shade never goes wrong in any home. With neutral tones and patterns inspired by fabric artisans of West Africa, add ambience and style to any space with the Okuta table lamp! Its warm glow creates a cozy atmosphere, perfect for relaxation and gatherings alike.

Cute Critter Light
What's better than a cute animal? A helpful cute animal! Always have a little friend on your side during those late night diaper changes with this adorable lamp. Your kids will love it too.
A Story of Three Candles
Three candles who stand still, save their flickering lights, sought refuge from the impending night. Said one to three, the tallest was he, excuse me please, but I don’t see why we should fear the night, we shine, we glow, we light up so bright. Said three to one, the smallest of thee, it is true we shine so bright, but my wicks height is low, and soon, out of sight.
Four Festive Candles, ho, ho, ho!
Chandlers have long sought the elusive fourth candle display. Three is a magic number, its placement always perfect, but four… the placement never feels right, the function never flows properly, the je ne sais quoi was always off. But now, beauty has frozen in time, form and function have come together as one! “Four Festive Candles, ho, ho, ho,” is testament to that journey, that perfection CAN be found, even in the elusive “four.”
Bright Idea Robot Lamp
Imagine, if robots could actually think, what bright ideas they’d have! This playful little bot is a glowing addition to any tot’s desk or nightstand. Simply flip the switch for a brilliant idea that lights up the room.
Kid's Soccer Ball Light
Is better lighting a GOAL in your kids’ room? Give it a real KICK with this sporty table light! (It’s a soccer ball.)
Kid's Table Light
Worried about the “tone” in your kids’ room? Lighten up with this lovely table light!

{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the art dealer's tasks on time, which immediately fractured their business relationship. The dealer accused {0.SimFirstName} of being an undercover cop, and the situation quickly deteriorated from there. At this point, it's best to just walk away...
{0.SimFirstName} felt somewhat stressed during his work for the client; {M0.he}{F0.she} had the distinct impression that {M0.he}{F0.she} was being surveilled... Oh well, the job is done now, and {0.SimFirstName} received {M0.his}{F0.her} expected payment. Just act normal, and everything should be fine.
The client greatly appreciated {0.SimFirstName}'s 'professionalism' in completing the job without attracting undue interest. {0.SimFirstName} isn't the type to ask questions either; {M0.he's}{F0.she's} just happy to have the forgery gone, and some extra cash in {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket.
{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete the full job on time, and the client didn't seem like the type to handle disappointment well. {M0.He}{F0.She} still received a portion of the job's payment... Presumably the money was to assure {M0.his}{F0.her} continued silence. Hopefully if {M0.he}{F0.she} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} head down, any lingering tension will blow over.
Hitting all the right notes, the client is happy with {0.SimName}'s work. The right mix of high fantasy, drama, and just the right amount of fairy-presence.
{0.SimName} and the client are working their magic, crafting and weaving a fantastic new book series. They were incredibly pleased!
{0.SimName} really should have followed the client's notes more closely. After being told there weren't nearly enough fairies, they both agreed not to work together further. 
The editors enjoyed {0.SimName}'s work and gave excellent feedback on where the next chapters could go. With the experience gained from writing for this series, {F0.she}{M0.he} could really see their career spread its wings and take flight. 
They loved {0.SimName}'s work! Their feedback included praises for bringing back fan favorite characters, adding a new twist to old plot lines, and introducing a wholly new, interesting threat to be explored in later books. 
The company thanks {0.SimName} for their work, but feels the plot is too contrived and breaks fan expectations too strongly. They will let {F0.her}{M0.him} know if they want to work together in the future, but this wasn't the right project.
{0.SimFirstName}'s sci-fi landscapes are spot on for what the film's director had in mind. The director let {M0.him}{F0.her} know that {M0.she'd}{F0.he'd} be happy to enlist {0.SimFirstName}'s talents again in the future.
The film's producers are over the moon for the sci-fi landscapes that {0.SimFirstName} envisioned. They not only paid {0.SimPronounObjective} a bonus for {M0.his}{F0.her} swift work, they also promised to insert a small Easter egg in {M0.his}{F0.her} image into the environment in tribute to his contribution!
The sci-fi film's production has been delayed, because {0.SimFirstName} only completed a portion of the goals that {M0.he}{F0.she} was asked to complete. Union rules still mandated that {M0.he}{F0.she} get paid for the portion of work that {M0.he}{F0.she} did complete though.
The dev team was pleased to receive {0.SimFirstName}'s environment concepts, but they still refused to tell {0.SimPronounObjective} the name of the game that {M0.his}{F0.her} work would be used within. {M0.He}{F0.She}'ll just have to stay tuned to see what the team announces!
The studio's art director can't believe the quality of the work that {0.SimFirstName} submitted, and it was all completed so quickly as well! {M0.She}{F0.He} expressed how much {M0.she}{F0.he} wished that {M0.she}{F0.he} could offer {0.SimFirstName} a full time gig, but the studio unfortunately didn't have any headcount available to allow {M0.her}{F0.him} to do so. {M0.She}{F0.He} was able to procure a nice bonus on top of the gig's agreed upon payment though, and {0.SimFirstName} won't say no to that!
The dev team is frustrated that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete the entirety of {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks by the set milestone, causing the studio to miss an important deadline with their publisher. {0.SimFirstName} was lucky to still receive a partial payment for the portion of the work that {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to finish.
{0.SimFirstName}'s environment concepts arrived just in the nick of time, allowing the team's environment artists to have enough time to create something to show in the game's next kick started campaign update.
The indie studio is incredibly relieved to not only receive such high quality environment concepts from {0.SimFirstName}, but to receive them so swiftly! Their environment artists are starting immediately on turning {M0.his}{F0.her} concepts into fully featured backdrops within the studio's upcoming title. As a thanks, they've funneled some extra kick started cash away from backer rewards and into {0.SimFirstName}'s pocket.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the entirety of {M0.his}{F0.her} goals in time, and the indie studio had to apologize to their project's backers for not having anything to show in their campaign update. They attempted to deflect some of the blame to {0.SimFirstName}, but their fans weren't having it.
{0.SimFirstName} completed the job on time, but had to wait for the paranoid client to double check all the files before receiving the payment. Sometimes there are a few weird ones, but {F0.she}{M0.he} figures it's fine as long as the money is paid.
The client became suspicious at how fast {0.SimFirstName} finished the job. It took a bit of convincing, but when the shifty individual finally turned around, they gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a nice bonus. 
&quot;What do you mean you didn't finish? You're one of them aren't you?! I should've known!&quot;\n\n{0.SimFirstName} doesn't know what happened after that, but was pleasantly surprised when {F0.she}{M0.he} still received a bit of pay.
The small business owner still doesn't really know what happened, but accepted the job as done. {F0.She}{M0.He} reported that the clients seemed happy with the results, so {F0.she}{M0.he} doesn't care.
The small business owner had no idea what was what, but accepted the job as done. Given the early delivery, {F0.she}{M0.he} even gave {0.SimFirstName} a little bonus on top!
Well, it seems {0.SimFirstName} doesn't know encryption either. Either that, or {F0.she}{M0.he} underestimated the amount of work. Either way, the small business owner was pretty upset. It's a good thing they don't seem to know how to file a formal complaint, so {0.SimFirstName} still received a portion of the pay.
The client was obviously relieved when the encrypted files were delivered on time. Not one to wait for an emotional breakdown, {0.SimFirstName} quickly accepted the pay and broke contact.
The client was shocked when the job was done ahead of schedule. Immensely grateful, {F0.she}{M0.he} thanked {0.SimFirstName} with a little bonus!
{0.SimFirstName} failed to encrypt all of the files in time. This seemed to be the last straw for the client, who completely broke down. They said something about &quot;not paying the full amount&quot; before passing out. Not a great job, but at least a little money was earned.
The client accepted the encrypted files and pestered {0.SimFirstName} about whether {F0.she}{M0.he} made copies and are hiding them somewhere. It took a while, but {F0.she}{M0.he} managed to convince them that {F0.she}{M0.he} did not.
The client was very impressed at how fast {0.SimFirstName} was able to deliver the encrypted files. The individual, who tried their best to remain as mysterious as possible, paid a bit extra to show their appreciation.
&quot;You better not be using my data for nefarious purposes...&quot;\n\nIt seems trust isn't the only thing that {0.SimFirstName} lost when {F0.she}{M0.he} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} also lost most of the pay. A little is better than none at all, at least.
The studio clearly underestimated the amount of work that goes into even making text-based games. Still, {0.SimFirstName} finished the project on time, and even enjoyed {F0.herself}{M0.himself} along the way.
The art was so gorgeous, even {0.SimFirstName} was starting to fall in love. {F0.She}{M0.He} ended up so driven to complete the game, that {F0.she}{M0.he} finished it ahead of schedule. The art studio loved that; they promised to work with {F0.her}{M0.him} again soon, and gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a lofty bonus.
The deadline arrived, and nobody is happy. At least all of the concept art and assets can be salvaged for other projects. Based on this alone, the art studio still gave a small amount of pay to {0.SimFirstName} for the time spent.
Either the mechanics were too complex, or the design wasn't clear enough. {0.SimFirstName} was able to finish on time, but the game just isn't fun. It's not {F0.her}{M0.his} business to tell the client that, though. Just take the paycheck and move on!
The gimmicky mechanics were actually very simple to make. Delivering the game ahead of schedule netted {0.SimFirstName} some extra pay, which is great because the game is not original at all and will probably not do very well. Oh well!
{0.SimFirstName} tried to explain that there was no way to work the weird mechanics into the level design, but the client wasn't having it. They claimed that {F0.she}{M0.he} just didn't understand, but it's not {F0.her}{M0.his} fault -- the design is just too ahead of their time.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} was still paid, at least. It's a fraction of the contract pay, but it's something.
It was tough, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to finish on time. Despite the initial impressions, the pay was good too. The game itself is a problem, though, and {0.SimFirstName} is not expecting great reviews...
The game was actually almost done. It turns out the real reason that developers were leaving the project was because of how demanding the game's creative director is. That wasn't a problem for {0.SimFirstName} though. Freelancers are used to picky and rude clients! Apologetic, the producer made sure that a little extra was added to the final payment!
&quot;Not you too? Does everyone want us to fail?&quot;\n\nTrue to their word, the crowd-funded company did pay {0.SimFirstName} whatever they had left. Unfortunately, without a game to ship and running out of time, what they had was not much at all.
It's a fun game with friends for sure. The company was pleased with the end product and invited {0.SimFirstName} to play it with them. Unfortunately, {F0.she}{M0.he} couldn't keep up with the banter and felt a bit left out.
The company actually had a few games they had planned to release at the same time. Due to how quickly {0.SimFirstName} was able to deliver {F0.her}{M0.his} project, it was placed at the top of the list. The party company gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a party bonus!
The client was obviously upset, but it was also the most entertaining phone call {0.SimFirstName} has had in a while. Couple that with still being paid a bit of money for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, and {0.SimFirstName} is left with a very confusing feeling.
The deadline was a bit too tight to polish the game enough for the immersion to shine through. Still, the job was done and {0.SimFirstName} was paid.
The game actually brought a tear to {0.SimFirstName}'s eye. Driven to finish it so {F0.she}{M0.he} could play it {F0.herself}{M0.himself}, {F0.she}{M0.he} ended up delivering way ahead of schedule. This was well appreciated by the game director, and {0.SimFirstName} was paid extra!
{0.SimFirstName} received an earful about &quot;not being motivated enough&quot; and &quot;failing to see the vision&quot;. It was upsetting, but at least the client still transferred a portion of the expected pay.
“The silly natural of your writing as left many in our clownish workspace entertained. Witty and Wacky Inc. thanks you for providing more than the traditional double entendre and simple quip or quote.” Well it seems like the client was happy, but why was their message a video of a man in military garb?
“Here at Witty and Wacky, we value all things illogical, flacky, and stupid. Therefore, we find your wisecracks, joshing, and irrational literature a HA of highest order. You elevate puns to daffy escapades, your one-liners leave us as empty-headed ninnies, and your gags are anything but offbeat. It has been a ludicrious journey and wish to put up with your tomfoolery again in the future.”\n Along with Witty and Wacky Inc.’s message, a large bonus was added to the contracted amount. Though why they went out of their way to make their logo sing about the bonus is anyone’s guess.
“Dear Sir, Madam, or Thing,\nAs the period between the life and death of this commission has passed, Witty and Wacky Inc. has decided not to extend this parody of a commission further. As there were a few HAs and many stifled snigger at your provided work, we will be paying you equivalent to the contract amount of an absurdist in our puns department.\n May your days be nonsensical and full of buffoonery,\n Witty and Wacky Inc. ”
The website's editor sighed as {0.SimFirstName} submitted a meaningless listicle, designed to drive clicks without having anything of significance to say. {0.SimFirstName} had seen this weary look on editor's faces before... The recognition that this isn't what they envisioned their life being when they earned their journalism degree. Oh well; not {0.SimFirstName}'s problem! On to the next gig.
Clicks are pouring in from across the internet as readers debate the wild claims {0.SimFirstName} laid out in an article which was clearly devised to drive controversy and outrage. The website's editor couldn't be happier - {0.SimFirstName} even went so far as to format the article across a paginated slideshow, ginning up even more revenue! Happily, the gig's contract included revenue sharing after meeting a certain click threshold, resulting in some extra money making its way into {0.SimFirstName}'s pocket.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete one of the simplest tasks imaginable... churning out some clickbait drivel. Thankfully the website's editor didn't particularly care; after all, freelancers like {0.SimFirstName} are a dime a dozen. {0.SimFirstName} still managed to get paid for the portion of the work {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to complete, so the gig wasn't a total write off.
While the topic of {0.SimFirstName}’s article wasn’t too interesting, {F0.her}{M0.his} writing was able to punch it up enough to catch the attention of Fab Magazine editors. Enough so to get its headline featured as one of the additional articles mentioned on the cover. Not bad for a story covering a few lesser known Plumbob Picture stars.
Nothing beats a good break up article. Using pictures and information provided by Fab Magazine, {0.SimFirstName} was able to craft a heartbreaking article featuring two of Plumbob Picture’s most prominent stars and how their love was torn apart by studio schedules, nightly parties, and a secret lover. Fab Magazine gushed about it so much, they used it as the cover article for their latest issue and gave {0.SimFirstName} a little extra when finalizing the contract.
{0.SimFirstName} missed Fab Magazine’s deadline, causing their article to be cut from the tabloid. While {F0.she}{M0.he} was compensated for what writing they already finishing, this mistake might affect {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation as a writer.
{0.SimName} did a lot of back and forth with the client, arguing whether 4 should be higher or lower on the list.  In the end, {F0.she}{M0.he} got {F0.her}{M0.his} way, though.
{0.SimName} had clearly been keeping a list ahead of time. Split across 10 separate webpages, the top-10 list monetized greatly!
Only being able to come up with a list of 8, it wasn't much of a top-10. {0.SimFirstName} got paid appropriately for that work, though.
 'Bumbling Baby Bubalus' checks the right boxes. This may not be the instant classic we were hoping for, but it will be some child's treasured book.
 'Vulpes Counts the Critters of the Mauven Forest' is on track to be the number #1 children's book this holiday season. It is also reported that toddlers who read this book now need both hands to show how high they can count.
 'Alternate Uses for a Pet Yorier' is not what we expect out of a children's book. The detailed chapter on how they can be used in life or death survival situations alone is enough to get this pulled from store shelves. Please do not return to this office.
The story rewrites {0.SimName} did really helped with the story flow, really helping with the bedtime part of the stories. Just reading them made the client sleepy. In a good way.
The stories {0.SimName} wrote are perfect for children. They'll learn important lessons, but also the parents will thank {F0.her}{M0.him} for the time they gain back each night once the kids are asleep. 
The client tells {0.SimName} teddy bears aren't meant to have conquering armies and epic love stories. It's a great concept, but it's both a little too mature and exciting for children. {F0.she}{M0.he} got paid a little less, since the work won't be used. 
{0.SimFirstName}'s character concepts made it to the film's producers just in time. As an industry outsider, they mentioned that {M0.his}{F0.her} creations aren't quite film ready, but they're still quite thankful to have received {M0.his}{F0.her} help.
The film's producers are overjoyed with {0.SimFirstName}'s character concept creations! Each of {M0.his}{F0.her} designs are film ready, and the costume and makeup artists are already hard at work translating {M0.his}{F0.her} concepts into outfits for the film's stars. As a thanks for keeping the film production schedule on track, they've promised to feature {0.SimFirstName}'s name in the title sequence, and have added extra money to his payment.
Plumbob Pictures executives are outraged that they still had to pay {0.SimFirstName} a portion of the gig's payout, despite the fact that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't complete all goals. In a retaliatory move, they leaked {M0.his}{F0.her} identity to the striking workers, naming {0.SimPronounObjective} as the scab that agreed to replace them.
The game's producers are pleased with the characters that {0.SimFirstName} created, and confirmed that his designs would appear in the final game. Not only was the pay good, but {0.SimFirstName} is now excitedly looking forward to seeing {M0.his}{F0.her} characters come to life within a digital world!
It's hard to stand out when you're a nameless cog in a large machine, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to do so with {M0.his}{F0.her} stellar character creations. As a sign of thanks, the development team gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a bonus payment, and even image mapped {M0.his}{F0.her} face onto one of the enemies in the game, so that {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll be digitally immortalized!
{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the requested work, and as a result did not receive a complete payment. The game's producers mentioned that they'd wished {0.SimFirstName} had simply put in extra time to get the work done, and to not expect further contracts in the future if this is the way {M0.he}{F0.she} professionally conducts {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.
The indie dev {0.SimFirstName} submitted {M0.his}{F0.her} character designs to had an air of pretension that rubbed {0.SimFirstName} the wrong way. They may have been looking for passionately crafted art, but {0.SimFirstName} was just looking to get paid... and in that sense, it all worked out just fine.
{0.SimFirstName} found {M0.himself}{F0.herself} on the exact same wavelength as the indie dev, and the two of them were obviously jiving when it came to each other's passion for art. The dev was over the moon for {0.SimFirstName}'s characters! Despite having to work within a very strict budget, they still managed to slip {M0.him}{F0.her} a small bonus payment to show their appreciation.
It turns out that {0.SimFirstName}'s passion for character designs didn't match that of the indie dev who contracted {M0.him}{F0.her}, as {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't complete all of the expected goals on time. Still, {M0.he}{F0.she} got paid a bit for the portion that {M0.he}{F0.she} did accomplish, and handed the entirety of it off to the dev for them to do whatever they want with it.
Writing the stories for the long-passed and filling out family tree reports for interested parties, {0.SimFirstName} helped connect people to their pasts.
Making sense of complicated letters, stories, and lineage maps, {0.SimFirstName} helped many people connect with their long-lost (or otherwise unknown) families! Winterfest is going to be a much bigger event this year, thanks to {F0.her}{M0.his} work.
{0.SimFirstName}'s contract was cut short for making all the wrong kinds of connections. They're not suggestions, they're historical! Still, they agreed to pay the minimum for the work done.
The client is pleased with {0.SimName}'s writing. Though, he seems to think anyone would have done well, given the source material. 
{0.SimName} really captured what makes the client important and great. He can't wait for the world to find out about how awesome he is at that thing that he was so important. He'll definitely keep {0.SimName} in mind for a followup book about the next fantastic thing he does.
After reading the biography, the client wonders if {0.SimName} was really listening to how amazing he was. He gave feedback suggesting it was too &quot;real.&quot; They agree to end the contract with a prorated fee.
Whew, paintings can start to get really risqué when the nectar starts to flow. Ultimately though, everyone had fun and went home happy - and most importantly, {0.SimFirstName} got paid.
The nectar and painting class went off without a hitch. So many of the happy participants signed up for another class, that not only did the program's owners pay {0.SimFirstName} a bonus, they actually painted and hung a portrait of {M0.him}{F0.her} in the lobby of the building!
The nectar and painting class's proprietors are displeased that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to finish all of the goals, but begrudgingly paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a portion of the agreed upon payment for the part {M0.he}{F0.she} did complete.
{0.SimFirstName} wasn't sure how {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} deal with an unruly classroom of students, but to {M0.his}{F0.her} surprise, everyone was attentive, well behaved, and ready to learn. {M0.He}{F0.She} collected {M0.his}{F0.her} paycheck, and went about {M0.his}{F0.her} day... The more you know!
{0.SimFirstName} will never admit it, but {M0.he}{F0.she} greatly enjoyed booting an unruly student out of class. Everyone else was remarkably well behaved though; one student even gave {M0.him}{F0.her} an apple to show their gratitude! Word of {0.SimFirstName}'s great job reached the dean, who paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a little bonus for a job well done.
Having not completed all of {M0.his}{F0.her} expected goals, the art students went untaught for the day, and are angrily lodging complaints to the dean's office. Per the substitute professor contract, {0.SimFirstName} still managed to walk away with a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay.
{0.SimFirstName} took pride in teaching the camp's self-proclaimed &quot;artists of tomorrow&quot;. While {M0.he}{F0.she} isn't 100% certain they'll all live up to that lofty aspiration, {M0.he}{F0.she} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} did her part to usher them down the right path.
{0.SimFirstName}'s heart swelled with joy at the opportunity to pass down {M0.his}{F0.her} artistic skills to the next generation of talented painters. The children's eyes were wide with wonder as {M0.he}{F0.she} gave {M0.his}{F0.her} demonstration, and they leapt to action in an attempt to recreate {M0.his}{F0.her} painting. The counselors expressed their gratitude by letting {0.SimFirstName} sign the wall of one of the camp's cabins, as well as slipping {0.SimPronounObjective} a bonus payment.
The camp's counselors are distressed that {0.SimFirstName} did not complete all of the assigned goals. Who will properly teach the youth now?! It got even worse for them when they read the fine print of the contract, and discovered they still owned {0.SimFirstName} partial pay for the portion of the work {M0.he}{F0.she} completed.

Believe it or not, I got the new job!
I did it, I got the job! Now my dreams are closer than ever!
Remember that job we talked about? I got it!
Guess who just got a promotion? No, not you, it was me! Success, here I come!
I can't believe it, they gave me the promotion!
Did you hear? I got the promotion we talked about! 
I ended it with {2.SimFirstName}. You and I should go out sometime to help me forget about {M2.him}{F2.her}.
{2.SimFirstName} is great! I’m glad I got to know them.
Are you sure we are talking about the same person? {2.SimFirstName} wasn’t so great…
Thanks for setting us up, {2.SimFirstName} and I are going out!
Why didn’t you tell me {M2.he}{F2.she} was already in a relationship?
That didn’t go so well. I don’t think we’ll be going out again.
I don’t see the point in talking to {2.SimFirstName} any more. But I guess I’ll just put on a face…
I agree, {2.SimFirstName} is not so great, {M2.he}{F2.she} is not cool.
{2.SimFirstName} is great! 
I spoke with {2.SimFirstName} and find {M2.him}{F2.her} quite pleasing!
I don't know. {2.SimFirstName} didn’t seem that interesting.
I’m trying to understand why you wanted me to talk to {2.SimFirstName}…
{0.SimFirstName}! I gave {2.SimFirstName} a fair shot, but the end result was what I expected. Our values don't align and I'm not sure there's a way to work around that.
I'm glad you picked up, {0.SimFirstName}. I wanted to let you know that I spoke with {2.SimFirstName} and it was immediately obvious that this friendship wasn't going to work due to our differences.
Hello {0.SimFirstName}! I reached out to {2.SimFirstName}, but after getting to know {F2.her}{M2.him} a little better I realized that our personalities don't vibe well.
{0.SimFirstName}, {2.SimName} and I really hit it off... we're officially dating now!
{2.SimName} and I are... officially together! Thank you, {0.SimFirstName}!
Were you aware that {2.SimName} already has a partner? That information would have been helpful.
{0.SimFirstName}, it appears that {2.SimName} already has someone special. That would have been good to know...
{2.SimName} and I are two completely different people... that relationship was doomed to being with!
I thought you knew what I valued in a relationship {0.SimFirstName}! {2.SimName} and I will never see eye to eye.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, why did you hook me up with {2.SimName}? We're not even close to being compatible.
I just ended things with {2.SimFirstName}. I'm sad, but it will pass, won't it?
I finally broke up with {2.SimFirstName}. I wonder if that will open my horizons?
Remember when you told me I could do better? Well, I took your advice and broke up with {2.SimFirstName}!

{1.SimFirstName} and I have a little bun in the oven. I can't describe to you how excited I am to be having a baby!
How are you doing {0.SimFirstName}? {1.SimFirstName} said you would be thrilled to know we're expecting a baby soon!
Morning Sickness is nothing to take lightly! You might have guessed but, {1.SimFirstName} and I will be having a baby soon.
Thank you for our earlier conversation {0.SimFirstName}. {1.SimFirstName} and I are both on board and expect to deliver a baby soon!
{0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that I'm pregnant! {1.SimFirstName} and I will be expecting a little one soon!
Baby News! {1.SimFirstName} and I are pregnant, and I wanted to make sure you heard it from me first.
Try for that baby!
We've been thinking about Trying for a Baby lately. Do you think we should do it? We want to, but we're not sure. It's a huge responsibility! What do you think?
You should decide for yourself.
Yes! It's a lot of work, but you've got it.
Yes! I mean, I wouldn't. But you should!
No! That sounds exhausting!
No, I don't think it's a good idea.
A child? They are annoying, don't do it!
Say yes!
Don't do it!
So I found a ring in {2.SimFirstName}'s bag. I think {M2.he}{F2.she} is going to propose to me. I don't know what to do! What should I say!? Yes!? No!? Gahh!?
You should really decide for yourself.
Oh geez... um, oh gosh... uh... Yes! Do it
If you need to ask me, your heart is not in it!
After thinking about it more thoroughly I realized that a career change is not in the cards for me. I do however appreciate your concern, so thank you {0.SimFirstName}!
Hey there {0.SimFirstName}. As inspiring as our recent discussion was, I don't think right now is a good time for me to switch careers.
{0.SimFirstName}! I wanted to let you know that I've been looking for a new career, but haven't found anything of interest. It looks like I'll be sticking with this one for now.
{0.SimFirstName}! I'm happy you answered and I have exciting news to share. I switched careers!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I was thinking about our conversation the other day and decided to go for it. I changed my career!
I've been pondering your advice {0.SimFirstName}, and you're right! I should be doing what makes me happy so I switched careers.
No, I don't think you are up for it.
Yes, you should totally go for it!
Do it! Aim for the stars!
That would mean more work, don't do it!
That should be up to you.
More money and prestige, but more work and responsibility. Should I try to get a promotion?
I heard my boss saying I would be a good candidate for a promotion. Do you think I can do it?
There is a rumor at my workplace that someone will get a promotion! Should I try to impress my boss to get it?
A new job? Fantastic, go for it!
I don't think you should do it.
Yeah, I think you should try a new career!
You should follow your heart.
A job? That's too much work... Don't do it!
{0.SimFirstName}! I need to challenge myself! A new job might be the solution, what do you think?
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I feel like trying something new and exciting... something like changing careers! What do you think?
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I have been thinking of getting a new job, what do you think?

With more &lt;b&gt;Tummy Time&lt;/b&gt; practice, {0.SimFirstName} can learn how to roll over from {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} tummy to {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} back.
Despite literally learning to stand on {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} own two feet, {0.SimFirstName} will still need care and guidance for some time to come. In the meantime, look how tall {0.SimFirstName} has grown!
Pulled to Stand
{0.SimFirstName} developed the ability to lift {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} head on all {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} own. There's a whole world to look at!

Water Tool
With an empty hole dug into your lot, open the Terrain Tools section in Build Mode, then select the Water Tool category. Here, you'll find four buttons: Raise Water, Lower Water, Fill to Height, and Remove Water.\n\nTo turn a hole into a pond, you'll always start with the Raise Water button. With this button selected, the location you click within a hole is where the water line will fill to. If you click and hold, the water will incrementally continue to fill the hole until the water reaches the top.
If you want to reduce the amount of water that's filling a hole, use the Lower Water button. With this button selected, you can click on any water surface created by the Water Tool, and you will lower the water a small amount. You may also click and hold to continue lowering the water line until it reaches the desired depth within the hole.
Ponds can be decorated with a variety of objects, which can be found within the Outdoor Water Décor, and Water Features sections of Build Mode. In addition to placing decorative objects, you can select a Water Style to change the appearance of the water itself. In the Pond Effects category, you'll find cards you can place on the surface of a pond, which will attract designated wildlife or other effects to their location while in Live Mode.
When the Remove Water button is selected, any water surface you click on that was created by the Water Tool will be removed, and an empty hole in the terrain will be left behind. Any objects that were floating on the surface of the water will automatically be moved to your household's inventory when the water is removed.
The Fill to Height button allows you to select a specific height that you want the water line to be set at. This can be useful when you want the water line to be at the same height across multiple separate ponds.\n\nWith the Fill to Height button selected, you will see a white square adjacent to your cursor, which indicates the height at which water will fill to when clicked. A tooltip will also automatically appear that explains how to raise and lower the height of the white square, so that you can specify the precise height at which you want the water line set to.
Sims can fish in ponds that have been stocked with fish and have a Fishing Sign in them. Ponds can be stocked with any discovered fish in your Household Collections. Explore the world to find different types of fish, bring them back, and stock them in your home's pond for convenient future fishing!
Before using the Water Tool to add a pond, lake, tributary, or any other naturally occurring water feature to your lot, you're going to need a hole to put all that water in. Visit the Terrain Manipulation lesson if you need additional information on how to dig a hole into your lot's terrain.
Having areas of shallow water along the edge of a pond is essential if you want Sims to interact with the pond. In addition, some objects (&lt;i&gt;for example - Water Emitters&lt;/i&gt;) are only allowed to be placed in shallow water within ponds. To help with this, you can enable the Water Depth Map, which is a checkbox located within the Water Tool. This visualization will show the shallow areas of your pond in bright green, and will fade to blue in deeper water.\n\nYou can also use the Terrain Manipulation tools while the Water Depth Map is turned on, allowing you see how shallow or deep a pond is as you adjust the terrain underneath it. You can press the &quot;P&quot; key to toggle the Water Depth Map on and off in either of these two Build tools.

High School F Student
It’s a proud moment in any kid’s life when they make the transition from “failing student” to “barely passing student.” With enough effort, {0.SimFirstName} will claw {M0.his}{F0.her} way up to “average” in no time. And THAT’S when doors start to open...
High School D Student
{0.SimFirstName} can now earn passing grades in all of {M0.his}{F0.her} subjects easily. But {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t want to stop there! Now that {0.SimFirstName}'s discovered an aptitude for learning, it’s time to see how far {M0.he}{F0.she} can go!
High School C Student
{0.SimFirstName} has worked very hard to get here. It can now be said, with confidence, that {0.SimFirstName} is earning “good grades.” But that’s not where the glory is. If {M0.He}{F0.She} can just push {M0.himself}{F0.herself} a little harder, {0.SimFirstName} can earn straight A’s!
High School B Student
It took a lot of work, but {0.SimFirstName} has turned {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into an honor-rolling, test-acing, A-plussing machine. {M0.He}{F0.She}'ll forget more over lunch than some students will learn in a lifetime. For {M0.him}{F0.her}, the future is limitless! 
High School A Student
Children go to school so that knowledge can be stuffed into their little heads and so they can be prepared for life.
Let's not sugar coat things.  You're failing.  But you've still got time to turn it around!  Do some homework - any homework - and go to school.
Grade School F Student
When Ds are the norm, things aren't bleak quite yet, but the teacher has called home a few times and you're right on the edge of failing out of school.
Grade School D Student
The middle of the pack is the most popular place to be, as evidenced by the other C students that surround you.  It's like a club!  A non-exclusive mediocre club.
Grade School C Student
Rocking a solid B is nothing to be ashamed about. By definition, it's above average! Of course, there are still those A students that are doing just a little bit better.
Grade School B Student
It must be hard to be an A student.  All that time studying, feeling superior, and studying some more.
Grade School A Student
Bravo, {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} will bring the crowd to its feet at nearly every sold-out performance. Applause? Roses? Room keys? These things are offered up to {0.SimFirstName} on a regular basis now. Encore!
Concert Virtuoso
Strings, winds, woods, brass. {0.SimFirstName} has mastered them all, and {M0.his}{F0.her} remarkable gifts are remarked upon quite often. Fame is {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent}, and {0.SimFirstName}'s working on fortune. Just not enough fortune for {0.SimPronounObjective} to say no to that web startup launch party.
Instrumental Wonder
All the world’s a stage, and {0.SimFirstName} has earned {M0.his}{F0.her} place upon it. {M0.He}{F0.She} is still putting bread in {M0.his}{F0.her} jar playing weddings and private parties, but the guest list and grub is getting better every time, and {M0.he}{F0.she} occasionally lifts {M0.his}{F0.her} spirits with satisfying stints in lesser-known symphony orchestras.
Symphonic String Player
From posh private parties to shopping mall foyers to weddings for the web-date weary, {0.SimFirstName} is in high demand. Whether {M0.his}{F0.her} client wants guests to dance, buy hopelessly expensive trinkets, or pipe down until they say their vows, {0.SimFirstName}'s got the tunes to get results.
Professional Pianist
{0.SimFirstName} has always known that {M0.he}{F0.she} is more than just a {M0.hunk of love}{F0.pretty face}. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} got TALENT. And the instant {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers touch the keys of a piano or the strings of a guitar, everyone in the room knows it. These days, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} even got gigs to prove it.
Serious Musician
Who needs name recognition when everyone recognizes your song? {0.SimFirstName} will be busy creating jingles that lodge themselves into people’s brains so tightly, it would take highly invasive surgery to get them back out. So what if they’re about cat food, or toilet cleaner? No one can flush them away, not ever!
Jingle Jammer
Doors are starting to open for {0.SimFirstName}. And {M0.he}{F0.she} is starting to open for some pretty cool acts. Audiences actually laugh when they’re supposed to. Applause is not unheard of (or unheard). It may not be time to try the old “Don’t you know who I am?” trick yet, but it’s coming....
Opening Act
C-List is better than no list at all! Why, {0.SimFirstName} is even starting to book a few gigs. At this point, {M0.his}{F0.her} ability to shamelessly promote {M0.himself}{F0.herself} may be a greater asset than any true talent!
C-Lister
{0.SimFirstName} was born to perform. It’s written in the stars! Of course, with the stars as {M0.his}{F0.her} only reference, open mics are {0.SimFirstName}’s only viable path to discovery and fame. The hardest part is suffering all these amateurs who can only book open mics!
Open Mic Seeker
If a joke is told in a comedy club, and nobody’s there to hear it, does it make a sound? As an amateur entertainer, {0.SimFirstName} is about to find out. At least there are no hisses or projectiles!
Amateur Entertainer
Joke by joke, {0.SimFirstName} has climbed the ranks of comedy, and now {M0.his}{F0.her} sets are setting new standards in the industry. An entire generation of comics will one day point back to {0.SimFirstName} as their inspiration. {0.SimFirstName} is rolling in dough, fame, and fans.
Show Stopper
Just like that, {0.SimFirstName} is the big name on the marquee! Up-and-coming acts are excited to open for {0.SimPronounObjective}. The work is steady, pays well, and {0.SimFirstName} has even caught a few people on the street referencing {M0.his}{F0.her} material and cracking each other up. Not bad!
Stand Up Star
{0.SimFirstName} is done flying under the radar. {M0.He}{F0.She} is making some serious dough hosting charity events, awards ceremonies, roasts, and pretty much any other kind of party no one actually wants to attend. {M0.He}{F0.She} may even be Sim of Honor at a cheapskate celebrity wedding!
Roast Master
{0.SimFirstName} is doing a stand-up job with {M0.his}{F0.her} stand-up routine, and people are starting to stand up and take notice. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} can cut them back down with a few quick jokes! ({M0.His}{F0.Her} jokes are better than these.)
Rising Comedian
Wow, {0.SimFirstName} can really keep a crowd captive, no handcuffs required! {M0.He}{F0.She} is spending less time peddling business cards and more time practicing one-liners, “squirrel walks into a bar” jokes, and impressions that people actually recognize.
Solid Storyteller
The ideas are really flowing for {0.SimFirstName} now. On stage, off stage, at weddings, at funerals. Everything is a source for hilarious new material! And who doesn’t like a good joke?
Jokesmith
{0.SimFirstName} is now a Line Cook! {M0.His}{F0.Her} duties include station setup, prepping food, cleaning up and stocking. Basically everything the real cooks don't want to do!
Line Cook
The secret to Mixology is proportion. How much sweet juice? How much sour juice? Does this troubled patron want {0.SimFirstName}'s advice, or just for someone to listen? Is this a real job, or just something people do for money until they find a real job?
Mixologist
Standing behind food stations unable to eat the food is never easy, but it's the new reality for {0.SimFirstName}. {M0.His}{F0.Her} days will now be filled with ridiculous dancing at weddings, failed team-building exercises, and really weird baby shower games.
Caterer
As the Head Dishwasher, {0.SimFirstName} can choose which dishes {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to wash. Hard to scrub pots and pans are no longer an issue, unless {0.SimFirstName} wants them to be. Only the most beautiful china are now placed in {0.SimFirstName}’s hands.
Head Dishwasher
Time to do the work of a common household appliance! {0.SimFirstName} will be scrubbing plates, ensuring crystal glasses have no leftover lipstick residue, and striking up conversations with Sims who couldn't pay their tab!
Assistant Dishwasher
Some might say {0.SimFirstName} has sold out to gain mainstream status, but {0.SimFirstName} cannot hear them. {M0.He}{F0.She} is relaxing in {M0.his}{F0.her} private office, eating hors d’oeurves in front of the fireplace, and considering the latest contract for a new TV show, cook book, and servingware line.
Celebrity Chef
Congratulations to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} is now the master of the kitchen. Yelling at underlings, demanding things be re-cooked, screaming at underlings, reprimanding underlings -- it's all possible now!
Executive Chef
Second-in-command isn't bad at all! Now {0.SimFirstName} can do some REAL work without getting any of the credit. But hey, with a little time and a lot of effort {0.SimFirstName} will be the one running things around here!
Sous Chef
Pastries are a tricky thing to master. They must be delicious enough to justify the calories, but also beautiful enough to catch the customer's eye. {0.SimFirstName} is branching out into real food artistry!
Pastry Chef
The world of private parties now belongs to {0.SimFirstName}! Forget the small-time events, now {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to enjoy short-deadline corporate events, birthday parties for children with more money than {M0.he}{F0.she} has, and incredibly particular brides!
Head Caterer
Some might say {0.SimFirstName} has sold out to gain mainstream status, but {0.SimFirstName} cannot hear them. {M0.He}{F0.She} is relaxing in {M0.his}{F0.her} private office, sipping an amazing drink in front of the fireplace, and considering the latest contract for a new TV show, cook book, and glassware line.
Celebrity Mixologist
{0.SimFirstName} has really proven {M0.himself}{F0.herself} when it comes to concocting amazing drinks. Students from all over the world will flock to {M0.his}{F0.her} side, eager to learn from The Great Drinkmaster! There will be magic. Oh yes.\nThere will be magic.
Drinkmaster
Coordinating orders at a corporate level is no easy feat, but {0.SimFirstName} is ready to be the next big CDO. {M0.His}{F0.Her} high-demand drinks are now made in large batches and are then shipped out to various restaurants.
Chief Drink Operator
A drink specialist at a nearly divine level, {0.SimFirstName} will be helping clients pair mixed drinks with a variety of meals and desserts. They may swoon as their tastebuds are overwhelmed by a culinary WooHoo of flavors.
Juice Boss
A master of doling out advice and a master of mixing fruity drinks, {0.SimFirstName} is now the Head Mixologist! It might be time to start charging therapist rates...
Head Mixologist
Bent on taking down the old world order, a team of top hackers, ghosts, and demons takes cues from a single source. {0.SimFirstName} has become the chosen one. {M0.His}{F0.Her} army of angsty teens and disgruntled introverts has its finger on the red button controlling everything.
The Oracle
{0.SimFirstName} has really stepped up {M0.his}{F0.her} game.{M0.He}{F0.She} creates viruses that topple international corporations and incites civil wars by releasing sensitive government documents (okay, that second one might have been an accident).
Net Demon
Now hidden behind endless aliases, no one really knows {0.SimFirstName}. {M0.He}{F0.She} sits alone, in a sleek office, overseeing the off-shore diversion of funds by an elite hacker team, while stroking a black cat.
Anonymous Ghost
{0.SimFirstName} has managed to earn the respect of other hackers, a group not valued for an overabundance of respect! They look to {M0.him}{F0.her} for advice on how to work around the toughest security measures while covering their tracks.
Elite Hacker
{0.SimFirstName} can now commit cyber crime from the comfort of home, via email. &quot;Dear Uncle, I am important king in other country. You have won inheritance. Please send bank account password to receive my crown.&quot;
DigiThief
Wanna make a deal in this 'hood? You gotta go through {0.SimFirstName}. {M0.He}{F0.She} worked {M0.his}{F0.her} way up to running the racket on this turf, from that botanical garden over there, all the way down to the new organic grocery store.
Minor Crimelord
It's time for {0.SimFirstName} to give up the misdemeanors. What is {M0.he}{F0.she}, a baby? Time to put on the big {M0.boy}{F0.girl} pants and pull the big {M0.boy}{F0.girl} crimes: felonies. Maybe {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} even plan a heist!
Felonius Monk
Switching to management is never easy. Will your gang remember to rob the bank before it closes? Can the goon have a sick day when he's scheduled to work the riot? Fortunately, {0.SimFirstName} knows how to lead a ring of delinquents into trouble, like a total boss.
Ringleader
Are those candy bars in your pocket? Where did you get that lovely old-lady-style purse? {0.SimFirstName} is now in charge of outfitting the bosses with snacks for the interrogation room and birthday gifts for their mother-in-laws, using {M0.his}{F0.her} five finger discount.
Petty Thief
Every criminal mastermind needs an entry-level bodyguard with irrational anger issues. {0.SimFirstName} will beef up doorways and rumble through dark alleys, keeping rivals at bay with those three little words, &quot;Whaddayou lookin' at?&quot;
Tough {M0.Guy}{F0.Gal}
What's even better than being The Brains of the organization? Being The Brains' boss! Now {0.SimFirstName}'s crew can do all the work, while {M0.he}{F0.she} takes a bath in §1000 bills. Who cares if it's dirty money when there's so much of it?
The Boss
{0.SimFirstName} has finally earned {M0.his}{F0.her} PhD... from the STREETS. As the brains of {M0.his}{F0.her} own organization, {0.SimFirstName} will plan the big jobs, make the big scores, and bring home the big Simoleons.
The Brains
{0.SimFirstName} has proven {M0.his}{F0.her} strength and dexterity. Now, the big bosses have given {0.SimPronounObjective} a stethoscope, a drill, and a map of target banks. Doors are finally opening for {0.SimFirstName}. Literally.
Earned a Raise
{0.SimFirstName} has been given a raise as {1.String} for superior work performance!\n\n{M0.He}{F0.She} will now make an additional {6.Money} per hour, for a grand total of {5.Money} per hour.

Caught with a Bib
Well, that's a bit embarrassing.
Unified Team
It feels good to be able to coordinate and get through a player--and a loudmouth--short.
Reevaluating Key Underlings
Painter's Eye
It's like perfect pitch for painters.
Office Downtime
Sometimes some rest is all one needs to feel up to the task at hand.
No One's Working
It wouldn't do to leave a suspect cuffed to a railing overnight, would it?
Why are life lessons never pleasant?

What does it mean when a squad is taken down by a little kid?

The best revenge is stealing the whole competition.

Who knew having someone in a fuzzy suit cheering could feel so good?
Outdated Artist

Congratulations on completing the Welcome Scenario!\n\nAs a reward, each Sims in this household have earned unique rewards based on their accomplishments and choices, as well as enough Satisfaction Points to purchase a treat in the Rewards Store! \n\nYou have created a great start for your Sims, but their stories are far from finished! 
Promotions will often reward you with mood boosting items that your Sims store in the Household Inventory. Place them in your lot to benefit from their effect.
Some reward traits will make your Sim build skills faster. Morning Sim boosts skill gain during the day, while Night Owl boosts skill gain during the night. Choose wisely!
Negative emotions like Tension, Anger or Sadness can block your Sim from learning new skills!\n\nYou can find more information about Moodlets in Lessons under the &quot;Live Mode&quot; category.
Yes, I knew I could count on you, Nova! Here's the deal about my secret beverage: It is THE fastest way to learn skills. However... make sure you go to the toilet before you drink it, the Snaggle Fluster can be very diuretic! I sometimes program while at the toilet to be more efficient.
Alright, alright… Let’s continue being normies.
I hope pepperoni is still your favorite!
Don't worry, we'll get to hang out aaall day at the office. See you there, tuna head!
What kind of housewarming party is right for you? If a night of dancing and drinks is your thing, I suggest a house party. If you’re looking for something more intimate, a dinner party is the perfect choice—as long as you can cook a meal without burning down your new house!\n\nPreparations aren't necessary but a little goes a long way! You could play some nice music, clean the dishes, and freshen up. Is your home missing anything? Perhaps a bar to serve drinks, or a proper dining table? Buy it! Some nice decor doesn’t hurt, either!\n\nWhenever you’re ready, just pick up your phone and invite people over. At this point, you can also hire caterers, bartenders, and more—if your wallet allows it!\n\nDon’t worry, you’ve got this! Can’t wait, see you soon!
Don't you mean, &quot;Tell me more about social Skills, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt;?&quot; You’re lucky I called!\n\nIf you believe a good joke is the way to a Sim’s heart, focus your efforts on the Comedy skill. Everyone loves an entertainer!\n\nMischief is a precarious social skill; some Sims love being pranked, while others despise it. But if you master the art of mischief, you’ll be able to bring a smile to the most dour of Sims.\n\nThe most important social Skill, in my opinion, is Charisma. Not only will you develop new relationships faster, but all of your social interactions will also become more powerful and likely to succeed! If you want to become a great comedian or prankster, it pays off to improve your Charisma, too.
Have you tried this new energy drink, &quot;Moodlet Solver&quot;? It makes me so pumped, I could party all night!

You should totally ask them out! And then you should &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; tell me eeevery little detail. Don’t forget to freshen up in the mirror first, it always gets me in a Flirty mood. Crossing my fingers for you!
You should try getting in a Confident mood, I find it helps a lot in social situations. Speaking of which, I’ll go psych myself up in the mirror. I can’t wait to meet the rest of your friends!

{0.SimFirstName} stepped into the portal, and was whisked away to the sunny pasture once again.\n\nThe glowing tree did not bear any fruit this time, however upon the ground a short distance beyond it, was the elusive Cowplant Berry!\n\n{0.SimFirstName} pocketed the find moments before the same whisking returned {M0.him}{F0.her} home.
{0.SimFirstName} stepped into the portal, but didn't find the familiar sunny pasture. {M0.He}{F0.She} did hear some strange humming, and followed the sound until {M0.he}{F0.she} kicked into a crystal.\n\nAs {0.SimFirstName} picked up the crystal, {M0.he}{F0.she} felt the familiar queasiness that happens when being ejected from The Mystical Magic Bean Portal Tree.
We're receiving reports of a potential time traveler in town.\n\nTheir identity, origin, and purpose remain unconfirmed. However, several Sims have noted the distinct blue hair of this new arrival that they believe to be Emit Relevart.\n\nOver to you, Ginny.
My friend had this muy caliente dress that was perfect for dancing. But it's been missing for a while now.
Missing Items
There was this old song that...how did it go? La la la la di da?
I planned this big surprise party for the neighborhood, but the cake I ordered never arrived!
Come to think of it, I have an alarm clock I really love that's gone missing. I just thought I had misplaced it.
I haven't noticed anything missing, but then again, I don't pay much attention. Sorry.
Someone told me they saw a flash of light while they were near the park.
I was just at the park and I think I saw someone matching that description.
I was just out Sim watching and heard a loud bang. Maybe that's what you're looking for?
No, haven't seen anyone like that. I'd try the park, everyone hangs out there.
Emit? Nope, don't know an Emit. Knew a Skip once. I wonder whatever happened to him?
Emit's Location
Oh, if you find a time traveler, let me know. I have a lot of questions to ask.
Is that even possible? I think you've been reading too much Wells.
A time traveler? Time doesn't exist beyond the present.
I wish I could time travel! Of course you have to worry about the re-entry. A building that wasn't there, that is there...it boggles the mind.
If I could travel through time, do you think I would be here and not with the dinosaurs!?

Make sure you know how to fish. You'll need it if you want to make Ambrosia.
I seem to recall Ambrosia is a gourmet food.
Ambrosia?! I'm not sure how to make it, but I would love to learn and bring a ghost back to life.
If you want to make Ambrosia, you'll need to be willing to get your hands a bit dirty.
I've heard that you need to have mastered the Cooking and Gourmet cooking skills.
Why are you asking me about Ambrosia? I haven't heard anything!
Can't you just look Ambrosia up on a computer?

What? You don't think I'd make a good parent?! I'd be an amazing parent!! We're going to go Try for a Baby &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;. Take that, ha!
Decide for myself? That's too hard!
Alright... well... I think... yes! We'll do it! Thanks for the advice. We're having a baby!
You think so? I guess you are right. Thanks for giving me a reality check.
What do &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; want? I don't know what I want! I wanted you to decide for me. It's obvious I can't count on you for huge and impactful life decisions that don't really concern you. Thanks for nothing, {0.SimName}.
You're right, of &lt;b&gt;course&lt;/b&gt; I should say yes! What was I thinking!? OMG I can't believe this is happening.
You think so? I wasn't sure... but you're right. I guess it just wasn't written in the stars.
Thanks! I was nervous, but now I'm excited!
Yeah, I can do this! Watch me get promoted!
Thank you for the encouragement, I will try to get it!
Maybe you're right... I don't want the extra responsibility!
I would have a lot less free time... I don't want this after all.
If you think so, you are probably right...
Make my own decisions? With no one to guide my actions? Why does this feel weird?
A promotion would mean more responsibility... Is this what I really want? I'll give it more thought.
I was hoping you would suggest something! You're right, though. I should decide for myself.
You are right, I should go for it!
Yes! I'll go for the new job!
Look out new career, here I come!
Really? I guess I should stay in my lane after all...
You're right. Maybe it's not a good idea after all!
You're probably right. I should stay put for now.
I don't know right now! I'll take some time to consider.
It's a big change. I'll have to think on it.
But I called you so I didn't have to decide myself!

&quot;Look at my outfit!

{0.SimFirstName} has met {1.SimFirstName} while at school!
Make Up Homework Complete
{0.SimFirstName} has completed {M0.his}{F0.her} Make Up Homework for the day.
Extra Credit Complete
“{M0.Prince}{F0.Princess} of Pranks.” “Destroyer of {1.String}” All titles bestowed upon {0.SimFirstName} for {M0.his}{F0.her} maniacal ingenuity when decorating the gym for the {1.String} Dance. Sure, {M0.he}{F0.she} got in a bit of trouble with the teachers, but that’s part of the fun! All of the school thinks {0.SimFirstName} is hilarious and the dance was way better than it would have been otherwise.
Why decorate for a {1.String} Dance when you could sabotage it instead? That was the thought anyway. {0.SimFirstName} probably should have just decorated like {M0.he}{F0.she} said {M0.he}{F0.she} would. Not only were the pranks disappointing rather than funny, but when the teacher bit into a cookie covered in ketchup—they knew exactly who to blame. {0.SimFirstName} spent the rest of the day sitting in the hall while everyone else had fun.
{0.SimFirstName} might have been tasked with setting up for “a {1.String} Dance,” but instead, {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} be setting up for “THE {1.String} Dance.” With a flurry of banners, streamers, cookies and punch (not literally—that would be messy), {0.SimFirstName} decorated the gym for a {1.String} Dance that would be remembered for years to come!
{0.SimFirstName} went in with hopes ablaze! {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} planned to make this the best {1.String} dance ever! That was before {M0.he}{F0.she} saw what {M0.he}{F0.she} had to work with. Crumpled decorations. No snacks. Polka music! To make matters worse, nobody else had volunteered. When the dance started, everyone blamed {0.SimFirstName} for the lame time they had.
It took most of the day for {0.SimFirstName} to work up the nerve and ask that special sim to the party, but it was totally worth it! {0.SimFirstName} stole shy glances at {M0.his}{F0.her} date as they congregated along the wall and awkwardly chatted about their classes, school sports, and the weather (which oddly had been much more active as of late)! By the time the party was over, {0.SimFirstName}’s heart was a flutter!
It took courage! That’s what {0.SimFirstName} would have to keep telling {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. The moment {M0.he}{F0.she} asked that special sim to the {1.String} Party, was the exact same moment {M0.he}{F0.she} got shot down. The response “No” had been instantaneous and followed by the cruel snickers of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates. {0.SimFirstName} spent the party hiding in the bathroom. Embarrassed. With a llama cookie—which was delicious but didn’t make up for what had just happened.
{0.SimFirstName} wasn’t interested in inviting anyone in particular. Instead, {M0.he}{F0.she} decided to focus simply on being the life of the party! While {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates indulged in awkward banter and ‘wallflowering,’ {0.SimFirstName} lead the charge for fun! Who delivered flowers to everyone in attendance? Who started a Chubby Llama competition? And who talked the teacher into playing the cool music? {0.SimFirstName}, of course! It was an epic school party that begged only one question: Whatever did {0.SimFirstName} do with the chaperones?
Was it the fact that {0.SimFirstName} went alone that made it the worst {1.String} School Party of all time? OR was it the fact that {M0.he}{F0.she} spilled punch all over {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, slipped on the floor, and then accidentally knocked down a teacher! Because, although {0.SimFirstName} felt pretty awkward standing along the wall alone, the whole knocking down a teacher thing was really bad.
“Sensitive, Sweet, Charming, Thought-provoking”—these are a few of the descriptors kids are whispering about {0.SimFirstName} in the halls. Some say, the school bully renounced his previous ‘taxation” on school lunches, the popular girls are allowing anyone to sit with them (even if they aren’t wearing pink), and nobody has been stuffed in a locker today—and all because of {0.SimFirstName}’s cards! Is this what being a teen legend feels like?

Gibbi Point
It's been many years since Gibbi Point experienced the Great Wave, a seismic event that swept through and helped carve out unique landmarks and created lush flora and fauna the likes of which many Sims had never expected to see! Once a part of a jellyfish processing industry, Jellyfish Junction more recently rebranded itself as an eccentric, artsy neighborhood with scenic harbor views. Crystal Valley has been transformed from a gold mining community into more subdued spot home to a large, feathered creature and the fabled Electric Lagoon. Wanderwood Wilds is a secluded, woodsy neighborhood where you can find Hothead Rock Geyser. The locals say it's a real blast. A peculiar climate, Gibbi Point's weather sees all seasons (even snow!); however, its many underground hot springs keep the waters tepid and inviting, allowing for swimming and water activities year-round.
Fluttery and Feathery
You'll want to fly over to Gibbi Point as fast as you can once you hear that it hosts many winged delights; from its unique butterfly and moth population to the storied Peculiar Plumbird, there's a flock-o-fun to be had here.
Outdoor Activities
Looking to spend a little more time taking in some fresh air, or looking to take on some new activities in general? Try your hand at archery or kayaking, or go for a little dive off the diving board at a pool. Unique festivals will have you dipping your toes into all sorts of outdoorsy endeavors.

Wend your way towards awe-inspiring natural landmarks such as Hothead Rock Geyser, the jellyfish-filled Electric Lagoon, and Underlight Bay.

Resident Grant
For teens and young adults, the place they live may offer grants providing students financial help in pursuing a university education. Each location has its own grant amounts, and students are encouraged to apply and represent their community!
Sports &amp; E-Sports Scholarships
There are a few scholarships that require Sims to participate in an after-school activity as part of their requirements. An Athletics scholarship requires the Sim to be a Soccer Team Player, while the E-Sports Scholarship requires the Sim to be E-Sports Competitor. A Sim cannot be accepted by both of these scholarships at the same time.
Career Scholarships
Universities want to encourage younger Sims that may already be dipping their toes in the job market. These scholarships offer teen and young adult Sims who have achieved some amount of career success with a way to help pay for a university education that can boost them in their career of choice in the future.
Skill Scholarships
Sims who have developed any number of practical skills are eligible to apply for a variety of skill-based scholarships. Those hours spent working on cooking, fishing, handiness, and many other skills can turn into scholarship funds! However, these scholarships are targeted at younger students and so are not available to adult or elder Sims.
Need-Based Scholarships
Every Sim deserves a university education, and the need-based Education for All and Helping Hand scholarships are designed to give Sims from households with less a chance to attend. Sims with less savings and assets are encouraged to apply!
Distinguished Scholarships
Sims who have been accepted into distinguished degree programs will automatically receive scholarships, with an amount based on how many distinguished degrees they’ve gotten into. Working on a Sim’s grade and skills before applying can lead to more degree acceptances and, in turn, more scholarship money!

Congratulations! You have a Horse! Owning a Horse is a way of life that requires hard work, training, and lots of care.\n\nTo properly care for a Horse, you'll need a handful of items. Stock up from Build Mode through &lt;b&gt;Objects by Room&lt;/b&gt;: go to the &lt;b&gt;Outdoors&lt;/b&gt; section and then &lt;b&gt;Animals&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nHelpful items may include:\n\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Animal Feeder&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Horse Water Trough&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Horse Bed&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! One Big Ball&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps or Barrels&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xA;
The Horse is in a &lt;font color='#1E81E6'&gt;neutral Mood&lt;/font&gt;, which has no impact on the chances of winning.
This Horse is in a &lt;font color='#008000'&gt;positive Mood&lt;/font&gt;, which slightly improves the chances of winning.
This Horse is asleep, which has no impact on the chances of winning.
This Horse is in a &lt;font color='#ff0000'&gt;negative Mood&lt;/font&gt;, which slightly reduces the chances of winning.

{1.String} is Over!
{1.String} was pretty good! {0.SimFirstName} got to do a lot of the things {M0.he}{F0.she} wanted to do... but... not everything. Next year {M0.he}{F0.she} hopes to do even more!

Challenge Scenarios
{0.SimFirstName} ran out of {2.ObjectCatalogName} to use as bait. {M0.He}{F0.She} will continue fishing without bait.
There's some fancy fish here that only nibble on flowers.
Discerning fish here enjoy the freshest of produce. Try some fruit on the line.
The rarest catches here are at the top of the food-chain. Baiting your line with a medium-sized fish might just lure them out.
Most fish here will eat almost anything - as long as it's organic, they're biting!
Some fish really need a bait they can sink their teeth into.
Prized catches here like to prey on small fish. Poor, small fish. 
Some fish here prefer munching on amphibians. Try using a Frog for bait.
These fish are biting at anything. As long as it's valuable, they're going for it!
The {3.String} {2.String} was drawn to {0.SimFirstName} due to {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} {5.String}. Right?

{0.SimName}'s familiar needs more room to answer their master's summons.
The preeminent symbol of magic and ancient knowledge. They have a strong connection to the moon and stoically follow their chosen Spellcaster.
When you need a protector that truly frightens your opponent consider the skull. It is hard not to be intimidated by this floating, haunting familiar.
Regal and powerful, this dragon should never be discounted based on its size. It is a formidable foe as well as a cherished companion.
Pure energy coalesced in the form of a tiny fairy familiar, it is impossible to make out any features beyond its magical wings. One can feel what can only be described as a slight spark when near.
Be warned to avoid the direct gaze of the glowfrog. They are usually quite mischievous characters although quite harmless when left to their own devices.

Picnic Table and Bench with Cushions
It was innovation time at the ol' Picnic and Bench factory. Jimmy Jean, Jeanie James, and Jamie Jim all took turns presenting their ideas for the board, and it was a cushion on the bench that won in the end.
Holiday Table
An elegant table designed for the holidays. Draped with beautiful printed fabric displaying star, snowflake and tree patterns. 100% polyester. Gift wrapping not available.
Holiday Wall Speaker
A great speaker for indoor and outdoor use. Listen to holiday music all day long. 
Faux Fireplace Facades
Tired of smoky residue in your flue, carrying heavy logs to your hearth, and spending unwanted effort on match striking? Put that all aside. Faux Fireplace Facades are the future my friends!\n\nBask in the glow of your imagination, and enter the world of tomorrow.
Garland with Pine Cones
When I was a kid, I always wanted to go to this mythical Gar Land place. I thought it was going to be this incredible fishing hole that only existed in December.\n\nImagine my disappointment. This is nice though yea? Yea. it's nice.
Handcrafted Holiday Etchings
You know how sometimes you go to those import stores, and you find something you know to be handcrafted. And it's marked down half price. And you think to yourself &quot;Is this the find?&quot; And you pick it up, looking for flaws, imperfections, and there are none. And you toss it in your cart, thinking &quot;It is, I found the holiday find!&quot;\n\nYea, I made that.
&quot;This&quot; Centerpiece
A holiday gathering? Of course, but in order to meet your &quot;festive quota&quot; for such a soiree, don't forget your checklist. Finger foods? Lavashly garnished beverages? Live music by an impoverished artist? An abundant supply of garish household décor? No, one can never have too much decor! Add “This” to your collection, and be envied by all!
Mason Jar Holiday Decor
My brother had a jar that he kept a cricket in when I was younger. He punched some holes in the lid, and would drop some grass and stuff in it occasionally, just to keep the little guy happy.\n\nThen he got a lizard. We never saw the cricket again.
Snowflake Replica
J.P. Frostbaum has done it again! Frozen water perfectly preserved in a plastic replica of a single newborn snowflake. No one else could have brought perfection like this to you. No one else loves faux decorative designing like J.P. No one loves you… like J.P.
Decorative Presents
Decorative Presents. Really? That's like decorative food. What’s the point? There are no calories and the point of food is calories.  If you take the time to wrap a present, put a present in the present! This is just twisted and cruel! Not cool. Happy Holidays?

Zoe lights up every room she enters. She's been passionate about dance since preschool, and her natural curiosity has led her to explore many difference dance forms and techniques. As a young Latinx woman, family and community are incredibly important to Zoe. She brings her values to life by volunteering as a youth dance teacher at a local community center. Someday, she may even manage to teach her boyfriend Jayden to dance as well!
These two are quite the couple. Gladys is always out looking for excitement in all the wrong ways and Vernon usually finds himself glooming over the tiny details in life.
While Valeria spent her early years with her mother's family in Japan, she left with her mom and dad to travel the world for her father's research work when she was still young. They haven't stopped moving since! Thankfully, she's kept in contact with her best friend, Emiko Mori! Now that she's an adult, she needs to figure out what to do with her life: adventure, explore her father's Venezuelan heritage, or take on a new challenge?
Tristen grew up an only child in Brindleton Bay. Despite being a quiet Sim, rural life never appealed to Tristen, so he moved to the city the first chance he got. Will his sarcastic wit shine through and help him make new friends despite being a loner? Who knows! But if not, a dog or cat are always an option... maybe even a roommate!
Tommi never really liked the name 'Tomasina,' so she's been 'Tommi' as long as she can remember. She's a business professional with big dreams! Unfortunately, she keeps getting passed up for promotions (that Sydney Wright gets). It must be Sydney's quick wit and huge vocabulary! Will a friendship ever develop or is it all downhill from here?
Tim Johnson, reared in the suit-and-tie world of metro Washington, D.C., secretly keeps a still-working skateboard under his bed to pay homage to his birthplace: sunny, gnarly, hella-good California. And every now and again, when no one is looking, he still rides it.
With a quick wit and a huge vocabulary, Sydney is quietly competitive, focused, and ambitious. She works at one of the nation's premiere business firms, where she's been promoted twice in under two years. As an only child, Sydney craves the real conversation and deeper connection you get in one-on-one friendships. Ever loyal, with incredibly high standards, Sydney is slow to let people into her inner circle. Once there, you're a friend for life.
Somewhere in an alternate dimension, a Steve Fogel exists that's a big-rig trucker. In this reality though, Steve has bigger career goals in mind... He dreams of being a space trucker, hauling cargo across the cosmos. It's this bold ambition that attracted his wife, June, to his side. With her healthy cooking, he will be spaceworthy in no time. As a natural goof, you may find him at a comedy club practicing his (harmless) one-liners on the crowd.
Sophia is a unique artist, as she's gifted with synesthesia. She's overwhelmed by colors as she walks through the world, which causes her to scurry home and put paint to canvas while images are still vivid in her mind. Though she tends to focus on her art in lieu of a social life, she still holds lingering feelings for Ollie Purdue, who she once had a brief fling with before he settled down.
For Sean, social norms are there to be broken. Of course, there isn't much to to rebel against in the idyllic neighborhood of Willow Creek, so Sean resorts to... unconventional means... On weekends, he beats children at chess in the park (cheating, if necessary.) He once made out with an elder, just to freak out his mom. He loves to self quote himself; his favorite being, &quot;I eat plaid for breakfast. Spikeburgers for lunch. No authority for dessert.&quot;
For Ross, everything needs to be clean, he doesn't like kids (aka germ-monsters), and he has a quick temper. That said, there was never a Sim who loved doing laundry quite as much, he's great around adults, and he doesn't let interpersonal-relationship problems fester! Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of his life is that spoiled Kierra Tilo won't stop messaging him, and his beloved Brent Hong doesn't know he exists. Such is life!
On the surface, Daniel and Mary-Sue Pleasant seem to have the perfect life, but is their love a flimsy façade? And can Angela and Lilith make the right choices when it comes to love? Celebrate the 19th year of The Sims with the Pleasant Family.
Is that a Silver Dollar Pancake? Nope, it's just the newest little addition to Bob &amp; Eliza's pancake stack! Meet their son Iggy, a charming toddler who's bringing a small measure of harmony to the Pancakes' household.
Oh Ollie... He's always been a bit of a dreamer in life. His family worried he was destined to be destitute, his artistic talents going unrecognized. It turned out, he simply needed his muse. While nursing a drink in The Blue Velvet Nightclub one evening, he locked eyes with Babs—his life was never the same again. A whirlwind romance with Babs led to marriage and fatherhood; Ollie would never be called a starving artist again!
Bold and dynamic, Noah is all about using photography &amp; film to evoke emotion and get people talking. Both on and off set, he's happiest when he's calling the shots, or making people laugh. He will admit that he's maybe a little too obsessed with his Simstagram followers, but they've certainly helped expand his career. Witty, confident, and motivated by success, Noah can sometimes come across as having a little too much ego—but it's all in the name of his art.
Bob and Betty Newbie are back in a Sims 4 iteration of the family inspired by past Sims games. Celebrate the 19th year of The Sims with these classic characters.
Morgan is all-in, all the time. Driven by her life-long love of sport, Morgan believes life is meant to be lived, not spent behind a desk. She's always up for any adventure her friends suggest, and always pushes herself to do more. With her track and cross-country scholarships, she was always a top performing athlete at university. She's currently training for her first Iron Man competition, which means a lot of time in the pool and on a bike.
Sul, Sul! Here is the Sim of actress and trailblazer, Millie Bobby Brown!
With a head for numbers, and a creative eye, Mia splits her time between freelance programmer and artist gigs. Being both a bit of an introvert, and a bit of a rebel, this independence suited her outlook in life. Mia has a unique way of attracting creative, high-energy friends like Noah, and her girlfriend Dela. They love her genuine, almost kid-like enthusiasm. She is the glue that bonds her social circles together.
Marco is a painter who has never really known what he wants in life. What he does know is that he's happy with a brush in his hand and a cup of coffee at his side. More than anything he likes painting people. Wrinkley Sims, round Sims, youthful Sims, Sims with no hair, Sims with blue hair! He believes distinctions are what make Sims so beautiful, and he wants to capture every small detail.
Celebrate the Lunar New Year and Year of the Pig with the Zhao family!
Some Sims dream of being a master chef, but not Li Loh. He wants to master the Art of Mixology. Dazzle patrons near and far with fantastical drinks, bizarre concoctions, and gift them with the art of his moves. He's spent years studying, traveled around the world experiencing the drinks of different cultures, and he's ready. Oh, he's ready.
Lacey's parents frequently tell her she needs to grow up. She's teetering on the brink between party girl and socialite, has distinctly different social groups in each category, and hasn't committed to either path yet. To keep this double life in check, she calls herself Stacey whenever she's attending a highbrow affair.
Kurt comes from an impressive lineage of lumberjacks. While forestry is in his blood, his real passion lies in apiculture (or Beekeeping)! Kurt loves his little bumblies. He even tried to make a shop selling bee products called Kurt's Bees–which didn't go over super well. As long as he's stuck in Granite Falls, he knows he will never get out of the family business, so Kurt is off on an adventure, beyond his comfort zone, to chase his dreams!
Kierra is your average-run-of-the-mill-heiress who grew up in a beach-mansion. It's hard being Kierra! She's has always had to wonder if people don't just like her because of her money, or her hot tub, or her hair. It -is- fabulous! Occasionally, she likes to dress down and pretend to be 'normal.' It doesn't help that her crush Ross Valentin snubs her whenever he gets the chance. He's the only guy that's never been interested!
Quirky, creative, a hopeless romantic... Kat is a sweetheart who has aspirations to chase a career in fashion. Her dark secret: She's obsessed with dinosaurs and other buried secrets. While part of her would like to give up fashion and pursue archaeology, it's a little out of her comfort zone. For now, she's content to collect as many dino-curios and fossils as she can and display them around the house... or is she?
There are those who might say Kasen is a bit materialistic... He'd say he has good taste (but let's face it, they wouldn't be wrong). Designer shirt §300 Simoleons. Designer Glasses: §450 Simoleons. His haircut: §200 Simoleons. Maybe someday he will achieve his goals of becoming a famous DJ, but for now... he's glad to just look good.
A bit of a flirt, Kaiden is a sweetie looking for genuine connections. He's easily likeable and not afraid to show off his silly side. Kaiden's biggest flaw: he's a little too obsessed with Thorne Bailey's music. (It horrifies his friends when he shows up dressed like Thorne to parties.) Even still, Kaiden hopes he can overcome his timidity and make it big in the entertainment business just like his role-model.
Kai doesn't need a weight bench to workout—the world is his gym. Whether he's jogging, swimming, or competing in sports, he's never not moving. His questionable sense of social cues has yet to hold him back in life; case in point—he doesn't receive pushback (or complaints) despite his proclivity to walk around shirtless. His physique is practically a walking billboard for his side hustle of mentoring other Sims in their exercise regimens.
Nothing will deter June from accomplishing her goals in life, even if they are a bit erratic. She once got WAY into woodworking... random, right? But she followed through; months of hard work in the gym built the muscles she needed to carve every piece of furniture in her home from a solid oak tree. Something else she realized she wanted was Steve Fogel—they're an odd couple, but ambition is a trait this pair will never find themselves short of.
Jayden is a personal trainer, with an easy and charming approach to life. Starting in childhood, he found camaraderie through sports, and satisfaction through challenging himself to do his best in any physical feat. Ultimately, that's what drew him to his work as a personal trainer. Always curious and down for anything, Jayden's mellow attitude is a great complement to his girlfriend, Zoe—a feisty, outgoing professional dancer.
Big hearted and expressive, Hunter is an outspoken activist for the LGBTQIA community; he's passionate about creating space for people to come together and feel supported. He's cultivated a huge social media following, and his followers count on him to document every moment for the world to see. When he's not authoring content for his channel, he partners with his bestie Camille on a nutrition and wellness series.
Holly likes to daydream about becoming a famous country singer, but in reality she's a down home southern girl. From sun up to sun set, you'll find her in the great outdoors—typically with a fishing rod in hand.
The Grunts from Sims 2 Strangetown are back! Tank has always lived under the hard thumb of his father, Grand Marshal Buzz Grunt. In this domesticated boot camp, can Tank prove his worth to this demanding dad? How will Ripp and Buck fair in a family not quite their 'style'? Celebrate the 19th year of The Sims with these classic characters.
George is a buttoned up kind of guy. He keeps his head down, works hard, and wants the world to recognize his vast array of skills. At home though, it's a different story. That's when any noble pursuits get cast aside in favor of junk food and video games. His darkest secret? He keeps voodoo dolls of his friends, observes them from afar, and waits for the perfect opportunity to torment them. His second darkest secret? He wishes he was a cowboy. 
Gael is a bit clumsy and kind of messy, but he always has the best intentions! So what if he accidentally set his sister's beloved bowler on fire three times? Those things are ridiculously flammable! He thinks his twin sister, Gabby, and her friends are the best, so he regularly tags along—even if they don't have a lot in common. Deep down, what he really wants is to meet a group of buds to watch the next big game together.
Something of a hipster, Gabby changed her name when 'Gabriela' became the new baby name sensation of the year. She loves going to festivals with friends! Unfortunately, her twin brother Gael regularly tags along, trying to fit in. It's weird, but she loves him. Though she used to be uptight... years of taking care of Gael's messes have mellowed Gabby, and now she'd rather spend a chill evening, listening to the best undiscovered artists.
Erroll fancies himself a musician, but he really needs a manager to provide better direction to his career. In his last get-famous-quick scheme, he applied to a reality music competition. When he lost in the final episode, his star faded. Ultimately, people just don't remember second place. Ever since then he's overhauled his wardrobe to dress himself just like the producers did on the show, hoping to be recognized around town. Sadly, nobody has yet.
To Emiko, duality is a lifestyle. She's both cutesy and rebellious. Sweet and tough. Her pastimes include: playing with dolls, doing makeup tutorials online, chasing the Flower Bunny (who she adores), and throwing the best parties. Technology is an important aspect of Emiko's life, especially since her childhood best friend, Valeria Lopez, moved away from Japan at a young age. It's allowed them to keep in touch.
As a kid, Dela lived all over the world, shadowing her mum-a globally sought-after fashion photographer. That experience gave Dela an inherent sense of optimism and a deep entrepreneurial spirit. She recently launched her first fashion line, and her unique pieces and global style is starting to get press. Her girlfriend Mia-a designer in her own right-helps keep her informed of trends outside the fashion industry.
From a young age, it was obvious that Cassidy would blossom as a musical prodigy. She would fight with her brother, Ollie, over her need to diligently practice the piano—Ollie just wanted a quiet home to draw in. As a teen, she took up the guitar and quickly mastered that as well. To Cassidy, technology is a bore... She'd much rather spend an afternoon exploring a vintage record store.

This Sim has enough Character Values to receive this Trait when aging up to Young Adult:
Upon aging up to Young Adult, this Sim can earn one of the following Traits:
Character Values
Character Values determine a Sim's ability to adapt and behave effectively in everyday life. Each value can be positive or negative.\n\nHover over each of the Values below to view interactions that the child can do to influence Character Values. Parents can also influence these values by using Parenting Interactions.
Explore the Ghost Mastery panel to track progress, stamina, and access the perks panel. Ghost Mastery is categorized into Evil, Neutral, and Good, shaping the type of ghost a Sim can become. Hover over each ability in the perks panel to learn more.\n\nGhosts use stamina when performing abilities. As stamina depletes, ghosts will appear more faded, which can be monitored using the stamina meter.\n\nTo reset unlocked abilities, visit the the Well of Longing and Regret in Crow's Crossing neighborhood of Ravenwood at anytime.&#xD;&#xA;

Fame Points:
Staying Out of the Spotlight
Fame Info
A Sim's Public Image is comprised of &lt;i&gt;Reputation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Celebrity Level&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nReputation is what others think of them, and can be changed by doing certain behaviors while being observed by others.\n\nCelebrity Level measures how famous they are, and can be increased by performing actions that gain fame. Attaining levels gain Fame Points, which can be spent in the Fame Info Panel to unlock new Fame Perks. The panel may also be used to opt a Sim out of fame gain entirely.
Public Image
Celebrity Level Lost
{0.SimName} has lost fame and is now a {1.String}.
Batuu Reputation
This panel displays your Sims reputation with the 3 factions of Batuu. Scoundrel Reputation can be gained and lost independently of the other 2 factions. However, Resistance and First Order cannot be gained without losing reputation in the other. Hover over each reputation bar to see what the next level will provide your Sim.

The Repeal Process
Start the Repeal process on an active N.A.P. by selecting &lt;i&gt;Petition for Repeal&lt;/i&gt; from a public Voting Board or Mailbox. Sims must gather enough repeal signatures from their neighbors to successfully repeal an Action Plan. If enough signatures are collected, the Action Plan will be repealed once voting closes for that period.
Currently Repealing:
{0.Number}/{1.Number}
None
Influence Points:
While the voting period is open, Sims can vote on Neighborhood Action Plans and Community Space Projects to make an impact on their neighborhood.\n\nSims can vote at either their &lt;b&gt;Mailbox&lt;/b&gt; or a &lt;b&gt;Community Voting Board&lt;/b&gt; placed at any Venue. Sims who live in Evergreen Harbor can also use the &lt;b&gt;Community Voting Board&lt;/b&gt; that's out in their neighborhood.\n\nVoting requires &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;. Sims can get &lt;i&gt;Influence Points&lt;/i&gt; by following behaviors promoted by enacted Neighborhood Action Plans, by making new friends, and by being an overall stand-up member of their community.

Sims can earn Mastery Perks when using skills at high levels. With their life experience, elders are more likely to discover them; however, any Sim can get a perk with persistent practice. Receiving mentoring and attending Hobby Classes helps as well.\n\nFor a more direct approach, elders can Bestow their perks upon other Sims. Mastery Perk Bestower and Remover Potions can also be purchased in the Reward Store.

Items that support Off-the-Grid gameplay can be found in their own Off-the-Grid category in Build Mode. This section can be accessed within the Objects by Function drop down.\n\nAnywhere within Build Mode, Water and Power objects that have unique Off-the-Grid functionality are marked with a “Functional Off-the-Grid” tooltip note when you hover over them.
To apply the Off-the-Grid Lot Trait go into Build Mode and click on the Venue Info button in the top left corner. Open the Traits Panel from the pop-up menu. Then, click on the Off-the-Grid icon to slot it into your active lot. 
When Power or Water utility is acquired as a surplus on an Off-the-Grid lot, Water and Power objects will function normally again.\n\nWhen this happens, a new interaction will appear on Functional Off-the-Grid objects to Turn On/Off Utility Usage. Toggling this option allows the player to determine which objects will pull from the excess utility and which will solely retain their Off-the-Grid functionality. 
The Off-the-Grid Lot Trait disconnects a lot from the utility grid. Most objects that require Power or Water will not work, supporting interesting new story themes and challenging gameplay elements. 
Playing on an Off-the-Grid lot means access to new gameplay elements!\n\n• Click on a grill or Off-the-Grid supported oven to view exclusive recipes. Some require ingredients and provide powerful moodlets.\n• Water utility can be collected from various locations around the world.\n• Functional Off-the-Grid objects have unique interactions that allow them to fulfill needs.\n• Add Ice to supported Fridges. Just be sure to replace the ice before it melts!\n• Bills on Off-the-Grid lots do not charge for Water or Power utility. They also provide a Tax Break discount!

Lot Challenges
You can change the Lot Challenges in the Venue Info panel in Build Mode. We've moved some classic Lot Traits such as Off-the-Grid to a new section of this panel dedicated to challenges. Check them out by clicking on the trophy.
Lot Challenges change up the experience of playing on a lot, adding an element of difficulty. The challenges are stackable so you can mix and match to cater to how you want to play. Apply as many Lot Challenges as you want and share your favorite combinations with other players when you upload the lots to the Gallery.
Fishing Skill
Increasing your Fishing skill will unlock Fish with Bait and increase the likelihood of catching bigger and better fish.\n\nProTip: There are some fish only found in hidden locations.
Fishing Holes can be found all over the world. Click on the Fishing Hole and begin Fishing to raise your Fishing skill.\n\nFishing skill is also improved by Fishing, and Reading about Fishing.
Fears
Every time your Sim wakes up while having a Fear, they will have a chance to get a confrontation goal to appear. Helping your Sim complete this confrontation goal will help them overcome their Fear. Some Fears may take multiple confrontations in order to be fully removed.\n\nWhen your Sim overcomes their Fear they will become proud of what they did and the Fear will be removed from their traits! \n\nYou can also purchase a &quot;Fear-Be-Gone&quot; potion from the Reward Store to quickly remove a Fear that your Sim has gained.
With Wants making a comeback, so are Fears: \n\nFears are traits that your Sim may obtain through gameplay. Sound a bit vague? \n\nHere is an example of a possible Fear that your Sim may get! Let's just say for some reason your Sim caught on fire and survived. Well, that can be quite terrifying and your Sim will most likely gain a Fear of fire.\n\nThere are numerous ways of getting a Fear on your sim and each one will have an interesting effect on how your Sim behaves in the world. Be careful! Sims are not limited to just one Fear at a time.
What are the consequences of having a Fear trait on your Sim? Well, it will depend on what Fear your Sim gets. Fears will come with permanent negative effects until your Sim is ready to overcome them. The effects will vary and are not limited to: negative moodlets appearing, higher chances of failing interactions, and some changes to their behavior in certain situations.\n\nThat sounds awful! Don't worry, Fears are meant to be overcome! It may take some time and hard work, but you can help your Sim overcome their Fear when the time is right!
Environment Effects
Some decorative items will affect your Sim's current emotion. For example, if a painting is inspiring, have your Sim view the painting to become inspired.\n\nNote: An objects catalog hovertip will inform you if it will have an emotional impact on your Sims.
Sims are affected negatively by things like dirty dishes, broken household items, and puddles. 
Experiment by designing rooms in your Sims' homes to improve their moods when creating, exercising, and more!
Groups
You can start a Group by selecting another Sim, selecting Actions, and Add to Group. Disbanding the Group or Removing Sims from the Group can also be found in Actions.
Groups will automatically be formed when you travel with other Sims, or Invite them over to the current lot. Dates will also form an exclusive Group for the duration of the date!
Sims love to do things together, and what better way than to do them in a Group? Group behavior is much easier to control and more visible than ever.
Sims in a Group will be represented by a clear Icon over their head. You can have up to eight Sims in a Group.
Death
Upon death: the Grim Reaper comes to usher them from the game, leaving behind a memorial Urn or Gravestone which nearby Sims can use to mourn.
Sims can die if their Needs are neglected for too long, if they push their Sims too far down an emotional path, or as the result of failing certain risky interactions.\n\nOr fire. Fire can kill too. Yep, fire.\n\nI mentioned fire, right?
Dying isn’t the end! When Sims meet their untimely (or timely) demise, a Sim can begin a new chapter by becoming a Ghost.\n\nBy choosing &lt;b&gt;Become a Playable Ghost&lt;/b&gt;, the Sim will remain in the Household and continue to be playable as a Ghostly presence.\nChoose &lt;b&gt;Become a Freeroaming Ghost&lt;/b&gt; if you would prefer this Sim &lt;i&gt;live on&lt;/i&gt; as a Ghost in an unplayed Household. These Sims will no longer be a played Sim but can still be found in the World.
Plan Outfit will take you to Create a Sim, however you will not be able to edit some parts of your Sims.\n\nYou can modify Outfits, Accessories, as well as Hair.
Outfit Planning
When you are done modifying your Sims, click the Play button to return to Live Mode.
Body &amp; Facial Modifications are off limits.\n\nThe Muscle and Fat sliders in Create a Sim update based on your Sims experiences, you can see how your Sims are doing.
Click on your Sim or a Dresser and choose Change Outfit... to change the outfit your Sim is currently wearing.\n\nTo modify the outfits, click on a Dresser and choose Plan Outfit.
Changing Outfits
Sims will &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; their Outfits to suit different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;situations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, such as wearing their Swimwear when going in the pool, but you can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; their current Outfit yourself. This is great for storytelling and screenshots!\n\nIf your Sim has aged up and you’re not a fan of their new clothes, or you’re just looking for some change, you can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;customize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s available Outfits.
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s current Outfit, either click on the Sim themselves and choose Outfits &gt; Change Outfits, or interact with a mirror and choose Change Outfits.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;customize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s Outfits, interact with a mirror or dresser and choose Change Sim. This will open Create a Sim. When customizing an already existing Sim, you can change things like their clothes and hair, but not sculpt their face and body, or change their Traits.
Careers
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Business app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on your phone has a lot of useful functionality. Here you’ll find options to take a vacation day, quit, or get a new job.\n\nOnce your Sim becomes an Elder, you can use the Business App to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;retire&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. They will get a pension every day, based on their salary. Freedom at last!
Once your Sim has a Career, you can find everything you need to know in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nThe top half lists your title, salary, schedule, and available vacation days. The bottom half lists your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Promotion Requirements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Having a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is one of the best ways to make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! The starting salary can be a bit on the low side, but when you climb the career ladder you can make big bucks.\n\nAdvancing in Careers will also unlock unique Objects and Clothes, and allows your Sim to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;retire&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and get a pension upon becoming an Elder.
Your Sim can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;join a Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by using the Business app on their phone, or by opening the Career panel selecting Join a Career.\n\nCareer &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;success&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; depends on different Skills. It’s a good idea to base your choice on your Sim’s current skills, or any Traits that help them build Skills. But with hard work, any Sim can succeed in any Career!
Let’s talk about &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;promotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Promotions mean new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and better &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;salaries&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. To get promoted, you need to fill the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Performance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; bar and fulfill any &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Requirements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (usually reaching specific Skill levels).\n\nThe best ways to increase your Performance are completing your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Daily Tasks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and going to work with a positive &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nWhile they’re at work, you can also select the Away Action icon on Sim’s thumbnail and order them to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Work Hard&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for an extra boost!
Bugs
We apologize if you find a bug. We hope that you can forgive us for not finding it ourselves.
What is a bug? Everything from a software crash, a freeze, or a memory leak; to grammatical errors, missing user interface data, and clipping.
Software has bugs. The etymology of the term &quot;bug&quot; is greatly debated, although it is an accepted fact that it predates software.
Moodlets
Each Moodlet has an emotion strength associated with it.  Your Sim determines their current Emotion based on the Moodlets they have.
Interactions in the game can push different Moodlets upon your Sims. Brush your teeth, and you might be feeling Minty Fresh. Neglect your hygiene, and you might be Grungy.
Some Moodlets will be multi-colored, these are Happy Emotion Moodlets, or Bonus Moodlets. If you are currently in any Emotion other than Happy, Bonus Moodlets will enhance your current Emotion.\n\nNote: Hover over your Moodlets to see their effect, how you got them, and what Emotion they are boosting.
Your Sims are emotional beings. And their Moodlets drive their emotions.
Bonfire
The Bonfire allows Sims to hang out with friends or cozy up next to that special someone. It'll burn bright and colorfully!
Find all the secrets that the bonfire holds! Sims with high mischief can use the voodoo doll to mess with other Sims. Having a ghost possess it can also be a sight to behold.
Try burning different things in the bonfire! You can live drag objects in the Sim's inventory to experiment. Sims with traits may even react to what's being burnt!
Aging &amp; Birthdays
Any cake can be a Birthday Cake.\n\nBake a cake, click on it and choose Add Birthday Candles.
You can also use the Birthday Cake to age up your friends and neighbors, just in case you want them to always be the same age as you.
When your Sim is ready for the big moment, have them Blow Out the candles on their Birthday Cake and watch them transition to their next set of life experiences!
Negative Emotions
Negative emotions should be seen as a challenge and a goal to solve. Experiment as your Sims cruise the emotional landscape!
New interactions become available and others disappear based on your Sims' emotions.
Negative Emotions like Sadness and Anger will change your Sim's behavior and outlook on life. At least temporarily.
When your Sim is in a negative Emotion, you can help them recover\n\nThe Emotional Whim can always help you find a way to deal with your emotions.
Baby Care
Be sure to bottle or breast feed babies to provide nourishment.
Babies will need to be cleaned often as well as they aren't yet potty trained.
And don't forget, give babies plenty of love!
Aspirations
Achievements
Achievements are goals for you to work towards across multiple households and save files (Achievements are saved per EA Account).\n\nNote: In some cases, you will be unable to gain an Achievement by playing only one household.
You can also use the Achievements tracker to help guide you in your exploration of The Sims 4.  Maybe you'll find out something you didn't know existed in the game by reading the Achievement goal.
To view all of your Achievements, enter Live Mode, open the Options Menu, and choose Achievements from the menu.
Scenarios
You can start a new Scenario from the Main Menu. When choosing a Scenario you will be able to start a scenario with new, existing, and pre-made households. Some Scenarios will have options to start with new or existing households, while some will require either a new or premade household.\n\nPre-made household scenarios will be indicated in red text on the Scenarios menu.
Scenarios put your household in an interesting situation with some initial setup and long-term goals for Live Mode. Completing these goals will progress you through the Scenario to an outcome and reward your Sims!\n\nMore types of Scenarios will be added over time, so check back periodically for new, updated, or limited-time Scenarios.
The Bassinet is an essential object expecting parents should purchase for their newborn.\n\nIf you don't purchase a bassinet, don't worry, your baby will still arrive in their very own (or maybe two if you have twins!).
So, you want to know if you are having a baby... your Sim can take a Pregnancy test by interacting on the toilet to really be sure, or, you can just wait to see what happens.
When your Sim's pregnancy is at an end, the baby will be born. Be ready at any moment! Your Sim will receive a Birth Certificate that you can place on the wall!
Pregnant Sims will have adjusted physical needs and Emotions. It may get rocky at times, but it's worth the effort!
Neighborhood Stories Settings
To configure custom settings for all Sim households in the tab, select the top right icon. Remember that My Households and Other Households have separate settings. Sim households that move from one tab to the other will only be affected by Neighborhood Stories settings for their current tab location. You may wish to configure custom Neighborhood Stories settings for Sim households you do not want to undergo independent life changes.\n\nTo configure custom settings for individual Sim households, select the left icon at the bottom of each household.
To see Notifications of what life changes have taken place recently, enter Live Mode and go to a Mailbox, then select Check Recent Neighborhood Stories. Visit a Neighbor Sim to check in on them as their lives change and develop over time!
Select either My Households to configure households you've played, or Other Households to configure households you haven't played. By default, Neighborhood Stories is only enabled for Other Households, with all types of life changes allowed. 
Once you select the Neighborhood Stories configuration button, you can toggle on or off each type life change. Click the check button to confirm changes.
Neighborhood Stories can be quickly configured for all Households and/or individually per Household. Select Manage Worlds in the Options Menu, then select Manage Households.
Neighborhood Stories Life Changes
Neighborhood Stories allows Neighbor Sims and Households that you aren't actively playing to experience life changes. There are various types of life changes that can occur, as long as the given life change is enabled in Neighborhood Stories settings under Manage Households.
Neighbor Sims can also join and leave careers, with some Elder Sims choosing to retire. 
Neighbor Sims can expand their families by becoming pregnant or adopting young Sims. If your active Household is friendly with the Neighbor Sims, they may get a call to announce the new additions to the household.
Neighbor Sims may even die before their time. While unfortunate, accidents happen! You may want to visit the family of a deceased Sim to offer them condolences.
Neighbor Sims may move in or out of Lots in the world. The lot must be set as Residential with enough beds for Sims to sleep in. Build your own houses or download houses from the Gallery for Neighbor Sims to occupy.
Social
In a pinch, call a Sim or chat via the computer to fill your Sim's Social Need slightly.
Call a Sim over to your Sim's home or travel to a community lot (like the gym!) to meet Sims in person.
Sims require Sim-to-Sim interaction, else they go a little crazy.
Sims will take care of their Social Need on their own if you let them and they are able to do so!
Hygiene
Washing your hands via the sink is only a temporary solution, but every bit helps!
Hygienic Sims will be happier and more successful socially.
Sims require the occasional splash of water on their skin. Try taking a Bath or Shower. 
Sims will take care of their Hygiene Need if you let them and they are able to do so!

Sims will take care of their Hunger Need if you let them and they are able to do so!

Sims can have fun playing games, reading, watching TV, and more!
Sims will take care of their Fun Need if you let them and they are able to do so!

Missing Grandmother
You know, perhaps it was best to keep a low profile. It would be stupid to antagonize the neighbors &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt;, right? That’s what Farrah is telling herself, at least…
You won... but at what cost?
Nova's rival is gone
Lewis Moved in with Nova
Kindness Ambassador
When two ambitious Sims combine forces, they can achieve great things. Encourage Nova and Lewis to grow their new-found relationship and support each other... or let them fall back into their old, bickering ways. Whatever you choose, with a pair like Nova and Lewis, drama will surely follow.  
They say the best way to defeat an enemy is to make them your friend. Nova went a bit further than that and made Lewis a part of her household. The day may come when she questions her decision to live with an insufferable know-it-all, but today, she's happy to have regained a long lost friendship. 
Lewis Sancho is dead.
Twisted Heart
Nova's journey continues as she learns to live with Lewis's death. She can climb the corporate ladder as she originally intended, or find a new path in life. 
Nova won the rivalry and her old childhood friend-turned-enemy is no more. Will she mourn the bond they once shared, or rejoice that her adversary will never insult her again? 
Nova Has it All
Quitting the Rat Race
Nova can proudly close the first chapter of her career… as a free woman! It felt &lt;i&gt;sooo&lt;/i&gt; good to call her manager and quit. She’s now rich in the world’s best currency: free time! It's up to you to decide what she'll invest it in!
Nova gave in to FOMO and embraced the indie life. She’s now free from the corporate chains, and yep, Lewis’ chaotic neutral energy &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; have had something to do with it.
Indie Power Couple
Nova could’ve been a brilliant indie dev on her own, but every hero needs a sidekick… or a side piece. These two are unstoppable together!
Fantastic Duo
Nova could’ve been a brilliant indie dev on her own, but every hero needs a sidekick, right? These two are unstoppable together!
Evil Plan
Yes, Nova will team up with Lewis… for now. It’s never too late to drop the weak link, or that’s what she keeps telling herself…
Pair Programming
Nova can proudly close the first chapter of her career… as the ultimate overachiever! Will she be able to strike a good work-life balance now she'll have so much on her plate? And what will she spend all of that nice passive income on? It's up to you to decide!
Nova landed her dream job &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; managed to work on her passion project too! That meant having to team up with Lewis though… Oh, well. 
Nova chose to program both in her job and in her free time, earning her the Webmaster trait. Webmasters get the most out of their computers, unlocking extremely useful ways to use them.
Not only Nova landed her dream job and worked on her passion project, but she also found love along the way! How she manages to juggle everything and still get some sleep is a mystery that remains to be solved.
We Stand United
Not only Nova landed her dream job and worked on her passion project, but she also managed to rekindle her friendship with Lewis! How she manages to juggle everything and still get some sleep is a mystery that remains to be solved.
To achieve everything, Nova has had very little sleep. That earned her the reward trait Seldom Sleepy, that greatly slows the decay rate of the Energy meter, allowing Nova to stay awake longer.
Keep your Enemies Closer
Nova kept her 9 to 5 job but was also eager to keep working on her passion project, so she figured that keeping Lewis around to do the dirty work couldn't be &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; bad...
Nova can't stand Lewis but still chose to keep him around, earning the reward trait Mastermind. Masterminds know just the right things to say to cause anger, sadness, and jealousy in their opponents.
Gaming Elite
Nova can proudly close the first chapter of her career. Now she’s competed against Lewis (and won!), she’s ready to compete against the rest of the world as a professional eSports Gamer! Will she find new nemeses or form strong alliances? It’s up to you to decide!
Single Player Only
Rival got Pwned!
Slow and Steady Wins the Race
Nova can proudly close the first chapter of her career. She’s now very much her own boss and launched her very own company, built on her very own ideals. Will she find new nemeses or form strong alliances? It’s up to you to decide!
Nova didn't have time to entertain Lewis' chaotic proposals. She was too busy succeeding at work and landing her dream job in the tech industry.
Don't Mix Business with Pleasure
Nova would do anything for love… but she won’t do that. She’d rather separate her work life from her personal life, and keep succeeding at both!
This Dev Flies Solo!
Nova won’t trip over the same stone twice, and working with Lewis again seemed like a recipe for disaster. She chose to work separately, although they remain good friends!
Ugh, As If!
Nova might have helped Lewis once, but she can't keep rescuing him every time! Just as Nova ended up landing her dream job, Lewis needs to figure his own life out. 
Dream Chaser
Nova can proudly close the first chapter of her career. She’s now working as a Low Orbit Specialist, but how high will she fly? Will Lewis and Nova continue competing in space, where no one can hear them scream? It’s up to you to decide!
Nova and Lewis may not see eye to eye sometimes, but credit where credit’s due: he made it up to her by getting her closer to her childhood dream of traveling through space.
Intergalactic Power Couple
Nothing is set in stone: Nova’s turned her enemy into her lover, and swapped cubicle boredom for adventures in space!
To Simfinity… and beyond!
Nothing is set in stone: Nova’s turned her enemy into a friend, and swapped cubicle boredom for adventures in space! 
Intergalactic Nemesis
Some things can change, like Nova’s role, that went from Developer to Low Orbit Specialist. Her rivalry with Lewis, however, is here to stay!
It takes a lot of courage to become an Astronaut! Nova gained the Brave trait which means she won't be easily frightened!
Haters Gonna Lose
Nova can proudly close the first chapter of her career. Now she’s competed against Lewis (and won!), she’s ready to compete against the rest of the world as a professional eSports Gamer! Will she find new nemeses or form strong alliances? And will she end up giving up on her dream to go to space? It’s up to you to decide!
Enemies to Lovers
Nova would follow Lewis anywhere… but space. She chose the adrenaline rush of competing in eSports Stadiums over going on galactic adventures.
Friendship Respawned
Nova became an eSports Gamer and decided to keep her feet on the ground… of planet Earth! Her newly rekindled friendship with Lewis wouldn’t survive the close quarters of a spaceship anyway…

The past leaves echoes in time which can be found once again. Discover them, and uncover their secrets. 
Quest Complete!
If time travel is indeed real, there must be a way to uncover its secrets.
Intuition drove the discovery of the time capsule and note inside.\n\nEmit believes the missing items are because of a time-traveling thief...which is a lot to absorb!
The mystery of missing items continues as the search uncovers secrets long buried.
A Sim from the past arrives in town with a boom and flash of light. Meet them, and find out what's going on.
Quest Complete!
The quest continues as new clues appear.

In the Weeds
Crouching on the ground with worms and dirt? No thank you. {0.SimFirstName} is not reaping whatever it is that {M0.he}{F0.she} is sowing. Is it time to admit that {M0.he}{F0.she} &lt;b&gt;Dislikes Gardening&lt;/b&gt;?

It is both now and ever, long and short, and started when someone tried to fix past mistakes.

It was once a safe haven for those intent on avoiding the expanding reach of the First Order, but the struggle between the First Order and the Resistance has made it's way to Batuu.

The Choripán as a name comes from the combination of the names of its ingredients: a grilled chorizo sausage and a crusty bread (in Spanish called pan) such as a baguette, or francés. For some it might be just a sandwich, but it is more than that... it is almost part of the culinary identity for various countries in South America, specially Argentina. Commonly served during an Asado and street vendors, Choripanes have become one of the most sought out street food.

Asado for some is a technique, but it can also be an event in itself when it comes to barbeque in various South American countries. An asado usually consists of beef, pork, chicken, chorizo, and morcilla which are cooked on a grill, or an open fire. A personal favorite is some beef and Guasacaca (an avocado based sauce from Venezuela). Buen provecho!

Challah is a type of bread often baked for Jewish celebrations such as Shabbat. Typically, challah is prepared in a way that's pareve in that it doesn't combine dairy products with egg. The bread loaves are braided and, on Rosh Hashanah, are often presented in a round &quot;turban&quot; form. On Shabbat, two loaves of challah are covered with a cloth that can be rather elaborately embroidered or decorated and Kiddush blessings are recited before the bread is sliced and eaten.\n\nDepending upon the occasion, challah may be served sprinkled with salt or with honey and in some cultures raisins, dates, or other ingredients may even be added! No matter how you slice it, this rich and eggy bread is a delicious treat that helps unite people all around the world.\n\nVegetarian-Safe, Lactose Free

Place the seeds on the ground or in a Planter and choose to Plant {1.Number} Plants. Care for the plants as they grow to keep them alive.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI'm gonna get my green thumb! All I gotta do is have a bunch of living plants all at once. If they die it doesn't count! It'll take a lot of care, but I know I can do it!
&quot;I'm going to have at least 5 plants at once...but they all have to be alive or it doesn't count.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Catch {1.Number} Rare Fish. Tip: The higher {0.SimFirstName}'s Fishing Skill is the better chance {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.has}{P0.have} of catching Rare Fish.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI've always heard that there are a lot of fish in the sea! Well, I'm going to catch some. But not just any! I'm going to catch some really rare fish! At least {1.Number} rare fish!
&quot;I want to catch the rarest, most hardest to catch fish that ever existed!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;When it is Hot or Cold go outside in unsuitable clothing or stand near objects that will make {0.SimFirstName} hotter or colder. Have {0.SimPronounObjective} become dangerously hot or cold. (But don't die!)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nDid you know some Sims freeze into icicles or burst into flames!? Well, that's not going to be me! I'm going to risk it, and get either super hot or super cold, and I'm going to withstand it! They'll call me Danger Kid!
&quot;If I can withstand extreme temperatures I'll prove how risky and wild I really am!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Eat Spoiled Food to become Nauseous {1.Number} times. Then tough it out!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nOkay, so spoiled food is pretty gross. Yuck! But if I eat it, then I'll get nauseous. And if I can tough that out, then I'll &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; I'm the toughest, riskiest kid ever! Nothing scares me!
&quot;I'd be so tough if I ate spoiled food! I bet I can do it {1.Number} times!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Earn a positive Sentiment with a Ghost by interacting with them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nGhosts are part of the past! I don't want to just meet one... I want to have a really special bond with one. I want to be special to the Ghost!
&quot;I want to have a really special connection with a Ghost!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Befriend a Ghost.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nGhost lived a long time ago! That means they must know a lot about what happened in the past. If I want to learn about the past, a Ghost is the perfect Sim to teach me! If I became friends with one I bet they'd tell me all about it!
&quot;Ghosts know &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; about the past. I bet if I made friends with one, I'd learn a lot about it too!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Collect {1.Number} nature-related collectibles. These include: Fossils, Elements, Metals, and more! Then select them to Study.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nIf I'm going to be a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; scientist then I need to study the world around me! I can do that with a collection! Which one should I start with?
&quot;I need to collect at least {1.Number} science thingies to study! It's called research!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Craft {1.Number} Potions successfully on the Science Table. Potions unlock beginning at Level 4 Mental Skill.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nLet me get my vials and micrascope and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;POOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;—mix up a real fancy potion or two! If I make a potion, I'm one-hundred-bazillion percent a scientist!
&quot;Muahaha! I'm gonna create some &lt;i&gt;strange&lt;/i&gt; science potions!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Swim for {1.Number} Hours.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI didn't know they had swimming back then! I bet I could be just like them if I practiced my swimming. I can't hold my breath very long, so I'll have to work up to be as good as they were in that scrapbook!
&quot;That Swim Team Scrapbook was so neat! I bet I can swim that much too!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Create {1.Number} Drawings on an Activity Table.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThat scrapbook was so neat! I want to be an artist like that someday! But you know what they say? Practice makes perfect! If I want to be that good...I'm going to have a lot of art to do.
&quot;I'm going to create my own art! Just like the sketches I found in that scrapbook!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Practice and Play Songs on an Instrument for {1.Number} hours.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI want to be a musician just like those Sims in that scrapbook! It's going to take a lot of practice, but I can do it! I just need an instrument. &lt;i&gt;I hope nobody minds the noise...&lt;/i&gt;
&quot;I'm going to get really good at playing music so I can be like the Sims from that scrapbook!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Use a Microwave or Fridge to Have a Quick Meal or Drink {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThere are safe, adult-approved ways I can make my own meals! (Really, I'm just not supposed to use the oven...) So I'm going to do some of those! If I do it enough, that'll prove that I really can feed myself!
&quot;I'm going to make my own food {1.Number} times all by myself! That'll prove I can do it.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Have a Teen or older Sim choose to Cook Together with {0.SimFirstName} {1.Number} of times. This can be done on Counters, Ovens, or Fridges.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nGrown-ups know a lot about cooking. If I'm going to get good at it, then I can probably learn a lot from them. Plus, that's &lt;i&gt;probably&lt;/i&gt; a lot safer...
&quot;If I'm going to learn to feed myself, I should probably cook with someone older than me first. To learn.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Collect {1.Number} nature-related collectibles. These include Frogs, Insects, and Butterflies.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI don't even know how many frogs and bugs there are out there? Probably &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt;. If I'm going to be all about nature, then I better challenge myself to start a collection and find some! It's a great idea!
&quot;Nature is all around. I'm going to discover as much as I can and start a collection!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Go into Create a Sim and set this Sim's Color Preferences. These can also be discovered by talking to other Sims about colors or by getting Nails done at a Spa (&lt;i&gt;Spa Day&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nSo I know my colors...but what color are the best colors? What colors make &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;pop&lt;/b&gt;? I've got some serious figuring out to do.
&quot;What colors do I love and what colors do I hate? Need to figure that out!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Select {0.SimFirstName}, a Dresser, Mirror, or similar objects to Plan or Change Outfit {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nWhat's the point in designing the most fashionable, most &lt;i&gt;artistic&lt;/i&gt; fashions if nobody ever sees them?! I need to show off a lot of different styles for &lt;i&gt;my brand&lt;/i&gt; to start spreading awareness.
&quot;I need to be seen around in my &lt;i&gt;amaaazing&lt;/i&gt; outfits.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Use a Dresser or Mirror to Plan Outfit.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI have so many outfit ideas! I bet if the world saw what I can do, my looks would be &lt;i&gt;super trendy&lt;/i&gt; in no time! They just need the 'me' touch!
&quot;I'm going to plan the coolest, most stylish outfit there ever was!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Take Out the Trash or Clean Dirty Dishes {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nHelping out around the house and cleaning up are some of the best ways to be useful! Everyone needs to do their share, and I know I will! That's for sure!
&quot;I can show how useful I am by helping out and cleaning up!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Play games on the Video Game Console and emerge victorious {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThe best way to prove that you're good at something is to win! So if I game and win, then I'm good at it! But it can't be just once. That could be a fluke!
&quot;To be good at gaming, I need to prove it and win at least {1.Number} games on a gaming console.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Listen to Music on Stereos or Radios to gain a Preference for {0.SimFirstName}.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThere's lots of good music out there, but what kind is &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; favorite? I guess I have to figure that out still. I should listen to some stuff and see what sticks!
&quot;So... what kind of music do I even like? I need to figure that out first.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Craft and sell items to earn Simoleons.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nA good, proper business Sim needs a solid business idea. That's the number one rule! Maybe I could make something and sell it?! Yeah, that'd be a good business idea!
&quot;I bet I can earn {1.Number} Simoleons! That'd prove I'm a successful business kid.&quot;

Share Findings about Forgotten Grotto
A forgotten grotto? It sounds like another wild goose chase. Stick to reality...
Incredible! It reminds me of the magic in Sylvan Glade. Hidden places hold such enchanting secrets!
Sounds far-fetched to me. Not every cave hides wonders. You're chasing shadows.
Fascinating! I've always believed there's more to explore beyond the surface. Maybe we can uncover more secrets together!

I believe you will be the next guardian of their legacy!&quot;\n\nWith that, the Envoy slips away once more, their departure raising suspicion.

According to this show...it's pretty typical to have found love at a nightclub; it seems like the ideal place that connects with music and love.

Dangerous Story
While researching a new story, {0.SimFirstName} gets the distinct impression {M0.he}{F0.she}’s being followed. While dying for a story would be good for {M0.his}{F0.her} legacy, {0.SimFirstName} would honestly rather not. Although {M0.he}{F0.she} feels like {M0.his}{F0.her} life is in danger, should {0.SimFirstName} keep digging, or back off?
Shocking Discovery
While researching {M0.his}{F0.her} next book, {0.SimFirstName} discovers something about a beloved historical figure that would shock the nation. If {M0.he}{F0.she} publishes it, {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes a legend, but it changes everything people thought they knew about history. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} publish it, or bury it?
News Show
In trying to promote {M0.his}{F0.her} latest book, {0.SimFirstName}’s publisher wants {0.SimPronounObjective} to appear on a news show with a host {M0.he}{F0.she} just can’t stand. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either grin and bear it on the program for the sake of sales, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can flat-out refuse.
Job Opening
There’s an opening for an opinion columnist on {0.SimFirstName}’s site. Readership has been falling, so {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to make sure to hire someone who will bring numbers up. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} hire a hot young writer who has big political opinions, or hire an experienced moderate?
A Fervent Wish
A sick little girl’s most fervent wish is to meet {0.SimFirstName}, her favorite author…and to find out what {0.SimFirstName}’s got planned for {M0.his}{F0.her} next book. Should {0.SimFirstName} share {M0.his}{F0.her} secrets, or stay tight-lipped?
Anonymous Source
One of {0.SimFirstName}’s stories draws the attention of the government, who wants the identity of {M0.his}{F0.her} anonymous source. They sound serious. {0.SimFirstName} can either divulge the source, even though {M0.he}{F0.she} promised them anonymity, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can keep quiet.
Out of Context
If {0.SimFirstName} takes a public figure’s statement just a little bit out of context, {M0.he}{F0.she}’ll get a great column out of it, even though {M0.he}{F0.she} knows it’s a stretch. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either run with it and hope {M0.his}{F0.her} readers agree with {0.SimPronounObjective}, or wait and hope that something more newsworthy comes along.
Terrible Assistant
{0.SimFirstName}’s terrible former assistant is claiming that he wrote huge portions of {0.SimFirstName}’s latest book. That assistant could barely get the coffee order right, but {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t want to be petty. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} tell the truth or say that the assistant “helped,” just to be nice?
An Awful Manuscript
The manuscript for the next volume in {0.SimFirstName}’s series is due soon…and it’s not exactly {M0.his}{F0.her} best work. In fact, it’s awful. Another writer has offered to help re-write it, as long as {0.SimFirstName} shares authoring credit. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either accept the help, or refuse it and publish the book with just {M0.his}{F0.her} own name on the cover.
Same Old Thing
Lately, all of {0.SimFirstName}’s stories have started to sound the same. They say variety is the spice of life, so maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could try mixing it up a bit. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try branching out into a new area of expertise, or just keep on doing the same thing? 
Political Endorsement
Whom should the paper endorse for political office? It’s {0.SimFirstName}’s call-she can either select the popular idealist who has no chance of winning, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can select the incumbent candidate who attends more fund-raisers and cocktail parties than meetings with constituents.
New Technology
{0.SimFirstName}’s publisher asks {0.SimPronounObjective} to release {M0.his}{F0.her} next book in a new electronic format-100 character bursts delivered every hour for 22 straight days. {M0.He}{F0.She}’d be the first author to do it! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} embrace the new technology, or stay with good old fashioned dead trees?
Although it was frightening, {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to get the story, and it’s a smash. Next {0.SimFirstName} will write the story of how {M0.he}{F0.she} GOT the story, which should be an even bigger smash!
{0.SimFirstName}’s assistant was so dumb he couldn’t put a sentence together…now that {0.SimFirstName} told the world, the assistant will probably never work again.
The source got in huge legal trouble, so now {0.SimFirstName} can’t find other people willing to talk to {M0.him}{F0.her} on the record! Plus, other writers are publicly shaming {M0.him}{F0.her} for not standing up for journalistic integrity. Was that still a thing?
Something will come along one day. And the one place where a writer shouldn’t make stuff up is on {M0.his}{F0.her} resume.
The backing of such a prestigious paper has put new life in the idealist’s campaign-she just might win after all! Probably not, really, but still! Hooray for principles!
The child is thrilled! She lights up when she hears {0.SimFirstName}’s stories in a way she hasn’t for weeks. Her parents are extremely grateful for {0.SimFirstName}’s kindness.
The host is a jerk, but appearing on TV will really juice sales-and now {0.SimFirstName} is even more well-known.
Hey, we’re all busy. The fan understands, and even a quick encounter with a celebrity is pretty exciting.
The other writer had some great ideas and did an excellent job rewriting. {0.SimFirstName} never could have done it alone.
{M0.His}{F0.Her} job isn’t to comment on history, just to provide the facts. The country is rocked. {0.SimFirstName}’s name will live on forever as a groundbreaking historian.
Readers love the quirky take on their local news. {0.SimFirstName} can even make parking court seem exciting!
{0.SimFirstName} writes an editorial that criticizes the incumbent for inaction. Readers appreciate it, and the politician vows to change.
Other writers applaud {0.SimFirstName} for taking a principled stand. The source is grateful for {M0.his}{F0.her} courage. Word spreads quickly and before long the requests for the source seem to have stopped. Everyone wishes there were more honorable reporters just like {0.SimName}.
All the assistant wanted was a little recognition. {0.SimFirstName} is considered generous and kind for acknowledging his contributions. 
Just a few hours after {0.SimFirstName} passes on the first column, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets an even better idea and writes a column {M0.he}{F0.she}’s proud of.
The manuscript's contents are just generic enough to rip without concern. {0.SimFirstName}'s publisher likes the changes and gives {F0.her}{M0.him} a thumbs-up.
Typical-it was a false alarm. Nothing happened, and all that time waiting was time {0.SimFirstName} could have spent writing!
Another author took the opportunity {0.SimFirstName} passed up, and is being hailed as the savior of the publishing industry. That was fast!
Sometimes it’s more important to let people have their illusions.{0.SimFirstName} can’t change what happened 200 years ago, so {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves it alone. Only {M0.he}{F0.she} knows the truth.
The little girl is obviously disappointed. Maybe if {0.SimFirstName} had given her something special to look forward to, she could have held on for a few more - nah, just kidding, she’s fine. She is really disappointed, though.
Readers agree, and even other writers praise {0.SimFirstName} for {M0.his}{F0.her} keen insight. {M0.His}{F0.Her} column is so successful, it’s all anyone’s talking about!
A writer selling a book needs all the help {M0.he}{F0.she} can get, and now {0.SimFirstName}’s publisher thinks {M0.he}{F0.she}’s difficult to work with.
Their Co-worker, on the other hand, gets a promotion for what turned out to be a seminal piece of literature. If only…
It turns out that readers don’t care what {M0.he}{F0.she} thinks about anything other than {M0.his}{F0.her} specialty. There’s no backlash like fan backlash!
{0.SimFirstName} knows when to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} losses. Unfortunately, flaky companies are part of the joy of freelance work. Better to just get some work done for a more reliable employer!
The book is selling really well. Sure, everything will be digital eventually, but that just means a lot of people want to enjoy real books while they still can.
Readers really loved {0.SimFirstName}’s unique perspective on a new topic.
The fan is so appreciative, and it turns out he runs one of the larger {0.SimName} fan sites. He promises to tell everyone about how nice {0.SimFirstName} was. This should do wonders for {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation!
Readers see right through that move, and many are moving on to reading other sites. Traffic is down lower than before!
Sometimes it’s more important to let people have their illusions…{0.SimFirstName} can’t change what happened 200 years ago, so {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves it alone. Only {M0.he}{F0.she} knows the truth.
The new writer makes the site seem more credible and unbiased, and traffic is up slightly, too. Other editors praise {0.SimFirstName} for raising the level of discourse in the news.
Suddenly, {0.SimFirstName} seems so much more qualified-on paper, anyway. Hope nobody checks those references…
Sure enough, the news event happened. Luckily, {0.SimFirstName} was ready and wrote a story ASAP, so {M0.his}{F0.her} site had the first exclusive.
The latest book in {0.SimFirstName}’s series is a hot mess, and goes straight to the bargain bin. Longtime fans of the franchise are outraged!
The new “burst” publishing method is inconvenient, confusing, and takes forever. But it’s new so people love it! {0.SimFirstName} is a hero in the publishing industry!
{0.SimFirstName} gets lucky and the news doesn’t break. And instead of just waiting around all day {M0.he}{F0.she} got a lot of writing done!
{0.SimFirstName} replies to the anonymous celebrity who fell in love with his own professional look-alike, but readers don’t believe that the letter is true. Worse, now they are starting to believe that all {M0.his}{F0.her} letters are fake.
By playing it safe, {0.SimFirstName} avoids any damage to {M0.his}{F0.her} career. Of course, {M0.he}{F0.she} also does no specific good to {M0.his}{F0.her} career either.
Nobody expects this stuff to be exciting, right? {0.SimFirstName} will save {M0.his}{F0.her} energy for when something better comes along.
Whoops. Looks like the Co-worker's story about a cross-species liaison and its galacto-political ramifications is just a little too unique. They find out about {0.SimFirstName}'s plagiarism and report it to {F0.her}{M0.his} manager.
Readers hate the new columnist - perfect!! They read every column and always leave comments. Traffic is traffic!
The reader’s just don’t like embellishment for embellishment’s sake. Local news is supposed to be boring. {0.SimFirstName} promises to tone it down from now on.
Once the other writer got done, it barely resembled the original book, or anything else {0.SimFirstName}’s ever written. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fans are confused, critics are confused, and {0.SimFirstName}’s embarrassed.
Throwing caution to the wind, {0.SimFirstName} rolls up {M0.his}{F0.her} sleeves, sets {M0.his}{F0.her} jaw, and boldly does the exact same thing {M0.he}{F0.she} always does, having no impact on {M0.his}{F0.her} career in any way at all.
{M0.His}{F0.Her} job isn’t to comment on history, just to provide the facts. The country is rocked. {0.SimFirstName}’s name will live on forever as a groundbreaking historian.
A famous singer releases an album that’s so terrible, critics are too busy shredding it to even notice {0.SimFirstName}’s subpar book! It flies under the radar.
The news breaks and the internet goes crazy… too bad {0.SimFirstName} isn’t paying attention. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a story up an hour later, but that’s far too late. {M0.His}{F0.Her} site didn’t get a single hit.
The entire comments section under the article is just people calling {0.SimFirstName} out for yellow journalism, instead of just the usual 80% of the comments. That’s not good.
What kind of celebrity is too good to say hello? The fan vows to never again buy one of {0.SimFirstName}’s books, and plans to take his story straight to his {0.SimName} fan site so other readers can know how the author treats {M0.his}{F0.her} fans!
{0.SimFirstName}’s advice to the anonymous celebrity who fell in love with his own professional look-alike is {M0.his}{F0.her} most-read column ever. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s a hit!
Uh-oh. {0.SimFirstName} forgot that sensible journalism is the worst way to get traffic. The moderate is bland, so readers are looking elsewhere to reinforce the opinions they already have.
The child hangs on {0.SimFirstName}’s every word, and then posts all of the spoilers on a major website. Now the whole world knows how the next book will end. Wow, that sick little girl was kind of a jerk!
It turns out that the mysterious “stalker” was just another journalist who was trying to scoop {0.SimFirstName} all along! Since {0.SimFirstName} gave up, the other journalist gets the story and the glory. 
Busted! All it took was one reference check to unravel the lie. Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to work twice as hard to move up.
Well, it is the proofreader’s job to catch errors. The fault is entirely his! Nothing bad happens to {0.SimFirstName}, but the proofreader gets fired.
The host is such a jerk that viewers hated the segment. Nobody noticed {0.SimFirstName} or {M0.his}{F0.her} book, and {0.SimFirstName} didn’t look so good either.
The assistant got some credit, but now he wants even more. {0.SimFirstName} gives him a generous “bonus” to make him go away.
{0.SimFirstName} lives to work another day. The story probably wasn’t worth it anyway.
Just because {0.SimFirstName} earned the money, that doesn’t mean that {M0.he}{F0.she} won’t have to beg now and then. Ah, freelance work! Fortunately in this case {M0.he}{F0.she} is able to get what {M0.he}{F0.she}’s owed.
{0.SimFirstName} waited around, but nothing better came up. Now {M0.he}{F0.she}’s behind and has nothing to show for it, so {M0.his}{F0.her} boss is livid.
The site has to print a correction, but it’s not really that big of a deal. {0.SimFirstName} made a good call.
Readers think that {0.SimFirstName}’s paper has become just another cog in the government machine. They expected {M0.him}{F0.her} to be more courageous.
Leave ASAP
Be Friendly
Focus In
Work as Usual
Juice It Up
Stick to the Facts
{0.SimFirstName} preserves {M0.his}{F0.her} vision of the story, and {M0.he}{F0.she}’s happy with {M0.his}{F0.her} decision. No more hearing how movies based on books are always disappointing.
Be Honest

Move On
Beg for the Paycheck
It turns out that it was still a great story, even without those details. And now {0.SimFirstName} has some extra spending cash!
Without those details the article was boring, and {M0.his}{F0.her} boss hated it. At least {M0.he}{F0.she} has the cash to cheer {0.SimPronounObjective} up!

Wait a second, these superspy catsuits don’t have any pockets?! How are spies supposed to hide documents and stuff? {0.SimFirstName}’s still trying to figure it out as the guards pluck the document right out of {M0.his}{F0.her} hands.
Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on sometimes. After telling {0.SimFirstName} all about his failing marriage, delinquent children, and addiction to home shopping, he feels closer to {0.SimFirstName} than ever, and vows to help get {M0.him}{F0.her} a promotion. 
A criminal from the agency’s most-wanted list strolls onto the scene—with the item. {0.SimFirstName} tackles him, and in the scuffle manages to disarm and subdue him. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets the package and a dangerous lowlife off the streets. 
Really? {0.SimFirstName} got where {M0.he}{F0.she} is because someone trained {M0.him}{F0.her} how to do it? What a predictable, expected thing to say. {0.SimFirstName}'s speech turns the whole room into a snoozefest. 
Anyone could have had access to those documents, so when the story hits the papers, no one can pin the leak on {0.SimFirstName}.
The office is evacuated and a full bug sweep is done...only to reveal a malfunctioning pager in a drawer. Now everyone in the agency is laughing at {0.SimFirstName} even harder than at the guy who still had a pager! 
{M0.He}{F0.She} just can’t beat this one. Finally {0.SimFirstName} has to admit defeat to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, and it turns out {M0.he}{F0.she} just had the wrong password. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss is not amused.
Just a few more minutes and the agent would have been a goner. {0.SimFirstName} saved his life. The agency and the agent are grateful. 
Those pics will come in handy the next time {0.SimFirstName} needs someone on {M0.his}{F0.her} side or {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to deflect attention from {M0.his}{F0.her} mistakes. And if {M0.he}{F0.she} starts to think that extortion isn’t morally defensible, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} just remind {M0.himself}{F0.herself} that this is what secret agents DO.
The item they were looking for just didn’t turn up. The team gets out safely, but without what they came for. 
{0.SimFirstName} wins fair and square, because hard work and perseverance always beat underhanded techniques! Yeah, {0.SimFirstName}’s surprised, too.
The assembled Supreme Villains nod and applaud politely. Is it time to eat yet?
{0.SimFirstName} manages to switch off the phone without being discovered, but the moment is ruined. The informant gives up some intel, but not what {0.SimFirstName} really wanted.
All it takes is a stealthy kick in the shin for the rival agent to go down. {0.SimFirstName} wins the sack race and the admiration of all. 
The buzzing goes away almost as fast as it appeared. Things seem to be normal, so {0.SimFirstName}’s pretty sure everything’s fine for now.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to trip {M0.his}{F0.her} rival, but the rival’s quicker than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought—{0.SimFirstName} whiffs and ends up on {M0.his}{F0.her} back. {M0.He}{F0.She} loses the race and looks like a fool.
The important take away here is that sometimes cheating totally works. {0.SimFirstName} loses, and no one sees that {M0.his}{F0.her} rival was cheating. Hooray! Another moral victory for {0.SimName}!
{0.SimFirstName} manages to hold out for a few minutes until reinforcements show up. Just in time, too—{0.SimFirstName} was running out of fingernails to have things shoved under.
When they hear that {0.SimFirstName} works for Good, the henchmen relax a bit. Turns out they’re undercover, too. The three trade stories about the best places to hide an audio wire.
{0.SimFirstName} knows these guys really just want a friend. After only a few minutes the suspect gives up his boss, his boss’s boss, and everyone else he’s ever worked for.
The other researcher does a stellar job, and {0.SimFirstName} promises to cover for him when he's in a pinch. {0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are pleased. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s mentor explains how he’s just been having trouble at home, and everything goes back to normal—until the mentor goes rogue during a mission and publicly announces his alliance change! If {0.SimFirstName} had told someone sooner, maybe they could have stopped him from flipping. 
Oh, right! National security! A lot of those secrets are not {0.SimFirstName}’s to give away. The deal with the publisher is canceled, and {0.SimFirstName} is sharply reprimanded by {M0.his}{F0.her} bosses. 
The villain brings backup, and only someone with a temper problem and lack of respect for authority could handle it. {0.SimFirstName}’s hothead agent makes some split-second decisions that save everyone’s lives.
Before {M0.he}{F0.she} can swallow, the guards rush over and pry it out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. Really? Eating the evidence? The guards seem to show more pity than anger.
{0.SimFirstName}’s handlers know that {M0.his}{F0.her} integrity is above suspicion. {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} never turn traitor just for a few lousy Simoleons. It’d have to be an absolute TON of Simoleons. 
A criminal from the agency’s most-wanted list strolls onto the scene—with the item. {0.SimFirstName} tries to tackle him, but he gets away.
On his way out the door, the informant snatches up two weapons prototypes and {0.SimFirstName}’s lunch from the fridge. Sayonara, suckers!
{0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are satisfied with {M0.his}{F0.her} findings. When you’re a spy, you start to get suspicious of everyone, after all. {M0.His}{F0.Her} trust within the agency has never been higher. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s outfit is so average, so unremarkable, that {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes a virtual ghost. Nobody notices {0.SimPronounObjective} as {M0.he}{F0.she} goes about {M0.his}{F0.her} spy business and the mission proceeds like clockwork.
Thanks to a hidden pocket in a very private place on {M0.his}{F0.her} body, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} able to successfully conceal the document as {M0.he}{F0.she} makes {M0.his}{F0.her} escape, jumping out a window and landing in some bushes. 
Who comes home and goes directly to the attic?! The suspect, apparently. {0.SimFirstName}’s team is caught red-handed and the case is blown. 
Lobro is as kind and magnanimous as he is evil and power-hungry. He signs an autograph, takes a selfie, and promises to call {0.SimFirstName} if he ever has an opening for a nemesis. 
{0.SimFirstName} was able to catch a suspect, but {M0.his}{F0.her} superiors are not convinced {0.SimFirstName} has the evidence to put the perp away! The last thing anyone wants is for the suspect to get off on a technicality and roam the world again.
The publisher sounds pretty excited to have the rights to {0.SimFirstName}’s story! There’s already talk of a major motion picture and tie-in video game. 
{0.SimFirstName} gets a call a little later. The dog got better, the grandma is overjoyed, and the informant will never squeal again. Even Supreme Villains get happy endings! 
{0.SimFirstName} shoves the paper into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth and hastily chews it down. It’s not the worst document {0.SimFirstName}'s ever eaten, but it’s not the best. The guards will never be able to figure out what {M0.he}{F0.she} took. 
{0.SimFirstName} shows the villains a prototype of {M0.his}{F0.her} Über Oscillation Vortex. The crowd goes wild! One audience member is so impressed, he spills his experimental age-reverse potion onto himself and immediately de-grows into an infant.
{0.SimFirstName} is a shadow agent, so {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} good at keeping secrets. {M0.He}{F0.She} finds the money and no one at HQ is ever the wiser. 
{0.SimFirstName} chooses the most likely candidate, who's dragged away protesting his innocence. &quot;Wow, who'd have thought?&quot; murmurs the big boss. {0.SimFirstName}'s secret is safe...for now.
The information on the disk is so valuable, it should never fall into the wrong hands. {0.SimFirstName}'s handler is glad that {M0.he}{F0.she} made the right call.
{0.SimFirstName} laughs {M0.his}{F0.her} best maniacal laughter and gleefully tells the informant that he’s headed for a tour of Prison Island, where inmates are hunted for sport before being forced to watch bad reality TV.
Being out on her own forced the young agent to learn to think quickly and rely on her wits. Now {0.SimFirstName} is regarded as a wise, skilled leader. 
Although {0.SimFirstName} tries desperately to make meaningful eye contact, {M0.he}{F0.she} clams up and lets Lobro pass by. {M0.He}{F0.She}’ll always wonder what might have been.
It turns out that the “reporter” was really an internal agency investigator. {0.SimFirstName} passed the loyalty test with flying colors, and it looks really good on {M0.his}{F0.her} file.
Seriously? Hardened criminals don’t just roll over because someone says “Please.” The suspect laughs in {0.SimFirstName}’s face and refuses to talk. 
The information the agent retrieved was so valuable, {0.SimFirstName}’s superiors don’t care that {M0.he}{F0.she} broke the rules.
At the last second {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} has no idea what to whisper, and winds up suggesting some pretty unsettling things. The informant leaves before revealing any intel.
{0.SimFirstName}'s Evil boss is starting to mistrust {M0.him}{F0.her}...another failure will look really bad.
{0.SimFirstName}’s partner will never know the truth, but they’ll never be able to work closely together either. The life of a spy is lonely and complicated, but it’s what {0.SimFirstName} signed up for.
Everyone loves a humble superspy! There’s not a dry eye in the house as {0.SimFirstName} tearfully dedicates {M0.his}{F0.her} award to the woman who taught {0.SimPronounObjective} how to break someone’s wrist just by touching their arm. 
{0.SimFirstName} successfully threatens, fist-wags, and spittle-flecks {M0.his}{F0.her} way to a confession. It’s not pretty, but this is how law enforcement is done. 
That package is probably halfway around the world by now. {0.SimFirstName} calls it in. HQ will try to track it, but no one expects to find it. 
While rifling through some boxes, {0.SimFirstName} hears sirens. The suspect heard noises downstairs and called the police. Now {0.SimFirstName}’s team has a LOT of explaining to do
The young agent is incompetent, and without {0.SimFirstName} there to hold it together, the whole mission would have been a disaster. The agency is grateful for {0.SimFirstName}’s dedication and hands-on style. 
Here it is! With the item in hand, {0.SimFirstName}’s team uses bedsheets to rappel down the side of the house and escape into the night. Good thing this guy keeps his bedsheets in the attic! 
The young agent barely knows her grenade pen from her actual pen, and the mission is nearly a disaster. Not that it's {0.SimFirstName}’s fault—{M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t want the agent on {M0.his}{F0.her} team in the first place. 
As the sun comes up, {0.SimFirstName} finally finishes the big report. But then {M0.he}{F0.she} crashes under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and misses the presentation meeting! The work is done, but missing the meeting doesn’t look good on {M0.his}{F0.her} record. 
Turns out that last year’s President of the Supreme Villains was killed by a rogue vortex, and the villains are not amused. They shame {0.SimFirstName} from the stage with a flurry of boos and lasers.
{0.SimFirstName} will take {M0.his}{F0.her} secrets to {M0.his}{F0.her} grave, if necessary, because that’s what Double Diamond Agents do. 
“For always inspiring me to work faster, punch harder, and decrypt codes more accurately, I thank you.” {0.SimFirstName} dedicating {M0.his}{F0.her} award to {M0.his}{F0.her} nemesis is regarded as gutsy and courageous. 
Senior agents can’t come running to the rescue every time. “You’ve got to start taking more initiative,” says {0.SimFirstName}’s boss. This isn’t going to look good on {M0.his}{F0.her} next performance review. 
“If you had failed, I was going to have you taken out,” {0.SimFirstName}’s Evil boss says, and then he enjoys a hearty laugh. It’s so nice to have a boss with a sense of humor again! 
Not all evildoing is exciting. Some isn’t even remotely interesting! Still, evil is evil, so {0.SimFirstName} cancels out the threat and all is well. 
The rules are there for a reason, {0.SimFirstName}...agents can't just make things up as they go. The hothead deviates from the plan and the whole mission is compromised. 
No op ever goes according to plan, and the bookworm just isn’t decisive enough. When things get real, the bookworm spends the whole time crying in the corner and {0.SimFirstName} looks terrible to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss.
{0.SimFirstName}'s skills must be a little rusty.... {M0.he}{F0.she} can't manage to locate the cache. If {M0.he}{F0.she} called in {M0.his}{F0.her} support team {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} have to share, so {M0.he}{F0.she} lets it go.
The creeps in IT love the pictures! The other agent wasn’t breaking any rules, so he doesn’t get in trouble, but he’s definitely embarrassed. {0.SimFirstName} even gets a new hard drive! 
The other researcher intentionally makes errors and leaves out information in order to make {0.SimFirstName} look bad. Now the other researcher is in line for a promotion and {0.SimFirstName}’s boss thinks {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} incompetent. 
Without {0.SimFirstName} in the office to manage {M0.his}{F0.her} caseload, all {M0.his}{F0.her} other cases fall apart. {M0.He}{F0.She} returns home to a mountain of paperwork. 
Suddenly, doors open, drinks are offered, and attractive strangers want to help. {0.SimFirstName} discovers that life’s just easier for the terminally hot. The mission’s completed in half the time and {0.SimFirstName} enjoys a little time off. 
Hey, what else is {M0.he}{F0.she} going to do with {M0.himself}{F0.herself}? {0.SimFirstName} doggedly keeps pursuing {M0.his}{F0.her} quarry until he slips up, and {0.SimFirstName} slaps some cuffs on him. Unfortunately, there’s no one available at the agency to process him! Oops.
The suspect’s response to being threatened? A surprisingly accurate detailing of prisoner’s rights according to domestic law and international human rights principles. Huh. {0.SimFirstName} is not getting anything out of this guy aside from a lesson in ethics. 
{M0.His}{F0.Her} getup attracts so much attention from strangers that {0.SimFirstName} finds it hard to get anything done. The mission is a total fail because {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t manage to be alone. 
Evil was just a lucky guess…all these henchmen look alike. The three share a few laughs and chat a bit about improvised surgery and the best way to burn off fingerprints.
The new partner does not react to that information well. Fortunately, he just thinks {0.SimFirstName} is only trying to test HIM, and doesn’t take it as the literal truth. That was close!
Really? All that work, and there’s no mole after all? {0.SimFirstName}’s findings make the agency even more suspicious, and now they are starting to think {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} in on it… 
{0.SimFirstName} enjoys a little “me time” in the office alone. Peeking in Co-workers’ desks, humming loudly to {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, making creative weapons from office supplies – good times! By the end of the day the budget dispute is ended but {0.SimFirstName} has to restart {M0.his}{F0.her} search from scratch.
After inspecting the electrical sockets, techs discover that the whole office is bugged! {0.SimFirstName}’s bosses praise {M0.his}{F0.her} spy instincts and promise to fast-track {0.SimPronounObjective} to Agent status. 
After some ingenious crypto-work, {0.SimFirstName} beats the firewall, and discovers that nothing is what it seems. {M0.He}{F0.She} rushes {M0.his}{F0.her} findings to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, and it turns out {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} uncovered a nefarious plot!
Internal Affairs carts {0.SimFirstName}'s mentor off kicking and screaming. He swears he's innocent, but that's what they all say. 
It turns out that the new guy’s a double agent too! Wacky! Now that they know the truth about each other, they are even more effective. 
Later, during a routine sweep, techs discover that the whole office was bugged! {0.SimFirstName} could have saved hours of compromised work if only {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} spoken up.
Slick move. The informant is very excited to be with {0.SimFirstName}, and gives up some great intel.
It takes a special mind to deliver on such a complicated case, and {0.SimFirstName} makes sure the suspect is caught and brought to justice. {M0.His}{F0.Her} handiwork will not go unrecognized by the higher-ups.
No one could have predicted that the villain would bring his foreign henchmen, but luckily the bookworm speaks their language like a pro. At least enough to say “Freeze—get down and put your hands up!”
Pssh, Lobro didn’t get where he is by mingling with the littles. Lobro’s henchmen tell {0.SimFirstName} that {M0.his}{F0.her} company is not appreciated, but they say it with punching.

Maybe they're right. Maybe that red square with a blue dot is a bold statement about humanity's resilience in the post-modern world. {0.SimFirstName} decides to say so. The crowd nods quietly.
Mow over Sticks
Pick Up Sticks
Improvise
Use the Backhoe
Go Back to Nursery
Level by Hand
Yeah! {0.SimFirstName} feels like a true backhoe master…until the backhoe flips with {M0.him}{F0.her} in it. A note for future reference: to be a backhoe driver you need two things—a working backhoe and a healthy driver!
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t paid the big bucks for acting like a fool. {M0.He}{F0.She} parks {M0.his}{F0.her} backhoe safely and uses a shovel instead. It will take longer and mess up the timeline a bit, but {M0.he}{F0.she} knows that it’s not worth taking the risk.
Well, youthful inexperience only gets you so far, especially when a stick jams your mower. {0.SimFirstName} can’t finish the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} circuit, and has to spend {M0.his}{F0.her} shift clearing out {M0.his}{F0.her} blades instead.
{0.SimFirstName} squeezes through the nursery gate just as the owner is locking up. Grabbing the last few petunias, {M0.he}{F0.she} slaps down a few Simoleons and heads back to finish the job. The result: a perfect petunia path, perfectly on time. {0.SimFirstName}’s boss and the client are perfectly pleased.
With a little creative rearranging, {0.SimFirstName} makes the petunia path even more elegant than before.  {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss is a bit nervous, of course, but when {0.SimFirstName} assures the client that minimal design is in, everyone praises {M0.his}{F0.her} forward (and frugal) thinking.
That’s right! {0.SimFirstName} is a backhoe master! Guiding the machine skillfully, {M0.he}{F0.she}  suddenly realizes how much {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} learned. All this practice is paying off!
Eager to Show off {M0.his}{F0.her} creativity, {0.SimFirstName} rearranges the flower garden, mixing colors and sizes to conceal what's missing. The client isn't exactly appreciative. In fact, he's furious. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss apologizes for the mistake and makes {0.SimPronounObjective} redo the entire job.
Better safe than sorry! {0.SimFirstName} collects all the sticks as fast as {M0.he}{F0.she} can and does a thorough job mowing the lawn. The owners give {M0.him}{F0.her} a grateful wave, and {M0.he}{F0.she} still has a working mower to finish the next job!
{0.SimFirstName} mows right over the sticks and finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} route in record time. Impressed, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss promises to give {0.SimPronounObjective} more work, maybe even focusing on some tidier houses!
Behind Schedule
{0.SimFirstName} is already running behind schedule when {M0.he}{F0.she} arrives at a particularly cluttered yard. {M0.He}{F0.She} clears all the kids’ toys, but notices there are still tons of sticks on the grass from the shade trees above. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} pick them up, or just mow over them?
Uneven Terrain
{0.SimFirstName} is clearing a lot for the brand-new SuperPlex when {M0.he}{F0.she} comes across some uneven terrain. Just at the edge, where the JumboSign should go, the hill rises sharply on one side and drops on the other. {M0.He}{F0.She} knows it would be safest to level this part by hand, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} on a tight schedule.
Landscape Project
{0.SimFirstName} is almost done with a stunning landscaping project when {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he}{F0.she} is two petunias short. The project is already a week behind schedule. {M0.He}{F0.She} can try running back to the nursery to get more, or work with what {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got.
At High School
Sure enough, {0.SimFirstName} gets an A for {M0.his}{F0.her} beginner’s origami. (And the little paper frog even hops when you press it!) The good grade brings up {M0.his}{F0.her} entire average by a point or two!
Although {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not as wired and amped-up as some of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, {0.SimFirstName} feels good about {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to give {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a rest. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes the test feeling refreshed, and can easily recall all of the required information.
OK, so {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t get 100%...{M0.he}{F0.she} got 98%, which is pretty darn good. Not re-taking the test means {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} happier and less stressed out.
{0.SimFirstName}’s brain goes into hyperwarp as {M0.he}{F0.she} begins devouring information. Luckily, the sugar and caffeine rush lasts all the way through the test before a mighty crash hits. Nailed it.
The teacher seems as bored as {0.SimFirstName} is, and doesn’t even notice the spitballs, despite {0.SimFirstName} landing a papery clump right in a classmate’s ponytail.
The teacher’s errand didn’t take as long as he thought, so he comes back and sees {0.SimFirstName} not doing the reading. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a lecture on the importance of sitting quietly and following orders.
Right after the lights come up, the teacher hands around a quiz—{0.SimFirstName} has no idea what the plot of the movie was! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets an F when {M0.he}{F0.she} should have been able to score some easy points.
Since {M0.he}{F0.she} has time to focus, {0.SimFirstName} finishes the reading early. Then {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to do some of {M0.his}{F0.her} homework too!
{0.SimFirstName} breezes through the easy test, and the extra study time on the harder test really pays off! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets and A- and a B+! Not bad!
{0.SimFirstName} is no better off than {M0.he}{F0.she} was yesterday, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} no worse off, either. Although the teacher is disappointed that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t show more initiative.
Turns out that the class can be pretty interesting! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} will make a habit of this “learning” stuff. 
The good grade does bring up {0.SimFirstName}’s average, but the assignment is so mind-numbing that {M0.he}{F0.she} wishes {M0.he}{F0.she}’d taken something a little more stimulating.
{0.SimFirstName} unleashes a tirade of poetic insults and put-downs, then drops an imaginary mic. The bullies quickly lose interest in harassing someone who’s willing to stand up for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.
This seems less like a study group and more like an opportunity for the smartest kids to show off how much they already know. {0.SimFirstName} is so far behind that listening to them doesn’t really help at all.
{0.SimFirstName} refuses, blaming the teacher. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} heard that you can’t get anything past that guy! The friend understands and doesn’t blame {M0.him}{F0.her} at all.
The rival suspiciously takes the notebook, but then blames {0.SimFirstName} for stealing it in the first place. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} has to explain that {M0.he}{F0.she} was just trying to do a good deed. Yeesh!
Once they see how hard {0.SimFirstName}'s working, the other kids start slacking off! No good deed goes unpunished.
Well, it feels pretty good to have done the right thing. That giant 0% on a major assignment doesn’t feel great, but it’s better than getting expelled, right?
Adding something so difficult impresses the teacher. {0.SimFirstName} is clearly ready to get serious about {M0.his}{F0.her} education. Even though {M0.he}{F0.she} only manages an average grade, {M0.he}{F0.she} still learns a lot of new information that can be applied in class.
Wrong answer. Oh well—{0.SimFirstName} knew the risks when gerunds got involved. 
The movie is pretty good. This hardly feels like school at all! And {0.SimFirstName} always wanted to learn how astronauts go to the bathroom in zero gravity.
{0.SimFirstName} really has been working hard in school! A few minutes into giving {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a quick rest...{M0.he}{F0.she} falls asleep! The slap of papers on {M0.his}{F0.her} desk jolts {0.SimPronounObjective} awake a short time later. Test time already?! Oh no!
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher lets {0.SimPronounObjective} do some extra problems. The teacher would rather see {0.SimPronounObjective} understand the concept a little late than not at all. {M0.He}{F0.She} gratefully completes the work and earns a few extra points on {M0.his}{F0.her} grade.
The guidance counselor is so concerned with {0.SimFirstName}’s descriptions of academia-induced hyper-stress (an entirely made up condition) that she insists {0.SimFirstName} be excused from the next few tests. Nice! 
If {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} only worked harder, if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} only tried again, {M0.he}{F0.she} could have achieved test-taking perfection. Everyone knows that perfection is a totally achievable goal and to settle for anything less is shameful.
{0.SimFirstName} really did know most of the answers for the easy test already. The extra review didn’t help much. That time could have been spent studying for the other test, which was brutal. {M0.He}{F0.She} winds up with an A+ and a C-. Not the best.
Surprisingly, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates do not like getting hit in the face with spit and paper. The teacher sighs and sends {0.SimFirstName} to the principal’s office. 
The owner is grateful to get it back, and invites {0.SimFirstName} to {M0.his}{F0.her} house to study sometime. {0.SimFirstName} didn’t want to get ahead by being dishonest.
The lost money gets reported and the principal orders a full locker sweep! {0.SimFirstName} gets caught with the money and sent to detention.
Even though this wasn’t {0.SimFirstName}'s idea, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are angry about having {0.SimPronounObjective} in charge. They refuse to participate or behave, and eventually {0.SimFirstName} has to call the principal for help!
The straight A kids would rather just do something quickly and correctly than wait around for someone else to figure it out. They don’t mind doing {0.SimFirstName}'s work, and {M0.he}{F0.she} looks good at the end of the project.
After thirty minutes of laughing and having fun with friends, {0.SimFirstName} feels totally refreshed and ready to get back to work. It’s almost like {M0.his}{F0.her} brain functions better when {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} well-rounded!
The teacher’s drone is like a sweet, sweet lullaby gently rocking {0.SimFirstName} into a nap. But when {M0.he}{F0.she} starts drooling the teacher snaps {M0.him}{F0.her} awake with a detention.
The extra study time was vital for that difficult test, and brushing up on the material for the easy test was worthwhile too! {0.SimFirstName} earns a B+ and an A! Sweet!
{0.SimFirstName} earns a whopping 25% on the test! {M0.He}{F0.She} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} should have gone with the repeating A, B, C, D pattern instead. Well, live and learn!
The project benefits from having everyone’s input. It’s a standout success and the teacher gives {0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} teammates equally high grades.
The principal acknowledges the courage it took to bring the money to him. He then launches into a 20-minute speech about honesty and integrity that {0.SimFirstName} tunes out of halfway through. But the principal does insist that {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher give {M0.him}{F0.her} extra credit for good citizenship!
If bullies responded to well-crafted arguments, they wouldn’t be bullies. They understand that they’re being insulted, but they don’t quite understand how, and that just makes them madder.
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend has never been known for subtlety. The teacher sees the crib sheet {0.SimFirstName} made sitting out on the desk. Both {M0.he}{F0.she} and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend fail the test, and get a stern talking to.
{0.SimFirstName} sets a new personal record for cola consumption and finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} far too busy bouncing off the walls to prepare for the test properly.
The class can finish the assignment later—now it’s time for a game of Truth Or Dodgeball, where people either answer embarrassing questions or get hit by dodgeballs. That’s what the teacher gets for storing dodgeballs in the classroom!
“Why, what a nice presentation. How straightforward and expected,” says the teacher. {0.SimFirstName} earns a straightforward and expected grade.
Even after all that work, {0.SimFirstName} still doesn’t quite get it. But {M0.he}{F0.she} learned that sometimes in life there’s credit for just showing up and trying—the teacher bumped {M0.his}{F0.her} grade up by a few points anyway.
Although the teacher loves it, {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates grumble that {M0.he}{F0.she} made them all look bad. They’re angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for throwing off the curve.
Although {0.SimFirstName} tells the counselor the truth—{M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t feel encouraged to try harder—the counselor doesn’t believe it’s that simple. Now {0.SimFirstName} has to come back three times per week to talk about {M0.his}{F0.her} “feelings.”
School Flower Fundraiser
In honor of {1.String}, {0.SimFirstName}’s school always allows students to buy flowers to be delivered to each other during class. With some money to spend, {0.SimFirstName} decided to take advantage of the fundraiser and celebrate the holiday!
Hunger Strikes
{0.SimFirstName} is really trying to pay attention in class, but {M0.his}{F0.her} stomach is growling LOUDLY. These darn growth spurts...now {0.SimFirstName} is worried {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates can hear. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to sneak a snack from {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch, or wait for the bell?
Friend's Birthday?
Everyone seems to be talking about a birthday party that {0.SimFirstName} wasn’t invited to. {M0.He}{F0.She} kind of thought the host was {M0.his}{F0.her} friend, so it doesn’t make any sense. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} ask {M0.his}{F0.her} friend, or let it go?
Class Interview
{0.SimFirstName} is the class All Star today, and {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to be interviewed by {M0.his}{F0.her} entire class! {M0.He}{F0.She}’s feeling nervous and kind of excited, until someone asks, “How come you always get A’s?” Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try for something witty, or just be real, like the teacher said?
Love Letter
{0.SimFirstName} is grabbing {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch from {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices something red inside. It’s a note, shaped like a heart, with the words “U R CUTE!” written on it and nothing else. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks it might be the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy}, who always seems to stare. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} ask {M0.her}{F0.him}, or wait and see?
Tissue Paper Flowers
In celebration of {1.String}, {0.SimFirstName}’s class made tissue paper flowers! The teacher asked all of the students to give their flowers away to someone special. Now, {0.SimFirstName} just needed to think of the right person…
Go to High School
Go to Grade School
Yuck! Disgusting. The mystery glop is chunkier than it first looked and REEKS of re-processed onion.  {0.SimFirstName} drops {M0.his}{F0.her} rag in the trash and scrubs {M0.his}{F0.her} hands raw, but the stink sticks for what seems like hours.
Well, that backfired. Instead of graciously stepping aside, the customer is furious and takes even more time complaining about the “lack of respect” and “pitiful service” and “problems with today’s youth.” Her yammering brings out {0.SimFirstName}’s new manager, who ends up comping her order.
Five second rule, right? {0.SimFirstName} slaps on some cheese and extra sauce and moves on to the next order. Unfortunately, this order was for one of those “check the burger and notice hair and used chewing gum stuck to it” customers. The customer yells at the manager, who in turn yells at {0.SimFirstName}.
No one can actually take forever, even if it feels like it sometimes. {0.SimFirstName}’s smile is frozen to {M0.his}{F0.her} face, but eventually {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the woman’s order and turns to the next person in line. So much for fast food. But fortunately no one seems too surprised.
Five second rule, right? {0.SimFirstName} slaps on some cheese and extra sauce and moves on to the next order. When no complaints come back, {M0.he}{F0.she} sighs in relief, trying not to notice the grime on the floor.
The manager isn’t thrilled about the extra time or wasted meat, but {0.SimFirstName} sure feels better doing the right thing. Not that {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} ever eat here, knowing what {M0.he}{F0.she} knows, but it gives {M0.him}{F0.her} hope someone might do the same for {M0.him}{F0.her} someday.
Luckily, it’s just about time for {0.SimFirstName}’s break. Unluckily, a shriek interrupts {M0.his}{F0.her}  departure. A cheerleader just sat down in the mess, and she is not happy about it at all. {0.SimFirstName}’s manager calls {0.SimPronounObjective} out to wipe down all the chairs while the entire restaurant watches.
Luckily, it’s just about time for {0.SimFirstName}’s break. By the time {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} back, the mystery glop is gone, though where it went {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t know.
Nice work! When {0.SimFirstName} points out the line behind her, the woman agrees to let someone else go first. Even better, {0.SimFirstName}’s new manager is watching and praises {M0.his}{F0.her} “proactive thinking.” Score!
Wait for Her Order
Ask to Step Aside
When {0.SimFirstName} takes over the register, the line is already out the door. But it seems the customer at the counter hasn’t noticed:  the woman squints at the menu, grimaces, thinks. The line’s getting longer—and grumpier. Should {0.SimFirstName} ask her to step aside to decide on her order, or wait for her to make up her mind?
{0.SimFirstName} is on a roll! This joint is so clean, {M0.he}{F0.she} can see {M0.his}{F0.her} face gleaming back from the tabletops! But then {M0.he}{F0.she} notices some kind of pinkish glop jiggling from the seat of a chair. {M0.He}{F0.She} could just wipe it—and throw out {M0.his}{F0.her} rag—but then again {M0.his}{F0.her} job title does say “table...”
{0.SimFirstName} is barely keeping up with the lunch rush when a burger slips off {M0.his}{F0.her} spatula onto the floor. Instinctively {M0.he}{F0.she} pounces, snatching up the steaming patty before anyone sees. Really, it was only there for 4 seconds. Will the customer even know?
What Seat? Where?

Get a New One

Lunch Rush
What a howl! There’s nothing animal lovers love more than a few good animal jokes! The crowd goes wild and donates generously. Now these animals should have a better quality of life than {0.SimFirstName} does!
Unfortunately nobody shows up, for {0.SimFirstName} or the other “comic”. {0.SimFirstName} is sure {M0.he}{F0.she} was the funniest {M0.guy}{F0.gal} in the house, and now, no one can argue.
Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} should have trusted {M0.his}{F0.her} instincts. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets crickets for {M0.his}{F0.her} disgusting humor. Why’d they laugh for the other comic? It seems gross only stays fresh so long...
{0.SimFirstName} creates a scene fending off the old piano player. The crowd is not happy. They come to listen to old standards and forget about life for a while, not watch ugly confrontations between selfish pianists! The bar owner intercedes and gives the set to the other player.
The indignant mother leaves in a huff, sticking {0.SimFirstName} with the bill for the repair. So much for “extra cash on the side.”
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend loves the dig! He is so thrilled to be part of the routine that he buys {0.SimFirstName} a drink to celebrate.
Later, {0.SimFirstName} sees one of the other composers giving an interview where he claims full credit for the final score. Is anyone even going to believe that {0.SimFirstName} helped once the interview is published?
The director refuses. He loves the script how it is, and he makes sure his colleagues know where the credit belongs: with the other comedians.
Not only is {0.SimFirstName} twice as frustrated, the cellist in the practice room next door is frustrated too. It would be easier to get it right without all that pounding on the wall.
At first {0.SimFirstName} thinks the cellist hasn’t heard {M0.him}{F0.her}. But when {M0.he}{F0.she} tries again, it’s clear {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} getting brushed off. {M0.He}{F0.She} wonders if {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} wind up being blamed for the discordant tones once they perform.
It might not be the most glamorous gig, but {0.SimFirstName} feels that {M0.he}{F0.she} made the right choice. Sims enjoy the music and a decent amount of money is raised for a good cause.
The child squeals with delight and throws {0.SimFirstName} every ball he can find. It goes well until the kid tosses in a muddy kickball, which lands on his mom’s white sofa. Trying to recover it, {0.SimFirstName} lets the other balls fall. The kids crack up. Mom doesn’t.
Good call. After {0.SimFirstName} gets a drink, {M0.he}{F0.she} feels much better and the notes just seem to fall into place. There’s no stopping {0.SimFirstName} now!
Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} receives a huge tip and is even hazily visible in an industry magazine photo!
That won’t be the only postponed lesson. After an hour of dabbing at the keys with a dish cloth, {0.SimFirstName} is forced to admit that the piano needs to be professionally serviced. The instrument will be unplayable for a while.
The crowd is insulted. A lady in a purple pants suit yells, “We’re not all deaf!” She gets more laughs than {0.SimFirstName} does.
It should be written somewhere: never side with the establishment against your own fans. {0.SimFirstName}’s fans storm out and smash {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation on every message board and social site they can think of. Why do fans get so angry??
That hole that {0.SimFirstName}’s been digging? It’s getting deeper. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} about to try more new material when people start yawning, stretching and claiming it’s time to turn in.
{0.SimFirstName}’s new jokes work! Most of the time that is. And the adrenaline of taking a risk makes {M0.him}{F0.her} come off as fresh and confident, which everyone loves. {0.SimFirstName} wins!
The problem with covers is that someone has always played them a little better. You know, like the rock legends who created them. {0.SimFirstName} gets polite applause, and is promptly forgotten.
How dare {0.SimFirstName} insult the dignity of animals by laughing at their expense! The crowd is generous with their disapproval and stingy with their donations. {0.SimFirstName} donates part of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay to make up for it.
The starlet berates {0.SimFirstName} for ditching the charity, and frets that the choice will taint her impeccable reputation. The tip money {0.SimFirstName} hoped for goes to the starlet’s publicist to clean up the mess.
So it turns out {0.SimFirstName} does not remember how to juggle. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should stick to more mature crowds. At least there’s fewer spitballs.
Without a target to mock, the crowd settles down and {0.SimFirstName} gets to leave in one piece. Too bad {M0.his}{F0.her} rep takes the hit for the incomplete set.
Best to play it safe. {0.SimFirstName}’s routine goes fine without the joke, and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is none the wiser. Besides, there’s always tomorrow.
Well, the club was empty, but {0.SimFirstName} got in a great practice run and killed the butterflies in {M0.his}{F0.her} stomach. Of course with no one in the audience it’s hard to know which jokes would have gotten laughs…
This is embarrassing. {0.SimFirstName} {M0.splits his pants}{F0. snaps her shoulder strap} the instant {M0.he}{F0.she} sits down at the piano bench, which is made worse by the fact the piano is center stage. The crowd politely pretends not to notice, but {M0.he}{F0.she} will still have to pay a tailor to fix the borrowed {M0.tux}{F0.gown}.
The owner stares and shrugs. “Times are tough,” is all {0.SimFirstName} can get from her. Until she cancels {0.SimFirstName}’s next show, anyway.
Well, that is nice of {0.SimFirstName}. Too bad the old-timer forgets to give the piano bench back, not to mention the bread in the jar. Maybe there’s another piano bar somewhere?
The great thing about launch parties is that companies go all out. After a long night of great food and great music, no one remembers {0.SimFirstName} at all, except the host, who is perfectly happy to sweep the whole thing under the rug.
Whew! That did it. The crowd snaps to attention and even laughs, inspiring {0.SimFirstName} to deliver one of {M0.his}{F0.her} best performances yet.
Sometimes the best thing is to have a little laugh at your own expense. {0.SimFirstName} admits to forgetting and moves on to something {M0.he}{F0.she} does remember, saving {M0.his}{F0.her} act and rep.
Perseverance pays off! Suddenly the section clicks. There’s no stopping {0.SimFirstName} now!
Well, that didn’t go well. Instead of praising {0.SimFirstName} for caring enough to call, he berates {M0.him}{F0.her} for being a fake and pulls the ad. The silver lining? The client keeps quiet to protect his own rep, which protects {0.SimFirstName}’s as well.
{0.SimFirstName} walks out, but the fans don’t follow. After all, they kinda like this club. Where’s all that {M0.fangirl}{F0.fanboy} outrage when {M0.he}{F0.she} really needs it?!
Phew! It worked. {0.SimFirstName} gets a big laugh and has won over the crowd. It’s smooth sailing from here.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t make much of a mark on this movie, but it’s always neat to see your name in the credits!
This tack seems to calm the bride for now. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} has been cultivating {M0.his}{F0.her} repertoire. {M0.He}{F0.She} has just enough acceptable material to fill the hour before the bride turns her daggers on the arriving band.
The owner apologizes for the mistake and sheepishly writes {0.SimFirstName} a new check. {0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} comic skills to help her laugh it off.
It seems like everyone is humming {0.SimFirstName}’s tune! Or maybe, it’s the other one…but {0.SimFirstName} likes to believe it’s {M0.his}{F0.hers}. Not many people are buying drills, but the client chalks that up to a glitch in the rotor.
Somebody else alerts the prodigy, and he finds a new shirt in time. His audition is mind-blowing, while {0.SimFirstName}’s is quickly forgotten.
Practice makes perfect. And judging by the audience response, {0.SimFirstName} is closer to practice than perfect. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should have played something a little darker? Suffering goes well with coffee.
The prodigy’s audition is quite impressive, but his disheveled appearance is deemed unsuitable and {0.SimFirstName} wins the spot.
Nothing’s funnier than a roast, when it’s done right. {0.SimFirstName} turns the hack into a real laughing stock and wins the competition.
Nice try. The child throws a wild temper tantrum and the mother shoos the kid’s outside, but not before staring daggers at {0.SimFirstName}. Hey, it’s the kid’s party. He can cry if he wants to.
{0.SimFirstName} just learned one of the most important lessons of live performance. Yelling at angry people just makes them angrier. Where is that back door again?
Well, the payday will be nice, but the corporate crowd could not be less interested in {0.SimFirstName}’s act. Worse, {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is absolutely livid that {0.SimFirstName} backed out of his party at the last second.
Luckily, the cellist thanks {0.SimFirstName}. He’s had a bit of a head cold and was losing focus. They practice the piece again and this time everything sounds beautiful.
Nothing’s worse than a sore loser. The least {0.SimFirstName} could have done is make the accusation funny. The crowd turns hostile, and no amount of “what’s up with so-and-so” jokes can bring them back around.
A stringy kid and his mom ask {0.SimFirstName} if {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} ever considered playing birthday parties. Time to find a backup band!
The bassist is too dazed to notice. {0.SimFirstName} capitalizes on the crowd’s attention by pounding out an epic ballad of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, winning some new fans.
The crowd boos and starts throwing things at the stage. Bombarded by lipsticks and lighters, {0.SimFirstName} beats a hasty retreat backstage, where {M0.he}{F0.she} is promptly fired by the headliner’s manager.
A check is a check. {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t get to hear {M0.his}{F0.her} material on TV, but when the MC’s performance falls flat, {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t take the hit for it, either.
YES! Everyone enjoys {0.SimFirstName}’s well-crafted set, but the gross-out act was very polarizing. That means {0.SimFirstName} gets the win easily.
Wow! {0.SimFirstName} has never had such an enthusiastic crowd. Turns out this assembly of family and friends has a wicked sense of humor! {0.SimFirstName}’s friend is furious to be humiliated at his own wedding, but {0.SimFirstName} has some great new material to play with now.
Lucky for {0.SimFirstName}, the bride turns on the groom instead, who apparently was supposed to send the playlist. Whoops! The groom is awarded a slight reprieve as the photographer arrives to whisk the bride away. For the moment, all is well.
The director refuses. He loves the score as it is now, but he does promise to make sure the credit goes where it belongs: to {0.SimFirstName}’s colleague only.
Silence. {0.SimFirstName} flubbed it! One point, Funny Guy. Zero, {0.SimFirstName}. This is going to be a long night.
Bravo! This wins {0.SimFirstName} big points with the crowd at the bar, and the old pianist repays the favor by referring {0.SimPronounObjective} to a talent-agent connection of his. {0.SimFirstName} leaves with stars in {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes.
The exec throws a temper tantrum, but no one seems to notice or care. They keep {0.SimFirstName}’s version and play it for the company at a team meeting. {M0.He}{F0.She} stills hears people humming it to themselves as {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves the building.
Well, it turns out to be an okay party. After another round of polite conversation, someone turns on some music and things pick up. {0.SimFirstName}’s friend seems happy.
This pack is a little too good at sniffing out the truth. As eyes start to narrow, {0.SimFirstName} starts to stutter and forgets the few ideas {M0.he}{F0.she} came up with on the way. {M0.He}{F0.She} cuts the intro short and gets on with the bidding. Hopefully {M0.his}{F0.her} employers won’t notice!
{0.SimFirstName} nails it! Why, the gag is even funnier than it was before. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to write that one down before {M0.he}{F0.she} forgets it.
Wow, what great friends {0.SimFirstName} has! EVERYONE was there. Too bad NO ONE laughed. But still, great friends!
Nice! {0.SimFirstName} gets him good! Who’s laughing now, Clownface?
The director agrees and changes the script. {0.SimFirstName}’s jokes get the best laughs, and the MC brings in a few more for kicks. {0.SimFirstName} is only credited as “additional writers,” but hey, {M0.he}{F0.she} was on TV, sort of.
{0.SimFirstName}’s fans rally behind {M0.him}{F0.her}. One fan invites {0.SimFirstName} to play in his basement, and another promises a full-page article in a small zine. Too bad the buzz among club managers isn’t nearly as friendly.
Well, it’s always nice to be nice. Who knows who’s watching? The prodigy thanks {0.SimFirstName} for the tip, but then promises to bury {M0.him}{F0.her} in the audition. Yikes!
Everyone is too Dazed and distracted to notice or care. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} could probably just play the same note continuously for 20 minutes and still go unremarked.
{0.SimFirstName} matches the other comic in grossness, but unfortunately that means {M0.he}{F0.she} fails to stand out. The judges wind up flipping a coin and gives the win to {0.SimFirstName}!
What was {0.SimFirstName} thinking? This is advertising, not the Music Awards. The VP throws a fit and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} rewrite it, using “piddle” in at least 4 places. And that’s just the 15-second cut!
The jingle is worse, but the VP is happy. Happy clients means more work for {0.SimFirstName}, and that’s more important than creative fulfillment, right?
When {0.SimFirstName} returns for {M0.his}{F0.her} second set, the club is closed and no one seems to know where the owner went. Doesn’t look like she plans to come back, either...
Everyone is too Dazed and distracted to notice or care. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} could probably just play the same note continuously for 20 minutes and still go unremarked.
Kudos to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.His}{F0.Her} fingers fly up and down the frets, weaving a tune that blends seamlessly into the bassist’s wild solo. The crowd goes absolutely wild over the unexpected team-up. What a great show!
Nobody blames {0.SimFirstName}. In fact they all look a little relieved. {0.SimFirstName} helps {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to a plate of lukewarm food and calls it a day.
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend hears what {M0.he}{F0.she} passed up to perform at the party, and is very grateful. He pumps everyone up and makes sure {0.SimFirstName} has a great crowd to perform to. It’s one of {M0.his}{F0.her} best shows!
Nice try. The host snatches the mic before {0.SimFirstName} can make a worse mess. {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation is going to take a pretty bad hit over this.
Who knew {0.SimFirstName}’s friend could be so sensitive? He starts shouting insults back, airing a bit of {0.SimFirstName}’s dirty laundry. A few couples leave before the bouncer escorts the friend to the door.
The act just needed a little push! {0.SimFirstName} has really got everyone laughing now, and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend looks happy. At least someone at this party has personality!
A famous celebrity in the crowd couldn’t help but voice their opinion of how terrible {0.SimFirstName}’s act is. Loudly. It isn’t long until everyone in the audience is murmuring.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with the music {0.SimFirstName} has been playing, but now that {M0.he}{F0.she} has accepted the blame, it seems all wrong to the bride. {0.SimFirstName} is fired on the spot.
Well, the good news is, {0.SimFirstName}'s friend is still speaking to {M0.him}{F0.her}. But no one in the audience cracked a smile, and everyone keeps asking, &quot;Oh, was that you?&quot; when {M0.he}{F0.she} asks them about the speech later.
The producer is happy and {0.SimFirstName} gets a pretty decent check, for a vegetable. The ad is completely forgettable and gets pulled early.
Shouting throws {0.SimFirstName}’s rhythm off, and the librarian impressions fall a little flat. But {0.SimFirstName} gets warm applause for trying.
{0.SimFirstName} soon has everyone cracking up and the rough cut they put together looks great. The ad should be a hit. {0.SimFirstName} just hopes that when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets on stage now, people don’t shout, “Hey, it’s the cauliflower!”
The host is not happy, but the show must go on-and at least it won’t involve a wardrobe malfunction. The host has the caterers rearrange some large ferns, shielding {0.SimFirstName} from view. And recognition.
Phew! Whatever was happening during rehearsal doesn’t repeat itself during the first performance. The master cellist has lost a little of his luster in {0.SimFirstName}’s eyes, but the concert goes fine.
Oops! {0.SimFirstName} remembers the right line right after the wrong one trips out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. People are laughing-but at {0.SimPronounObjective}, not with {0.SimPronounObjective}.
It works! A crowd starts to gather and clap to the music. One couple even attempts to dance to it. Of course, nobody knows who on earth {0.SimFirstName} is, but hey, they like {M0.his}{F0.her} music!
Well played! After an hour of dabbing the keys with {M0.cotton boxer briefs}{F0.a jewelry cloth}, the piano sounds as good as new. It took a little work, but {0.SimFirstName} is able to avoid a costly repair.
{0.SimFirstName} made the right call! The kid crams for the heist in one afternoon, over ten cups of coffee, then pulls a successful job—and even swings the getaway car past a diner to grab {0.SimFirstName} a Reuben!
Hey, that old lady could be somebody's grandma! {0.SimFirstName} decides to show an elder a little respect. Anybody got a problem with that?
Ah. It appears a dog walker has left {0.SimFirstName}... holding the bag. That is unfortunate!
Looks like {0.SimFirstName} bagged a sweet deal. Cold! Hard! Cash!
Give the Raise
Test Him First
The armored car plows right through {0.SimFirstName}'s road block and keeps going, leaving behind nothing but dark, curving skid marks, reminiscent of so many abstract paint trails.
The armored car is run off the road and the driver easily gives up the painting. (&quot;Looks like something my kid would make!&quot;) Now this masterpiece can be enjoyed by the highest bidder instead of a bunch of freeloading tourists. Success!
Even a petty thief has standards. {0.SimFirstName} decides it's better to save those bag snatching skills for more promising briefcases and fancy purses.
Drill Safe
Interrogate Manager
{0.SimFirstName}'s crew is a well-oiled machine. The veteran crooks make up for Sammy's absence and pull a flawless job!
{0.SimFirstName}'s crew is good, but you never know what can happen when you make last second changes to the plan. Without Sammy on lookout, the cops interrupt the crew mid-heist and they barely escape.
Surprise Attack!
Sneak On By
Hey, look, {0.SimFirstName} has stumbled across some photos of the trash talker riding a pony, while dressed as a fox—with a princess tiara and fairy wings. Enjoy the new meme, internet!
{0.SimFirstName} can't break through the encryption. Argh! Whoever heard of a troll that actually knows what he's talking about? {0.SimFirstName} shouldn't have wasted the time.

After some intense interrogation, the codes are surrendered to {0.SimFirstName}. Who knew that bank managers were so ticklish? Time to open that vault!
At the first threat of violence, the bank manager faints right to the floor. Really, bank manager?? There's no way for {0.SimFirstName} to get the codes in time now.
{0.SimFirstName} should have done a little more research! {M0.He}{F0.She} accidentally leaves the museum with a fingerpainting made by the curator's kid!
{0.SimFirstName} sneaks into the museum during a shift change,  exchanging the famous work with a kindergarten painting from a kid down the block. No one notices!
{0.SimFirstName} to Triangle: &quot;Who sent you?&quot; Triangle to {0.SimFirstName}: &quot;What is the sound of one hand hacking?&quot; Gasp! It's the mentor The Oracle has been waiting for! {0.SimFirstName} joins forces with Triangle on the ultimate mission: toppling the entire Internet!
The Oracle receives an automated response from Triangle Life Insurance. It was spam. Sad face.
Leaving a trail of sparks dancing across the blacktop, {0.SimFirstName} expertly manuevers the crippled vehicle back to the safehouse at full speed.
Now {0.SimFirstName} has a flat tire and a bent axle. The crew is forced to abandon the vehicle (and some of the loot) to continue the getaway on foot.
Aw! Look at that big old guard, sleeping like a baby. {0.SimFirstName} caught him by surprise and he never had a chance. Someone should tell that guard that being &quot;The Muscle&quot; isn't just about muscle!
Huh. Guess that nerve pinch move only works on TV. Something for {0.SimFirstName} to think about while {M0.he}{F0.she} runs away from the enraged guard!

{0.SimFirstName} might be in a little trouble with the boss, but {M0.he}{F0.she} never does a job on the fly. {M0.He}{F0.She} only does a fly job. That reputation and record of success takes careful planning.
Turns out the old lady didn't get into her 80s without some serious survival skills. With her walker and surprising strength she knocks {0.SimFirstName} into the street in front of the other thugs. Bye bye, street cred!
{0.SimFirstName} convinces the old woman to pay to have the shoes shined and re-scaled. And now the other thugs know that NOBODY gets a free pass from {0.SimFirstName}!

Oh, no! {0.SimFirstName} left {M0.his}{F0.her} cell phone on full volume! Not only has {M0.he}{F0.she} given away {M0.his}{F0.her} position, but now the guard is making fun of {M0.his}{F0.her} ringtone.
Being &quot;The Muscle&quot; isn't just about muscle--{0.SimFirstName} knows that. With surprising skill, {M0.he}{F0.she} slips stealthily by the guard to the target entrance. Looks like this job will go off without a hitch!

They don’t call {0.SimFirstName} a master blender for nothing. Expertly pairing the mystery bean’s qualities with a dashingly bold, dark-chocolate rainforest roast, {0.SimFirstName} blends up the ultimate crowd pleaser, which {M0.he}{F0.she} titles “{0.SimFirstName} Surprise”. No one asks who {0.SimFirstName} is, but {M0.he}{F0.she}’s almost sure {M0.his}{F0.her} manager knows.
{0.SimFirstName} scrubs and scrapes uselessly at the carafe. The second {M0.his}{F0.her} manager goes on break, the carafe goes in the trash. Of course the manager finds it later and decides that {0.SimFirstName} can pull extra trash duty since that’s {M0.his}{F0.her} preferred method of cleaning up.
Daringly pairing the mystery bean’s sweet-and-sour aromas with a dashingly bold, dark-chocolate rainforest roast, {0.SimFirstName} concocts a truly original blend {M0.he}{F0.she} names “{0.SimFirstName} Surprise”. It tastes as bad as it sounds. Customers demand a refund. Nobody asks who {0.SimFirstName} is, but unfortunately, {M0.his}{F0.her} manager knows.
{0.SimFirstName} scrubs and scrapes, hands pruning in water so tepid the bacteria must consider it a pool party. After 60 stomach-turning minutes, {M0.he}{F0.she} finally sees {M0.his}{F0.her} own green face shining forth from the carafe. {M0.His}{F0.Her} manager would be very impressed, if he hadn’t left a while back.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. {0.SimFirstName} brews up some joe from the mystery bean, labels it “Midnight Magic” and slaps an Organic! sticker on the sign. Customer after customer orders a cup, raving about it being “so unique” and “almost spicy.” When {M0.his}{F0.her} manager comes back from his break, he tastes it, erases the sign and scribbles “Decaf.” 
{0.SimFirstName} decides it’s best to give the man what he ordered. {M0.He}{F0.She} carefully measures, froths, dollops and serves, presenting the boss with a perfect classic latte. The boss nods and smiles his first smile, prompting a thumbs-up from {0.SimFirstName}’s manager.
{0.SimFirstName} has been training for this moment {M0.his}{F0.her} entire career. An extra smidge of espresso, slightly thicker foam and then the masterpiece—not just a milky pattern, but a towering 3D foam crocus! Delighted, the boss sips it…and loves it! {0.SimFirstName} is going places now…
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. {0.SimFirstName} brews up a fresh pot, labeling it “Midnight Magic” and slapping an Organic! sticker on the sign. Customer after customer orders a cup, only to dump it out and demand a different refill. When {M0.his}{F0.her} manager comes back from break, he tastes it, dumps the pot and asks for Java Lamp.
{0.SimFirstName} has been training for this moment {M0.his}{F0.her} entire career. An extra smidge of espresso, slightly thicker foam and then the masterpiece—not just a pattern, but a towering 3D foam crocus…that flops onto the boss’ §600 tie. Maybe {0.SimFirstName} has a little more training to do after all…
Scrub It Clean
Throw It Out
End of Day Cleaning
{0.SimFirstName} is just about to hang up {M0.his}{F0.her} spiffy white apron when {M0.his}{F0.her} manager nods toward the sink. There’s an old steel carafe that’s been rotting there since the Dark Ages. Inside, burnt moldy coffee laps gray, gluey froth. Cleaning it will take forever (and be unspeakably gross). Tossing it out, however… 
New Beans
{0.SimFirstName} is contentedly grinding {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite blends—Java Lamp and Captain John’s Cleanse—when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a new variety of bean in the shipment. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes a whiff, noting the caramel overtones and approachable aroma beneath. There’s no label. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} brew a batch, or try mixing it with something else?
Career Opportunity
Whoa. The corporate boss has just arrived at {0.SimFirstName}’s café and is ordering a latte. He’s distracted, frowning and listening to the manager, hardly glancing at {0.SimFirstName} while placing his order. Of course, {0.SimFirstName} could make sure he notices. Serve him something extra special. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could play it safe and make a regular old latte.

Ellie is furious at getting the Time Out and screams that they’re for babies. Dropping the paint, she starts throwing toys, stuffed animals, books. {0.SimFirstName} will be lucky to get her calm, clean and into her pj’s before her parents get back, not to mention tackling this terrible mess…  
{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath and tries reasoning with the child-turned-dervish. Ellie drops the paint, glares wickedly and starts throwing toys, stuffed animals, books. At this rate {0.SimFirstName} will be lucky to get her calm, clean and into her pj’s before her parents get back. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s already decided they can deal with the mess… 
{0.SimFirstName} explains that {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t like this game, and asks Ellie to tell {M0.him}{F0.her} when she’s done so they can clean up. {M0.He}{F0.She} steps outside. A second later, Ellie comes out, eyes down, lip out. They wash the walls. A hot bath and a few books later, she’s contentedly dreaming in her bed.
Now that {0.SimFirstName} has explained it, the girls have agreed that taking turns is fair. The only problem is who goes first. “My turn,” one shouts. “No, MINE.” The bigger girl yanks the doll so hard the head pops right off the body. “It’s dead. You killed it!” they wail. {0.SimFirstName}’s supervisor comes running.
{0.SimFirstName} takes the doll away until the girls agree to share. One girl shoves the other. “See what you did? It was mine.” During the ensuing shoving match, the bigger girl yanks the doll back so hard its head pops off. “It’s dead! You killed it!” they wail at {0.SimFirstName}. {M0.His}{F0.Her} supervisor comes running.
Ellie is furious about the Time Out, but it works. After a few minutes of pouting, she helps {0.SimFirstName} wash off the walls. A hot bath and a few books later, she’s contentedly dreaming in her bed. Luckily, her parents are more embarrassed than angry, and very relieved that {0.SimFirstName}’s willing to come again.
Wow. Charlie has a serious set of lungs for a 4-year-old. {0.SimFirstName} practically has to force feed him the green glop, with the boy eyeing his cookie prize the entire time. Three tantrums, one dinner, and one cookie later, he finally goes to bed, grumbling about “the worst sitter in the world.”
{0.SimFirstName} takes the doll away and explains that neither girl gets it if they can’t share. Tears well in both girls’ eyes, and then one shoves the other. “See what you did? It was mine.” “No, mine.” “MINE.” {0.SimFirstName} quickly interrupts the shoving match with Music Time! Three verses into Old MacDonald, and all is happily forgotten. Nice!
{0.SimFirstName} looks at the green glop on the boy’s plate and sighs. If anyone deserves a cookie, it’s Charlie. {M0.He}{F0.She} hands over the cookie, but Charlie has to PROMISE to eat a full meal afterward. Charlie nods, swallows the cookie, and hardly touches his dinner. But he goes to bed happy!
This is going pretty well! Now that {0.SimFirstName} has explained it, the girls have agreed that taking turns is fair. The only problem is who goes first. {0.SimFirstName} chooses the meaner girl. “That’s life,” mutters the meek one. So many lessons being learned!

Sharing Lessons
{0.SimFirstName} is happily watching some children play Family when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears screaming from inside the playhouse. Two girls have hold of the same baby doll and are tugging and screaming at each other. {0.SimFirstName} knows this is a “teaching moment”—the perfect opportunity for a lesson about sharing. So, how do you teach that again?
Charlie's Dessert
{0.SimFirstName} is babysitting for a new family, dolloping Quinoa and Kale Delight (“Charlie’s favorite!”) onto a dinner plate and sweetly ignoring the crashing sounds from the boy’s bedroom when suddenly it’s quiet. {M0.His}{F0.Her} heart skips. Then a small voice asks, “Can I have a cookie?” Charlie is not supposed to have ANY cookies until after dinner.
Painting the Walls
{0.SimFirstName} goes to get little Ellie ready for bed. {M0.He}{F0.She} calls. No answer. Opens her door. Oh no. Red, blue and a mysterious brown over every wall. On her face, in her hair, flying from her fingers. {0.SimFirstName} begs her to stop but she just screams, “NO!!” {0.SimFirstName} isn’t supposed to give Time Outs, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has to do something…
{0.SimFirstName}’s team brings home some fine data points, but was the mission really worth the expense? The agency honchos are considering scrapping worthless little missions like this, which aren’t worth anyone’s time. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s paid to clean, not question authority. But after the second time the shuttle comes back with strange damage and markings, the bosses start to notice. Turns out the astronauts have been taking the shuttle on joyrides, and {0.SimFirstName} could have put a stop to it if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} spoken up earlier.
Although {0.SimFirstName} tries to steer carefully, an asteroid crashes into the side of the ship. Not only is the paint job ruined, but there might be a huge hole, too. {M0.He}{F0.She} has to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} mission short and return to base early. 
{0.SimFirstName} searches for the origin of the sound…and eventually discovers that it’s nothing but an old, busted radio in an abandoned spacecraft. {M0.He}{F0.She} wasted a ton of time and fuel for nothing. 
With a full night’s sleep, {0.SimFirstName} can employ expert-level test-taking strategies and do some critical thinking. {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to pass the test with a fairly decent grade, despite not actually knowing anything.
The senior officer gets furious when {0.SimFirstName} refuses to obey his command, but in a few seconds it’s clear that the situation is under control. It was just a light bulb out, not a fuel emergency. The senior officer praises {0.SimFirstName} for cool thinking in a crisis.
Outside the venue, some fans get a little grabby with the singer, but that’s not {0.SimFirstName}’s problem.  A few citizens praise {M0.him}{F0.her} for refusing to subsidize celebrities with public resources.
“Stop asking so many questions,” says {0.SimFirstName}’s boss. Where the shuttle went and who was on it and what stars they may or may not have blown up are of no concern of {0.SimFirstName}’s.
{0.SimFirstName} straps {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into the pod and blasts off, headed straight for terra firma. As {M0.he}{F0.she} looks into the rearview mirror, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the ship explode! {M0.He}{F0.She} got out just in time. 
{0.SimFirstName} leaves the suspect handcuffed at a Space Gas station, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back from the hijacking scene all that’s left are the cuffs and the lingering smell of gas and failure. The guy’s long gone, and {0.SimFirstName} has lots of paperwork to do to explain why.
Money is nice, but so is sleeping soundly at night. {0.SimFirstName} isn’t scared of getting {M0.his}{F0.her} hands a little dirty, but this space gangster is legitimately a maniac. It isn’t worth it. {0.SimFirstName} passes on the job.
It's not a popular move, but it's good business! {0.SimFirstName} makes a killing on the skins, which gives {M0.him}{F0.her} a little room to invest in some even more exotic inventory.
Customers respect that {0.SimFirstName} didn't cheat them. Even once the current craze for Snyxskin is over, they'll keep coming back to {0.SimFirstName} for all their exotic goods needs.
{M0.He}{F0.She} installs the system once it’s approved, but the pilots love it so much that they’re angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for not doing it sooner! Just can’t win for losing in this place. 
It takes much of {M0.his}{F0.her} potable water and {M0.his}{F0.her} best space pillow, but {0.SimFirstName} manages to smother the fire. Mission control praises {0.SimPronounObjective} for keeping {M0.his}{F0.her} cool, and rewards {0.SimPronounObjective} with the location of a secret stash of Astronaut Food Stix on board the ship. The mission continues.
A few miscreants protest, but soon the galactic citizens are shaping up. The cleanup campaign’s even got its own adorable advertising mascot: Smoot the Scolding Cephalopoid.

Orbiting the moon has proven a prudent, if boring choice! {0.SimFirstName} will surely join the annals of other Sims who've seen the moon from a closer distance; yes, those nearly brave heroes whose names no one can remember will surely be remembered forevermore.
This has been a terrifying ordeal of deception and malevolence, and {0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn't even WANT to know who's been following {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} heads home as fast as the ship will go.
It was an act of sheer optimism for {0.SimFirstName} to believe {M0.he}{F0.she} could decipher the workings of an alien spacecraft. {M0.He}{F0.She} isn’t very handy with machines anyway. The sun is starting to set and it won’t be safe to stay out any longer. {0.SimFirstName} will have to abandon the search and hope for the best on the flight home.
Approching the crew, it becomes obvious from the look in their eyes that they have contracted space madness! Immediately, the astronauts begins pelting {0.SimFirstName} with food, forcing {M0.him}{F0.her} to flee back to the rocket. {0.SimFirstName} sends a message to command. Hopefully, they know what to do.
{0.SimFirstName} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} pod to go investigate, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets out there {M0.he}{F0.she} can't remember what {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to be doing. As it turns out, one of the symptoms of Space Madness is short-term memory loss. Bored, {0.SimFirstName} simply goes home.
With {0.SimFirstName}’s help, Hiattooine's food replicators begin launching non-grilled cheese—at hyperspeed! The Rebel forces are soon buried in disgusting sandwiches. {0.SimFirstName} is arrested along with them, and is forced to hand over the landing stabilizers on the rocket to secure {M0.his}{F0.her} release.
The only thing {0.SimFirstName} catches from the muck is a swamp-borne disease. The trial is over, and the creature will not help {M0.him}{F0.her}. The only option now is to fire up the engines and go for full burn to clear the swamp. There’s no telling what damage that could do to the ship, though....
{0.SimFirstName} cautiously inspects the hat with an outstretched arm.  Who knows; it could have space-lice!  Murmurs through the crowd indicate that something is amiss.  They think {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t know how a hat works!  Before a rapid donning can ameliorate the confusion, {0.SimFirstName} is zapped back onto {F0.her}{M0.his} spaceship, which is already cruising towards home.
Bad things happen when a person consumes 17 packages of astronaut mashed potatoes. But wait - {0.SimFirstName}'s slowly starting to feel sharper, more clear-headed…why did {M0.he}{F0.she} do so many weird things? {M0.He}{F0.She} must have had Space Madness! In case it comes back, {0.SimFirstName} heads for home immediately.
As {0.SimFirstName} cruises deeper into space, the pressure differential causes a warping of {M0.his}{F0.her} brain's equilibrium centers. In short, {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness is cured! By science! {M0.He}{F0.She} realizes how bizarre {0.SimFirstName} been acting and flags a passing ship for help returning home.
{0.SimFirstName} opens the fuel valve and watches all {M0.his}{F0.her} propellant trickle out. Soon, the engines sputter and die. Now {M0.he's}{F0.she's} floating through deep space with no way to get home. The rocket automatically activates its distress beacon. Hopefully a friendly ship will stop by and give {0.SimFirstName} a tow…and some fresh oxygen.
{0.SimFirstName} really has been meaning to polish up on {M0.his}{F0.her} social skills. The little creature takes great offense to {0.SimFirstName}’s pleas. Suddenly, all of the creatures in the camp begin to hiss. They draw tiny but vicious-looking blades. This planet isn’t safe anymore. It’s not ideal, but {0.SimFirstName} will have to attempt the flight home without a new catalyzer!
Wrong! The panel shuts down and the door won't open. {0.SimFirstName} has no choice but to drift aimlessly and hope a passing ship tows {M0.him}{F0.her} back home…
Why slow down now? {0.SimFirstName} accelerates past the red—but without thrusters {M0.his}{F0.her} engine bursts into flames. The cops tow {0.SimPronounObjective} back to the station, where they charge {0.SimPronounObjective} for alien-napping and endangering a minor. Hopefully {0.SimFirstName} can escape and make it back home from here…
{0.SimFirstName}'s oxygen is down to fumes when a trader ship passes by and detects the signal from the beacon. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} saved! The ship's alien cook makes {M0.him}{F0.her} something like a grilled cheese while the ship's mechanic fixes the hull breach with his terrible foreclaws. Looks like {0.SimFirstName} lives to explore another day!
{0.SimFirstName} fires an ion blast at the creature’s stash of rocks—and misses! Grinning from ear to pointy green ear, the alien chortles, catches an asteroid in the phase beam and hurls it at {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, cracking a tail panel. He’s reaching for another as {0.SimFirstName} blasts away at top speed. Hopefully, the ship can still land…
The pain spirits will be forestalled by the spastic gyrations of the dance, or so {0.SimFirstName} thinks. Through sheer luck {M0.his}{F0.her} random flailing actually activates the ship's emergency beacon. A rescue crew soon shows up to tow {0.SimFirstName} back into {M0.his}{F0.her} home orbit.
{0.SimFirstName} drops everything and runs! Dozens of spider-like aliens descend on {0.SimPronounObjective} and carry {0.SimPronounObjective}, roughly, back to the ship. An alien technician climbs aboard and programs something. {0.SimFirstName} finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} rocketing toward home, hoping {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel will somehow last...
&quot;No worries, dude,&quot; says the alien. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes, but promises to help out next time. As {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts off for home, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the alien forlornly playing his didgeridoo as he fades into the distance. {0.SimFirstName} might want to consider getting that expanded cargo bay.
{0.SimFirstName} runs to the ship, but the pain in {M0.his}{F0.her} side is unbearable. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s not fast enough. As the rocket door opens, a nightmare in black fur pounces on {0.SimPronounObjective}! It’s all teeth and claws until {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to scramble into the ship. The wounds can be dressed, but {0.SimFirstName} will have to fly home without the catalyzer.
Ignoring the computer, {0.SimFirstName} manages to manually connect the dynotherms. {M0.He}{F0.She} always was good with machines! The error message clears. Now {0.SimFirstName} should be able to pilot the ship back home safely.
Unfortunately, the police captain's no idiot. When {0.SimFirstName} turns on the charm, that only makes the officer more suspicious. The police find and confiscate the contraband, giving {0.SimFirstName} a stern warning to keep away from alien riff-raff. Relieved and refueled, {0.SimFirstName} blasts off for home.
Diplomacy first, {0.SimFirstName} always says, but this time it ain’t happening. The instant {M0.he}{F0.she} lands on the yellow moon, {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship is surrounded by a mob of angry-looking colonists. They rock &quot;the government {M0.man's}{F0.woman's}&quot; rocket back and forth until it falls over, and race to their fighter ships. {0.SimFirstName} hopes {M0.he}{F0.she} can still get home safely.
Though {0.SimFirstName} pushes really, REALLY hard, the triangular hole fails to accept the ball. Jeers erupt from the crowd, as the spectating beings exchange both sideways glances and lost wagers. Abruptly, {0.SimFirstName} is zapped back onto {M0.his}{F0.her} spaceship, already cruising towards home.
Red lights flash and klaxons blare as the ship prepares to obliterate itself. Then everything goes calm, and with a small &quot;ping&quot; an error message appears. Apparently the drivers on the ship's Self Destruct need to be updated. Carefully clicking “Not Now,” {0.SimFirstName} vows to run a full system update as soon as {M0.he}{F0.she}'s safely back home.
{0.SimFirstName} recalls a nifty trick. Pursing {M0.his}{F0.her} lips, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets out a shrill alien mating cry. The egomaniac pilot turns 1 eye on the horizon and 1 on his mirror, but his 3rd eye spots {0.SimPronounObjective} coming! The alien dodges {0.SimFirstName}’s fire as the clock runs out. Telling {0.SimPronounObjective} to focus on upgrades, not stunts, the alien leaves {0.SimFirstName} to skulk home.
Luckily the police captain seems to be into {0.SimFirstName}. The cop believes {0.SimFirstName}'s story and takes the contraband without further questioning. The captain also rewards {0.SimFirstName} with a small stack of cash and a personal comm number--just in case {0.SimFirstName} needs anything. *Wink!*
{0.SimFirstName} fires {F0.her}{M0.his} ship's blasters, which bounce harmlessly off the surface of the creature. Oops. The creature slams into the ship, sending it careening. {0.SimFirstName} limps away back to home, with some bruises...
Sunset Valley, we have a problem! Like a poor-man's Icarus, {0.SimFirstName} flew too close to the moon, and has slingshot {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket up to perilous reentry speeds! {F0.She}{M0.He} should come plummeting home any minute now.
{0.SimFirstName} is attempting to take one small step, but for unknown reasons is unable to take that step. Stomping, waving {M0.his}{F0.her} arms, and shouting at the sky, though standard protocol, are proving ineffectual. It appears a small rock is in the way! {0.SimFirstName} cannot reach the surface.
After entering the wrong code too many times, {M0.he's}{F0.she's} locked out. {0.SimFirstName} sulks, complaining about enemy agents and hidden messages being broadcast in {M0.his}{F0.her} TV. But wait - those things aren't real! The Space Madness finally seems to be passing! {0.SimFirstName} realizes how irrational {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been and heads for home before another attack hits.
This space walk is going to be amazing! {0.SimFirstName} puts on {M0.his}{F0.her} suit - along with its auxiliary air tank. After a few minutes of breathing clean air, {M0.he}{F0.she} regains {M0.his}{F0.her} sanity and realizes what happened. {M0.He}{F0.She} decides to stay in the suit and just head for home. Luckily {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't do anything too crazy!
As {0.SimFirstName} blasts off home, {M0.he}{F0.she} assures {M0.himself}{F0.herself} that it was probably for the best. Racing can be dangerous without upgraded gear … though {M0.he}{F0.she} could definitely use that prize money.
{0.SimFirstName} gets a lock on Red Tooth and fires, but the shot glances limply off the TS-555. Without better cannons, the most {M0.he}{F0.she} can hope to do to Red Tooth is irritate him. Snarling, Red Tooth rams {0.SimFirstName} off the track, damaging part of {M0.his}{F0.her} left wing. It’s gonna be a rough flight back.
The guard seizes {0.SimFirstName} and injects {0.SimPronounObjective} anyway. When {0.SimFirstName} wakes up, {M0.he}{F0.she} is on the asphalt next to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound is locked, and the only response to {M0.his}{F0.her} knocks is a lot of barking. Looks like it’s time to pack this mission in.
{0.SimFirstName} knows exactly what to toss through that window: {M0.his}{F0.her} helmet!! The window is jarred from its frame but the pressure change starts sucking everything out of the cabin! Luckily a replacement window gets wedged into the hole and seals it. The ship automatically cycles in the reserve air and {0.SimFirstName}'s head finally clears. Better get home for repairs!
Rookie mistake! Without upgraded thrusters, {0.SimFirstName}’s ship can’t be pushed to those kinds of limits. Suddenly {M0.his}{F0.her} ship rattles violently and all systems sputter out! Spinning off the track, {M0.he}{F0.she} smashes into an asteroid. Luckily, the damage seems fixable, but it’ll be rough getting home.
{0.SimFirstName} points out {M0.he}{F0.she} could already be in trouble for alien-napping and stays {M0.his}{F0.her} course, assuming the little orange guy won’t have the guts to ask twice. Sure enough, the creature stays silent. Once they land, it quietly uncuffs {0.SimPronounObjective}, but smashes a panel angrily on its way out. Might be a rough flight home…
{0.SimFirstName} gathers up some random garbage and debris and ejects it out into space. Now the area is littered with empty bottles and cellophane wrappers. That'll throw 'em off the scent. Quite pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} smarts and ingenuity, {0.SimFirstName} heads home.
{0.SimFirstName} has just enough fuel to safely make it back home. Along the way, {M0.his}{F0.her} head starts clearing and the Space Madness starts lifting a bit. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks back on the past several hours…this was a really, really strange trip.
The wiring in this ship is almost definitely sending messages to the government. But now that it's all pulled out, the ship won't run! Oops. Still better than letting the men in trench coats start reading {M0.his}{F0.her} thoughts. {0.SimFirstName} is alone with {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness as {M0.he}{F0.she} waits for someone to tow {0.SimPronounObjective} back home...
Phew! The cops believe {0.SimFirstName} and take {M0.his}{F0.her} little orange buddy home. Now {0.SimFirstName} can head home {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and wonder how a simple trip to the Flea Market got so out of control!
Every light in {0.SimFirstName}'s cockpit is flashing, and every siren is blaring - the cargo is just too much! {0.SimFirstName} jettisons the extra poundage into space - the trader's going to be furious, but hopefully it helps {0.SimFirstName} make re-entry without any catastrophes...
It takes a while for {0.SimFirstName} to get the alien’s attention, but once {M0.he}{F0.she} does, the alien is quite reasonable about things. This seems to be his species' version of golf? Claiming he didn’t know it would mess up communication, he hands over his space rocks and goes on his way.
If {0.SimFirstName} thought the alien looked merry before, now {F0.she's}{M0.he's} in for the real special. Grinning from pointy green ear to pointy green ear, the creature chortles, catches another asteroid in the phase beam, and hurls it at {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, cracking a tail panel. He's reaching for another as {0.SimFirstName} blasts away at top speed. Hopefully, {M0.he}{F0.she} can still land....
{0.SimFirstName} finally staggers back to the ship, exhausted. Smacking the beast with a makeshift club had only made it angrier, and {0.SimFirstName} wound up leading it on quite a merry chase. {M0.He}{F0.She} finally managed to lose it, but the alien ship part was lost as well. Now to attempt the flight home without it…
Thank goodness {0.SimFirstName} brought that bottle of juice! {M0.He}{F0.She} chugs it down to help with the pain. But a strange thing happens…the juice counteracts {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness, and {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes lucid again! {0.SimFirstName} has discovered the cure for Space Madness! {M0.He}{F0.She} heads home, wondering if there is any way to patent fruit juice!
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't know what happens to people who stick around in situations like this, because those people are all dead. {M0.He'd}{F0.She'd} really prefer not to be one of them, so {M0.he}{F0.she} hops into {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket and blasts off before this turns into a bad horror movie.
One swift kick from {0.SimFirstName}'s moon boot, and the alien flies into the airlock, where it is ejected into deep space. As it floats away, it makes some very rude gestures. Well, that kind of attitude certainly has no place on {0.SimFirstName}'s ship!
Out in the blackness of deep space, {0.SimFirstName}'s body starts reacting to the pressure differential microscopically. The pressure vortex actually equalizes {0.SimFirstName}'s brain waves! The Space Madness is gone! {M0.He's}{F0.She's} clear-headed again and sets a course for home. This time, {M0.he}{F0.she} locks the ship into autopilot, just in case.
While the little creature is looking the other way {0.SimFirstName} reaches for the part, but as soon as {M0.he}{F0.she} touches it, a small, scaly hand grabs {M0.his}{F0.hers}! Slowly, the creature looks back at {0.SimFirstName} and hisses. The other creatures in the camp hiss and draw lethal-looking blades. No choice! {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to make a run for it and fly home without the part!
After breathing from the rescue tank for a few minutes, {0.SimFirstName} feels clearer and less crazy. That was close. And if {M0.he}{F0.she} goes back to breathing regular air, the symptoms will just come back, so {0.SimFirstName} decides to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} trip short and head back home early.
{0.SimFirstName} always has been a good talker, and lies are easier when they contain a smidgen of truth. Explaining about the broken GPS, {M0.he}{F0.she} leads the spider-like creatures toward {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. Sure enough, the screen is still black. Muttering, an alien technician climbs aboard and slams it 3 times. Magic! {0.SimFirstName} enters {M0.his}{F0.her} home coordinates and clears out fast.
&quot;Another trick!&quot; {0.SimFirstName} thinks as the gems glitter and sparkle, tantalizingly close. The alien beings look at each other in confusion. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} not know the value of what is being presented? A buzzer, unmistakingly indicating failure, sounds, and {0.SimFirstName} is zapped abruptly back onto {F0.her}{M0.his} spaceship, no riches to be had.
{0.SimFirstName} turns {M0.his}{F0.her} ship around and hightails it out of there. Maybe it would be better to study the creature some more before attempting to talk to it.
No time to waste! The black hole is already sucking {0.SimFirstName}’s rocketship toward certain destruction. Securing the alien ship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, {M0.he}{F0.she} crosses {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers and pulls. Argh! The force is too strong. The cable snaps and a piece is torn from {0.SimFirstName}’s rocket. {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts {M0.his}{F0.her} engines again and escapes, but landing will be another story...
Armed with a gallon of Chartreuse Charm and some wadded-up toilet paper, {0.SimFirstName} gets to work painting. But after inhaling the fumes for a few minutes a weird thing happens - {M0.he}{F0.she} feels the Space Madness lifting! While in {M0.his}{F0.her} moment of lucidity, {M0.he}{F0.she} charts a course for home and locks in the autopilot!
{0.SimFirstName} is a pro at putting {M0.his}{F0.her} butt into butt-reception areas! {F0.She}{M0.He} sits down without incident, and the crowd goes wild! But they’re not cheering, they’re laughing. The pedestal/chair/{0.SimFirstName} ensemble sinks into the floor just like the other tests! {0.SimFirstName} is swallowed by the machination, dumped unceremoniously into {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket, and blasted home. What a mean trick!
{0.SimFirstName} puts together… something… from a collection of random parts around the station. Unfortunately, the only thing it produces is a sparky surprise and the faint smell of burning. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes and uses the rocket's radio to call for some real help.
{0.SimFirstName} attempts to manually connect the dynotherms, which causes them to explode magnificently. Parts of the engine that were never meant to be exposed to space are now exposed to space. This could potentially cause problems with re-entry…
They'll never catch {0.SimFirstName}! NEVER!! {M0.He}{F0.She}'ll double back home while they're searching the cosmos. With a clever grin, {0.SimFirstName} sets an orbit around a planet that is completely not {M0.his}{F0.her} homeworld. Hopefully a passing ship will give {0.SimPronounObjective} a tow eventually...
After an hour of searching, {0.SimFirstName} lamely offers up a couple of twigs. The creature shakes his head. “You have failed the trial. Help you, I will not.” The only option now is to fire up the engines and go for full burn to clear the muck. There’s no telling what damage that could do to the ship, though…
{0.SimFirstName} engages Safe Mode and the dynotherms immediately explode out of the ship. That hardly seems safe at all! However, it does clear the error message and that's what's important. Unfortunately, landing with a minor engine breach and no dynotherms is insanely dangerous...
{0.SimFirstName} successfully punches out the window with an old wrench, but the pressure change starts sucking everything out of the cabin! Luckily a replacement window gets wedged into the hole and seals it. Wow! The ship automatically cycles in the reserve air and {0.SimFirstName}'s head finally clears. Better get home for repairs!
There is just enough light left for {0.SimFirstName} to make out a large camp, but whoever was staying here appears to have left for safer shelter. Turning toward the sound of a deep growl, {M0.he}{F0.she} spies a pack of monstrous beasts sniffing the ground not far away. This planet isn’t safe. {0.SimFirstName} decides to attempt the flight home without the replacement part.
Bad news! The probe can't traverse the lunar landscape! Also, it isn't gathering any data! Additionally, it may actually be a space-espresso machine and not a probe at all! Looks like {0.SimFirstName} is going home empty-handed.

Why would you send me this chain letter!? Now I'm going to have bad luck for the next six years if I don't pass it along to another fifty people within 24 hours!
This chain letter you sent me is clearly an elaborate pyramid scheme. Could you please not involve me in such nonsense in the future?
I never realized you were superstitious enough to actually fall for a chain letter. Kindly keep that junk to yourself!

The perfect spot for a bedtime reading lamp, this darling nightstand also adds storage for flashlights and other secret treasures. Two sliding drawers open and close softly, so children won’t awaken their parents when setting traps for the tooth fairy.

The Ultimate
The Ultimate is another celebration of the beauty and utility of the flat surface brought to you by Reclamation Homeware. It is superior over The Penultimate nightstand in that it has an additional drawer.
The Penultimate
The most noble of all the simple machines is obviously the humble surface. Simply by the nature of being flat it gives us so much, has allowed us to evolve from brutal cave clans into the magnificent society we enjoy today. Impossible to improve upon (except for The Ultimate). From Reclamation Homeware.

Captain Rodrigo De Pablo Couch
Princess Cordelia’s 3rd pirate boyfriend, Captain Rodrigo De Pablo, suffered several injuries aboard her submarine. One leg got stuck in a pressurized air hatch, crippling him severely.

The Lil' Jony Sofa (Fake!)
We were under quite a lot of pressure by the Lil' Jony Preservation Society to include a matching sofa to The Lil' Jony living chair. But Lil' Jony never sat on a sofa!

Ocean’s Current Loveseat
Love can be a fickle thing, sweeping in and out as if with the tides, especially when you are royalty. Princess Cordelia designed the Ocean’s Current Loveseat in tender acknowledgment of this truth. Swirling embellishments embrace its occupants: the Princess and her current love.
Mega Loveseat
We had to convince our robots to build a 2-person sofa, as they decided that 3-person sofas were more efficient. They changed their minds once we explained the value of cuddling with someone special and then triggered the override switch on their decision cortex. You can’t teach a robot to love, but you can teach it to build a loveseat!

Polly Wants a Plate Tree
Princess Cordelia’s pirate boyfriends were all quite fond of their parrots. Every time she acquired a new boyfriend, he commissioned a plate in his parrot’s honor. After her final romance withered, the Princess was stuck with a pile of plates, so she put them in a golden tree and hung it on the galley wall. 
Goldora Dove Décor
When you can’t see the sky, you start to miss everything in it: the sun, moon, stars and birds, of course. Longing for the gentle doves that used to alight outside her window, Princess Cordelia sketched these doves to be crafted from bars of gold. The modern version has been cost-reduced and is made of Goldora instead.

Yet each pot is exactly the same!

Retired Mangrove Palms
These palms were born and raised in a sheltered mangrove off the sea. Their days were spent among the fishes and animals, an active participant in the complex ecosystem of their home.

After selecting a trendy pot, they packed up and resettled in a new home—less densely-populated and complete with low-oxygen soil.

Competition is healthy when reaching for the sun. This plot of sunflowers is cunningly designed, allowing each flower to grow up free of the others’ shadow.

Regal Rose Bush

It's Amber!

Symbols of the Watery Moon
&lt;i&gt;This decal was granted for the New Lunar Year of the Pig, starting in February 2019.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe Moon is known to be a trickster, always changing its visage, but sometimes it has its moments.\n\nTaking a short break from the New Lunar Year celebration, the Pig looked out one of the grand hall windows and spied the moon sinking toward the tree-line horizon. Usually, the moon spirit beamed one of its visages down to her, but that night, it gave way to her face. That night, she stared up to see her own likeness, and knew everything was going to be okay.

Magic PlantSim Stump
This stump will house the magic beans that have been collected from the PlantSims you've met. Place six unique magic beans into the stump nodules, add a little water, and see what happens!
Big Star
The comet is the prima donna of space. Look at it, trailing its beauty across the sky, taking up 75 percent of this entire painting. In fact, the artist was trying to capture a blank, night sky, and the comet totally photobombed that scene. What a diva!
T-Rex Nebula
It's silly for us as humans to project shapes we recognize onto the random, ever-changing patterns of the cosmos. That said, this nebula totally came together to resemble a T-Rex, right? (Not to be confused with T. Rex Nebula, star of children's sci-fi cartoons.)
End of Time
Oh, no! Someone just flushed the universe. Jiggle the handle! Jiggle the HANDLE!
Standard Space
Yup. Here's some space. Looking space-like. It's got the stars. And the dark, gassy looking stuff. And some more stars. Hang it on a wall, to give that wall a real spacey feel.  
Saturn Return
Hubba hubba! Check out this glamour shot portrait Saturn had done a few years back, when it went through a divorce and lost all that weight (who's the second largest planet NOW, Uranus?). The slight blue glow really brings out its rings. Rumor has it that it's dating again and has recently attracted a sixty-third moon.
Twinkle
Is it a rainbow? A cloud? Stars? You might want to sit down, because it's actually a rainbow-colored cloud filled with stars! If you do not enjoy the unbelievable union of magic things in this painting, well then, sorry there's a cold hunk of obsidian where your heart should be.
Rosie the Riveting
Gasses such as helium and hydrogen pool together with interstellar dust to create this riveting, rose-colored nebula. Why ARE gasses and dust so attractive way out there in space? Here on earth, this helium balloon covered in dirt—well, it's just not the same.
Animal's Planet
In the X57 region of the 1245P-Brock galaxy, there is a planet populated entirely by giant hamsters. Here, two monster-sized hamster balls glisten in the sun, awaiting the return of their fuzzy inhabitants, who are busy running on a Ferris wheel (not pictured).
Star Crossed Lovers
This fantasy painting captures the mythical union of a crystal rock formation with a sizzling comet. Theirs was a love affair that defied gravity, physics and, well, probably several other laws. No one thought it would last. In fact, it didn't. But at least it burned out, before it faded away.
Seeing Red
Mars is the red planet. The dirt is red. The air is red. Want to wear blue pants on Mars? Too bad! There are only RED pants on Mars. This painting shows the Mars sky, with its fiery red clouds. Beautiful to an Earthling. Martians, however, have coined the saying, &quot;Let's go out and paint the town green!&quot;
Out of This World Style
Like cars, rockets come in different models. The sleek sports rocket. The SUV soccer mom rocket. And this—a reproduction of an ad for the tricked out luxury sedan rocket. Its style is inversely proportional to its aerodynamic qualities. Get to the moon slower. And look good doing it!
I Dream of Plesiosaur
A cloud formation looks deceptively like a wandering plesiosaurus, set against a stunning early-evening vista. What might the cloud plesiosaur be searching for? The gentle stratus doesn't answer, but floats on, unaware of its inevitable demise.
Battle Stars
Since ancient times, we have scanned the night sky for signs of things to come. This star-spangled horizon contains countless constellations, each of which can be read for information about the future.  (The small U.F.O.s under the stars, for example, can be read as a sign of imminent attack.)
Surfacing
Just imagine this strange world as it would look viewed by an alien returning to its home planet. Oh the longing in that alien's five heart chambers, the tears in its 22 eyes. Back on the surface, it will no longer be “alien.” It will visit its neighborhood bar, where everyone knows its name: “XF2&amp;23%tY.”
Cloudy Vision
In space, cloudy days trump sunny ones. That's because the clouds are made of green glitter! The sun, on the other hand, is made of fire and radiation. Before visiting space, definitely check the space-weather forecast. Or just stay home and marvel at this painting.
Blemish Blossom
This artwork chronicles the awkward adolescent stage of plant cell development, where they are tormented by embarrassing acne. Absorbing enough rainwater can really help, and fortunately, a cell can just divide to create its own prom date.
Crystal Palace
At the crux of hard science and new age woo-woo lies the crystal. Here, we can see both the distinctive crystal geometry, revered by scientists for its electrical, optical and mechanical properties, and the glittery crystal sparkles, known for their harmonic love vibrations and aura cleansing magic.
Cell Block
Look at the precision fit of these bright cells. No wonder they’re called the “building blocks of life.” In fact, the only difference between toy blocks and living cells is that organisms are not assembled by children. (Except for the platypus; that was built by a third grader named Frank.)
Falling
Evoking all the colors of autumn, this mineral painting represents the diminished glow of youth, and the twilight years of life, when all hope is gone, and the path we have taken slides toward its eventual tear-filled end. Hang it in the breakfast nook or the baby's nursery!
Rhapsody in Blue
Don’t have a green thumb? No problem. Enjoy plants at the cellular level, where they’re actually blue—and in art form, where they require no water, sunlight or “Please don’t leave me!” pep talks.
Hooplankton
This compelling artwork captures the plankton hula hoop performance team mid-rehearsal, for a number that will sink into obscurity when, en route to a gig, the entire team is eaten by a turtle.
Party in Pink
Magnification reveals interesting facts about microorganisms, such as their preference for bubble gum pink décor and festive streamers hung in their living rooms, all year round. If life on earth were a giant party, microorganisms were the first to arrive, and as this painting reveals, they may be the last to leave!
Psychedelic Rock
If there’s one thing we've learned through microscopic explorations into the mineral world it’s this: Rocks sure are trippy! Here we have Dunite, magnified fifty zillion percent and captured in bright tempera. Hang it in a college dorm room! 
Leaf Meat
Isn't it strange how zooming in on a fossilized leaf actually makes it look similar to a piece of steak? Are plants and animals more alike than they seem? Do leaves also feel love and fear? What does this say about veganism? Should we eat anything at all? Art raises some serious questions.
Snow Fight
They say each snowflake is unique. Up close, these snow crystals, secure in their individual flakiness, appear to be gathering around one deformed snow pyramid, who they will shortly beat up for being TOO different. As this painting reveals, snow is not as gentle as it seems.
The Drifter
Never fall in love with a plankton. Flowing wherever the current takes them, they are total vagabonds. Here’s one such plankton, dancing with groupies after a night playing electric guitar with the Bacteria Band. Fortunately this moment was captured in art. We’ll never see him again.
Trace Remains
Ever just know something in your bones? That’s because the skeleton can act as an antennae, transmitting info to the brain. In this dinosaur fossil, we see the haunting conduits where bone instinct may have cried out, “Run! METEOR!” Dinosaurs had brains the size of peas. That’s why they all died. Enjoy your painting.
The Moon's Meteor
Every 10 years, the meteor &quot;Bob&quot; skim's this moon's surface. Friction from the atmosphere causes the meteor to ignite. Scientists predict that in time the meteor will dissolve fully, so enjoy it while it lasts!
Time-Lapse Moon
Scientists theorize this moon might be capable of hosting life. They've studied it at large, and have many time-lapse photos of it. 
Sixam from the Moon
Many have wondered what the planet of Sixam might look like. Wonder no more, for this is a picture of Sixam from the perspective of its moon. 
Mooooon
When Barnaby B. Cow discovered a moon surrounding Mrafmis 1, his colleagues were dismayed to learn that he had actually named it &quot;Mooooon.&quot;
The Flaming Moon of Flugne
Though the Flaming Moon of Flugne is titled thusly, it does not actually flame. Rather it has surrounding space debris that refracts an orange hue from the sun. Beautiful, yes? Fire, no. 
The Enchanted Moon of Lacigam
Scientists studying the Moon of Lacigam have discovered green energy that seems to emanate from its surface. Radioactive bursts of this mysterious energy are regularly pushed into space. The question remains: is the moon doing this itself or is someone down there? 
Anglerfish
A sneaky predator fish that lures prey into its mouth with a small, glowing tentacle-like growth on its head.

Peryllium
Peryllium, chemical symbol Ll, is a beautiful pink Orelloid. Many describe it as something that could only come from a unicorn’s magic, and that's scientists talking!

Sydrolin

Plathium
Plathium, chemical symbol Pl, is a member of the elite Royal Liquids, which have strong colors but no odor. Plathium looks a lot like lemonade but tastes more like horrible choking death.
Phozone
Phozone, chemical symbol Pz, is a member of the elite Royal Liquids, which have strong colors but no odor. The scientist that discovered Phozone really loved broth, noodles, and meat with just a touch of carrots, which she often ate while doing experiments.
Melacoo
Melacoo, chemical symbol Q, is a member of the elite Royal Liquids, which have strong colors but no odor. For a long time Melacoo was actually thought to be Sydrolin, but those scientists were just lazy.
Goobleck
Goobleck, chemical symbol Vg, is a member of the elite Royal Liquids, which have strong colors but no odor. Goobleck has been scientifically proven to have the best name out of all elements.
Alcineat
Alcineat, chemical symbol An, is a member of the elite Royal Liquids, which have strong colors but no odor. It was discovered in the 50's when someone found a puddle of it in her backyard.

Diamond

Turquoise

Shinolite
Shinolite is the shiniest stone of them all! Be careful looking at it as you might just get hypnotized by its gleaming silver beauty.

Cool as a Cucumber Marble
Hey Nova! It's me, Lewis. Guess what, I'm writing from Sixam!\nI decided to change my career path... Working at Rainy Days Inc really brought the worst out of me. I decided to pursue my dreams and attempt to become an astronaut and... I got an astrodynamics internship! One step closer to becoming Commander Shepperd, right?\nOh, and I have a present for you... I'll visit you soon! 
Yes - and Lewis, the competition is back on!
I know becoming an astronaut was also your childhood dream. If you want, I can get you in at a higher level.. How does that sound? Don't tell me you're afraid of a little challenge... or perhaps you think that I'll be promoted to Space Ranger before you?
I laughed so hard!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, guess who got a new job at a super cool startup and a super cool salary? That's right, ME! The childhood friend who you didn't want to help when he needed it the most. You might not know, but at high career levels you get to choose your own path and specialization. And I choose to never cross my path with yours ever again!
Sure, come over... tuna head.
I'll take pizza as an apology.
Yes {0.SimFirstName}, the rumors are true, I got fired from Rainy Days Entertainment. It seems I have &quot;an attitude problem&quot;. That's their way of saying I've basically been a jerk. Specially towards you. Can I come over to talk? I could really use a friend right now.
Wow, I almost had forgotten about that! Your dad would get so mad at us for playing with his lab equipment. Nerding out at his observatory was fun, though... Remember the sleepover at the rocket ship? Your cousin Tycho scared the crap out of me! He looked like one of those aliens from Density Effect… 
Ugh, not this again...
If you want a hug, Lewis, just ask.
What up tuna head? I heard you got a job at Rainy Days Entertainment, the same startup where I work. Ready to be overshadowed by me again? It’ll be just like in college! Don't worry, when they fire you I'll write you a recommendation letter... for a senior loser position! LOL&#xD;&#xA;
Hello {0.SimFirstName}. I just wanted to let you know we’re very impressed with your job performance. You’re doing a great job!\nRemember, if you don’t miss work, go to the office on time, keep your good mood and gain all the required skills, you’ll be set for your next promotion.
Let me think about it...
Wow, {0.SimFirstName}, I’m at a loss for words. I lost my job and... I just hope I haven't lost my childhood friend as well. I'm in no position to ask, but could I spend the night here while I figure out my next move?
I heard you’re new to the neighborhood and I know you're still getting adjusted, but Sofia and Leonardo are getting D's in their classes. I can tell they are smart, creative kids... so I can only conclude that the problem must be with their parents. Help your children realize their potential!\n\nI’ve got my eyes on them -- and on the two of you, Martinez. We do things a bit differently in my school district - I didn't win 12 Principal of the Year Awards by tolerating unruly children and unconcerned parents. You'll be hearing from me again!
Treasure your memories of when Sofia and Leonardo were cute, precocious bundles of energy and curiosity, because let me tell you, you've got a challenging road ahead of you. Teenagers need both freedom to learn and grow, and guidance and rules to ensure they stay on the right path. Encourage them towards becoming responsible adults if you can. Teenagers can get a part time job, excel in school, start learning new skills, and start forming deeper social and even romantic relationships, but they need your guidance -- desperately.  
Well, I admit it, I am impressed. At first, I didn’t think much of the two of you. Not your kids of course - you, the parents. But I’m pleased to say your kids have shown tremendous improvement. Remember though, life is not just about academics! Take the time to develop Sofia and Leonardo's artistic and athletic abilities too. Kids must have time to socialize, to have fun, to be kids! Find their interests, see what they aspire to be, and help nurture and guide them towards their potential. 
Well, that's a start. I can tell the two of you put in effort into parenting. But now it's time to go beyond just making sure Sofia and Leonardo have their basic needs met. It's time to work on a child's greatest gift -- a mind ready to learn and grow! \n\nWe need to turn Sofia and Leonardo's scholastic career around before it's too late! Make sure they are regularly doing their homework, building their mental skills, studying hard, and keeping focused! 
Sure, I'd love some tips!
No thanks, I've got this!
People are so excited about your housewarming party, {0.SimFirstName}! You &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; throwing one, right? I've hosted one or two myself; do you want some expert party planning tips?
A hangout downtown sounds great!
There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; someone I’d like to ask out…
I can’t believe you just moved here, {0.SimFirstName}—you've already made so many friends! I’d love to meet some of them, wanna do a group hangout downtown? Or is there someone you would like to spend some… &lt;i&gt;alone time&lt;/i&gt; with?
Likewise!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, it was really nice running into you at the gym! If you want a workout buddy to help keep you motivated, just give me a call. I could use some motivation myself!
Maybe we will!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, you've been on my mind since we met at the bar. Maybe it's just me, but I think we really &lt;i&gt;clicked&lt;/i&gt;, you know? I hope we'll meet again soon...
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, it was really nice running into you at the bar! If you want to grab some drinks later, just give me a call. I will never say no to a good Salty Llama!
Tell me more about Social Skills!
Great to know, thanks!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I hear you’ve met a lot of people already! A great way to turn these acquaintances into friends is improving your social Skills. Work on your Charisma, Comedy, and Mischief skills, and you’ll be the most popular Sim in town before you know it!
Wanna lift? Run? Punch? Awesome! My gym is the perfect place to get a wicked workout and meet other gym rats. Nothing like an exercise buddy to keep you on top of your game!
Thanks for the tip!
This town is so much larger than your neighborhood. You should go exploring! If you want to meet new people, the gym or the bar are great places to check out. If you want some company, let me know and I'll tag along!
Thank you! Looking forward to it!
Howdy, neighbor! Welcome to the neighborhood! My name is {1.SimFirstName} and I live just down the road. I'm sure we'll get a chance to meet in person very soon!
Sounds great!
Welcome to my humble bar; please, have a seat! Enjoy the company, some sweet tunes, and the best drinks in town.
We messed up. Maybe this is our second chance.
Even if we aren't perfect, you still love us.
Guess who's back! You thought I was going to just lie down and die? Not a chance. As long as you three are disgracing the family name, I'll be here to chew you out! 
I thought we'd have more time to set things right.
I guess it's time to open up our inheritance letters...
Alas, my time is drawing short. When you've lived as long as I have, you can feel it coming. Don't mourn me, I am going home to be with your grandfather, and I will be watching from above. My one regret in life is that I never pushed you three to your full potential. We have spoiled you, and this is more my fault than yours. So, I hope you understand, when I do this, I am truly trying to do what is best for the three of you, so that you might be pushed to achieve your own goals. I have done my best to leave you with what I think you will need to succeed in the long run.
You can count on us Grandma! You can rest now.
Maybe the Grim Reaper will give me a second chance.
My time here might be up, but I couldn't bear to pass on until I saw what the three of you would become. I'm proud of you. And if you go back to your old ways, I'll know and I'll haunt you! 
Alas, my time is drawing short. When you've lived as long as I have, you can feel it coming. Don't mourn me, I am going home to be with your grandfather, and I will be watching from above. My one regret in life is that I never pushed you three to your full potential. We have spoiled you, and this is more my fault than yours. But you have proven that you do have some strength of character and merit, and that you can, with proper motivation, make something of yourselves. I have done my best to reward each of you with what I think you deserve.
Your money, your choice, grandma. Do what you must.
NOOOO! That money was supposed to be mine!
It's not like I can take it with me... This hurts me more than it hurts you. You know, because I actually worked for this money. Hopefully now you realize I'm serious - I'll burn every last Simoleon before it goes to you three, unless I see some serious changes around here.
We will grandma! I told you we could change!
I knew we could get back in your good graces.
I have spent a lot of my life feeling upset with how you three turned out. At times I felt guilty, at times I felt saddened, and more often than not, I felt plain mad. But your efforts have shown me perhaps there is some hope. Keep it up!
OK, fine, you win, I will leave the house!
Why would I want a family? I have video games.
Now that you've got a job, I'm marginally less disappointed, but I still need to see a little more from you. Why would I give my money to a descendant that has no plans for their future? It's time you got out there and met your better half, though I highly doubt you can. But, feel free to prove me wrong.
I guess it is time to grow up...
We're rich, why waste our lives working?
Your grandfather and I have been working ever since we were teenagers. You three obviously think you're too good to get your precious hands dirty, but in my day, a respectable adult had a job. And a family, for that matter, but given how low my expectations are for the lot of you, I'll take gainful employment and some basic life skills as a minimum.
It's your money, donate away! 
Hey, you can't do that! We... we won't stand for this. 
I'll be able to rest more easily after I'm gone knowing this money is in more deserving hands... perhaps this will provide a little motivation to get your act together.
You're right. We can mend fences, or act like it.
It's not my fault my siblings are useless.
You three can hardly sit in a room together without squabbling like schoolkids. Siblings should stand together and work as a team, not bicker. This petty infighting stops now. If you can't put aside grudges and act like a family for at least ONE family dinner, so help me I will donate every last cent of my fortune to more deserving families...
Sorry grandma. Please don't be rash, we can change!
How dare you! We deserve that money.
I'm deeply disappointed with the way things have gone for all of you. We have a proud family legacy to uphold, and it's clear that you've let it slip through your fingers. You've squandered your opportunities and shown little regard for the values that have made us who we are. If you want to have any hope of inheriting a share of my fortune, you'll need to demonstrate that you're willing to work hard and make something of yourselves. Prove to me you've turned over a new leaf and the inheritance could be yours.
I think you can do better.
Yes, go for it!
Yes! Romance is in the air!
You should think about it yourself.
Honestly... I don't really care.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! {1.SimName} has asked me out on a date. Should I say yes?
Do what your heart tells you!
I don't think it's a good idea.
I don't think {1.SimPronounSubjective} would be a good fit for you.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I think I have a crush on {1.SimName}. Do you think it's worth a try?
I guess you could go for it...
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I think {1.SimName} is pretty cute, should I ask {1.SimPronounObjective} out?
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I've been thinking about getting to know {1.SimName} better as a friend. Do you think the two of us should hang out?
Quick question, {1.SimName} and I were planning to spend some casual friend time together. Should I do it?
Socializing is always fun, but that's your choice.
Of course, building friendships is a must!
To be honest, I'm not sure...
Usually I would, yes, but... not this time.
It pains me to say this... but no.
I'm sure they mean well, I vote Yes!
I think you should go for it!
I've heard good things about them, so maybe...
It's good to hear your voice {0.SimFirstName}! I wanted to ask you if I should get to know {1.SimName} a little better as a friend? They seem like good company.
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
In the end, {1.SimName} and I were not made for each other.
I think {1.SimName} and I were just not meant to be...
So, I ended up not going on a date with {1.SimName}.
Sorry to hear it.
Remember when we talked about {1.SimName}? We went on a very nice date!
Guess what? My date with {1.SimName} went very well!
You won't believe it, {1.SimName} is such a sweetheart! I'm in love!
Congrats!
After speaking with you I felt that it was best if {1.SimName} and I didn't hang out. I appreciate the help!
I just wanted to let you know I followed your advice and chose not to spend more time with {1.SimName}.
Hello there {0.SimFirstName}! I thought some more about what you said and concluded that {1.SimName} and I probably wouldn't get along.
I am delighted you recommended I spend some time with {1.SimName}, I was amused the entire time!
{0.SimFirstName}! Thank you for suggesting I hang out with {1.SimName}. We had a spectacular time.
{1.SimName} and I just had a blast together, thank you for your advice!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that {1.SimFirstName} and I are now dating! I'm head over heels for {1.SimPronounObjective}.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that {1.SimFirstName} and I got back together!!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that {1.SimFirstName} and I broke up...
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that {1.SimFirstName} and I are now friends!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that {1.SimFirstName} and I now despise each other. I just can't stand {1.SimPronounObjective}.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that {1.SimFirstName} and I are now best friends!

As filters are turned on, they are added to the list above the catalog. So even when the panel is closed, you'll know what's being filtered.
Build has a powerful filter system that lets you find the exact object you are looking for.\n\nClick the Open Filter Panel arrow at the top of any catalog to view the Filter options.
Click to learn more about the Filter Panel.
Windows
Windows can be moved vertically and horizontally along a wall to get the perfect placement.\n\nProTip: Holding the [alt] key allows for finer vertical placement of windows.
Windows can be sorted by height to find the proper window for your wall height. You can also use the Show All sort and find the window height information in the hover tip for each window.
Windows can be placed individually by clicking on the By Window option.  Or they can be placed automatically for an entire room by clicking on the By Room option.
Windows are found in the Build catalog by clicking on the Windows sort in the House Portrait.
Click to learn more about Windows.
Styled Rooms
This is a fast and easy way to instantly create a fully functioning venue!
Ladders have three exit points at the top, which means they can be placed up against a wall on any of their three sides (including the landing). So long as one of their three exit points are accessible, Sims will be able to use the ladder.
If you want to change the style of an existing staircase or ladder, choose a new stair or ladder from the catalog and move your mouse on top of the existing stairs or ladder and click.
To add a Railing to your stairs, click on the Stair Railings sort in the House Portrait. Choose a railing style from the catalog and click on the staircase you want to add them to.
To create a ladder between two floors, select a Ladder style and bring it towards the desired location. Hovering the Ladder over a floor tile at either the base or top of a room, will highlight the ladder green when in a valid placement. The Ladder will snap into place when it is close enough. You can click and drag to rotate the Ladder to suit your desired placement.\n\nNote: Ladders do not create floors. You will need to attach them to existing tiles in order to make them useful.
To create a stairway landing, first raise the foundation to the desired height. Select a Stair style from the Stairs catalog, and bring them close to your desired location. They will snap into place.\n\nIf they are not correctly oriented, click and drag to rotate the stairs.
To create a stairway to a new floor, select a Stair style and bring it towards a Room. The stairway will snap into place when it is close enough. You can click and drag to rotate the stairs to suit your desired placement.\n\nNote: Stairs do not create floors. You will need to attach them to exiting rooms in order to make them useful.
Stairs and Ladders are found in the Build catalog by clicking on the Stairs sort in the House Portrait.
Placed stairs can be adjusted much like rooms and walls. Select an existing staircase and use the side arrows to change the width.\n\nYou can also pick up or rotate a placed staircase by selecting the Move and Rotate options from the context menu.
Stairs, Ladders, and Railings
Click to learn more about Stairs, Ladders, and Railings.
Spandrels
You can remove Spandrels by clicking on the wall and choosing the Remove Spandrels option from the context menu.\n\nNote: Choose the  Build Wall or Build Fence option from the context menu to create either after the Spandrels have been removed.
Click on a style in the catalog and then click on the wall you want to apply the Spandrels.\n\nNote: Spandrels can only be placed on a wall and will move anything already placed on the wall to the Household Inventory.
Spandrels are found in the Build catalog by clicking on the Spandrels sort in the House Portrait.
Click to learn more about Spandrels.
Search
Rotate Object
Default camera style rotates object by clicking the right mouse button when an object is held by your cursor ([ctrl + RMB] will rotate in the opposite direction).\n\nSims 3 camera style rotates objects by using the left mouse button and dragging to rotate.\n\nProTip: You can always rotate an object or block held on your cursor by using the [&amp;lt;] or [&amp;gt;] keys.
Rooms and Walls
Click on the Wall Height options that become available once the Rooms and Walls catalog is open. These allow you to adjust the wall height for the current floor.\n\nNote: Some architectural elements, such as friezes, and some doors and windows, require a taller wall.
Roofs
Roofs are found in the Build catalog by clicking on the Roofs sort in the House Portrait.
Selecting a Roof style from the Roofs catalog will change the current floor selection to the first floor that needs a roof. Place the selected Roof on top of a Room, and then use the available adjustments to fine tune it afterwords.
Add extra style to your roofs with patterns and roof trim!  Both options are found in the Build catalog by clicking on Roof Patterns and Roof Sculptures sorts.
Use the arrows to resize width, length and height. Use the knobs to adjust the curve of the roof.
Click to learn more about Roofs.
Pools
ProTip: Pools will merge with each other to create a single Pool if they share the same exterior walls. This allows you to easily move and manipulate your Pools, and customize the look you are seeking.\n\nNote: Pools and Rooms will not merge since they are different block types. 
Click on the Pools sort in the Build catalog to place a Pool on your lot. There is also a Pools Objects sort for additional touches you can add to a Pool.\n\nNote: There are many Pool shapes to start building with. Mixing and re-shaping them can create something new and exciting! &#xD;&#xA;
Unlike Rooms, there are a few things you are unable to do with Pools. You cannot use manipulator to drag terrain Pools into Rooms or structures on another level--this would be super destructive. You are also unable to remove and build Pools walls via context menu. The water would just flood the space!\n\nProtip: You can drag a Pool into a Room if you first remove the room’s wall.
You can place a Pool in two ways: Directly in the terrain or within an existing room. As with Rooms, clicking on the placed Pool will open up a context menu. Use the Move option to pick up and move your Pool. Use the Rotate buttons to rotate the Pool left and right.\n\nProtip: Rotating can be destructive! Pick up your Pool with the Move option and then use the keyboard shortcut [&amp;lt;] and [&amp;gt;] to safely rotate.
Object Economy
All objects depreciate upon returning to Live Mode. Make sure you have things looking the way you want before you exit Build Mode.\n\nNote: Picking up an object will display its current value in the bottom right corner.
Friezes / Exterior Trims
Friezes and Exterior Trims are found in the Build catalog by clicking on their sort in the House Portrait.
Select the Exterior Trims sort and choose a style, then click on the Room you want to apply it to. Use the Sledgehammer Tool to remove an Exterior Trim.\n\nNote: Exterior Trims can not be placed on the first floor.
Friezes can only be applied to medium or tall walls. The catalog tooltip for a Frieze will indicate the required wall height.\n\nSelect the Frieze sort and choose a style, then click on the Room you want to apply it to. Use the Sledgehammer Tool to remove a Frieze.
Click to learn more about Friezes and Exterior Trims.
Foundations
Click on the Walls View button to toggle between Walls Down, Walls Cutaway, and Walls Up Views.\n\nNote: Walls Cutaway View will hide all walls between your current view and the back wall of your home. As well as cutaway to the active Sim if they happen to be behind the back wall.
To add foundation to your lot, use the Foundation Height Widget. This can be found in the center of a block when selecting it. \n\nAll blocks that are touching the selected block will raise and lower together. You can raise and lower separate non touching blocks independent from one another. Only Blocks of the same foundation height and on the same build level can be connected together. Blocks on different foundation heights and levels will never be able to connect.\n\nPro Tip: When trying to match the height of separate block cluster raise and lower the desired cluster until the blocks of the same height and level highlight white.
Build camera controls include an extra option not available in Live Mode, Top Down View. Toggle this option to switch between your normal build camera view and a top down bird's eye view of your lot.
To change the foundation style, choose a style from the catalog and click on the foundation you want to change. The style will apply to all of the foundation for a single Room.\n\nProTip: You can hold shift to only apply the foundation style to one side of a Room.
Click on the Go Down to Lower Floor or Go Up to Next Floor buttons to change the floor you are currently viewing. Walls will default to up on any floor below your current floor, and will be hidden for any floor above your current floor.\n\nProTip: You can use [PgUp] and [PgDwn] to toggle between floor levels.
Foundations are found in the Build catalog by clicking on the Foundations sort in the House Portrait.
Click to learn more about Foundations.
Fences &amp; Gates
If you start drawing on an existing wall, you'll get a wall railing. Wall railings function exactly as walls.\n\nProTip: You can also create wall railings by choosing Build Fence from a Wall context menu. And then apply a new fence style via the Replace Fence tool.
Select the Replace Fences tool from the Fences catalog. Then select a fence style. Click on an existing wall / fence to replace all wall segments along one side of a Room with the chosen fence.\n\nHold [shift] to replace the entire Room, or [alt] to just replace a single wall segment.
Fences and Gates can be found in the Build catalog by clicking on their sorts in the House Portrait.\n\nThere are two ways to build fences:  by placing them on an existing wall / fence or by drawing them with the Fence Tool.
Yard fences are similar to walls, but do not create floors when enclosed, and can't be widened though their length can be adjusted. And their only context menu option is remove them.\n\nNote: You can also delete them with the Sledgehammer Tool.
Select the Place Fences by Drawing or Place Fence Enclosure to begin drawing a fence. When drawing a fence, you can make two types: terrain fence or wall railing.\n\nIf you start drawing on the ground, you'll get a yard fence.
Click to learn more about Fences and Gates.
ProTip: Rooms will merge with other Rooms to create a single Room if they share the same exterior walls. This includes Rooms placed inside of other Rooms, such as inner courtyards. This allows you to easily move and manipulate your Rooms, and customize the look you are seeking.
You can Remove and Build Walls / Fences by clicking on the wall of a placed Room. Click on a wall to see the available options which vary depending upon the walls current settings. You can also Remove and Build Floors this way.\n\nNote: When a wall has been removed, click on the ghosted wall that appears to get the option to re-build it.
Empty Rooms
Doors
Click on a Room from the Empty Rooms and Walls sort within the Rooms and Walls catalog to place it on your lot.\n\nNote: There are many shaped Rooms to start building with, mixing and re-shaping them can create something new and exciting!
Objects cost Simoleons.  Open up the Objects by … catalogs and hover over an object to see its cost. Objects you can't afford will show up with a red background.\n\nAll unlocked objects are sorted in value order; the least expensive to the most expensive.
Fridge? Baby? Contemporary? Rocket? Whatever you might be looking for, type it in the Search field, click on the Search button (or hit Enter) and see what you find.\n\nMisspelled something? Maybe it will still find what you are looking for or click the X button to start a new search.
Doors are found in the Build catalog by clicking on the Doors sort in the House Portrait.
Click on the Styled Rooms sort from within the Rooms and Walls catalog to browse the pre-made Rooms. Selecting the Room sort along the top switches the catalog of pre-made Rooms to the chosen Room type, such as BathRooms, Dining Rooms, or Kitchens.
Click on the Build catalog and then click on the Rooms and Walls sort found in the House Portrait.\n\nTo build any structure, you will need to start here. Here you can find Empty and Styled Rooms, Wall and Room tools, and any Rooms that you have saved.
Click on a placed Room to open up a context menu. Use the Move option to pick up and move your Room. Use Rotate Room to rotate your Room to the left and right. Or click and drag one of the wall arrows to resize the Room.\n\nProTip: Rotating can be destructive! Pick up your Room with the Move option and then use the keyboard shortcuts [&amp;lt;] and [&amp;gt;] to safely rotate.
The more expensive an object, the more likely it is to provide greater benefits to your Sims. Hover over an object in the catalog to see what type of benefits an object may provide.
You can also choose one of the suggested pop-ups that appear as you are typing.
Doors can be sorted by height, or you can use the Show All sort and find the door height information in the hover tip for each door.\n\nNote: If the door you want doesn't fit on your walls, adjust the wall height at any time by clicking on any block and choose a wall height from the block gizmo.
Click on a Room in the Styled Rooms catalog to get a larger view of the Room.  From here you can buy individual objects or buy and place the whole Room to quickly add a new addition to your house.\n\nProTip: Double click on a Room in the catalog to allow for quick placement of the entire Room.
Click on the Empty Rooms and Walls catalog or the Styled Rooms catalog to browse the different Rooms available.\n\nNote: You can create multiple stories by clicking on the Floor Up and Floor Down arrows in the upper right, and then placing a Room on the upper floors.
Click to learn more about Doors.
If you're holding an item on your cursor, you can rotate it by tapping the . or , keys.
Build Catalog
To add a roof, click on Roofs and select one from the catalog. Once you click to place a roof, your floor view will change to make placement easier.\n\nProTip: A Room without a roof will be lit by the exterior lighting, and may not look the way you imagined it.
Make sure your Sims can get inside your creation and add a Door!\n\nProTip: In Live Mode, let the neighbors know where to go when they visit by clicking on any exterior door and choosing Set as Front Door.
Build Camera
Build Tools
Click Undo to undo the last Build action. Click Redo to redo the last Build action.\n\nUndo and Redo are saved per build session. Once you exit Build Mode, you will not be able to Undo or Redo any changes from a previous Build session.
The Design Tool can be used to quickly change the color choice of objects that have already been placed.\n\nSelect the Design Tool. Click on an object and choose a new color from the swatch pop up. You will not be charged Simoleons for changing colors.
Choose the Sledgehammer tool to delete and destroy.\n\nClick on an object to delete it. Or click and drag to remove a group of similar items (all items to be deleted will highlight yellow).\n\nNote: Bulldoze Lot is found in the Lot Info panel and is used to completely empty a lot. A warning, Bulldoze Lot can't be undone.
The Eyedropper tool is used to copy the properties of a placed object or pattern, as well as some architectural elements (such as fences and spandrels).\n\nClicking on what you want to copy will attach a copy onto the cursor, as well as open to the home location of the copied item in the catalog.
The Select tool is used to select objects and architecture found on your lot.\n\nWhile using any other tool, hitting [Esc] will always return to the Select tool.
Build Mode has several tools to help you build your perfect home.\n\nThe toolbar can be found in Build Mode along the top of the screen.
Can't find what you seek? Try Search. Just type what you are looking for and hit enter (or choose from the suggested items that pop up as you type).\n\nFilters can help to narrow down your search to a specific color or style.
To begin furnishing your home choose between the Objects by Room catalog, where you can imagine the décor of your home room by room. Or the Objects by Function catalog, when you would rather search for a specific functional need.
Use the Build catalog to add doors, windows, roofs, floors, adjust the foundation, or add architectural flourishes like spandrels, roof attachments, trims, and friezes.\n\nOr change the patterns of the roof, floor, and walls; add a fence, gate, stairs, columns, outdoor décor and a fountain, or just paint the terrain. Go nuts!
Start in the Rooms and Walls sort to begin building your home by plopping down fully furnished rooms from the Styled Rooms sub-sort.  Or craft your own rooms by clicking on the Empty Rooms and Walls sub-sort.
To get started click on the Build Mode button in the upper right.\n\nProTip: You can also use F2 to jump directly to the Objects by Room catalog, or F3 to get into the Build catalog.

Climbing the ladder in a writing firm only to be assigned boring projects just isn't for {0.SimFirstName}. Neither is working unpaid and hoping to publish something that catches on. All {F0.she}{M0.he} wants to do is put {F0.her}{M0.his} prose to the paper and be rewarded for {F0.her}{M0.his} efforts. Being able to work wherever {F0.she}{M0.he} wants is a great bonus, too.
Freelance Writer
Why sit in an office filled with coworkers talking about their kids? {0.SimFirstName} just wants to focus up and get some coding done in the comfort of wherever {F0.she}{M0.he} desires. No boss is going to tell {0.SimPronounObjective} what to work on. From spreadsheets to videogames, it's all {F0.her}{M0.his} choice!
Freelance Programmer
{0.SimFirstName} has made the decision to be a freelancer. As nice as that sounds, {M0.he}{F0.she} won't be able to find gigs or get paid until {M0.he}{F0.she} selects a trade, and an agency to represent {M0.him}{F0.her}.
Spec art is for starving artists; corporate art is for those who have sacrificed their creative soul. Surely there's a better way to earn a living wage without abdicating one's creative freedom? Such is the path of a freelancer, who possesses the temerity to pick and choose from those seeking {M0.his}{F0.her} artistic talents.

{0.SimFirstName} used to run a company, and now {0.SimFirstName} runs several. Fortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got smart folks in key positions, so {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got more free time to enjoy life... and the private jet.
Business Tycoon
This is it: the big chair. {0.SimFirstName} makes the moves and {M0.he}{F0.she} calls the shots. It feels good to be the {M0.king}{F0.queen}, doesn't it? Well, it probably would if {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't have the board of shareholders breathing down {M0.his}{F0.her} neck for results all day.
CEO
The corner office is {0.SimFirstName}'s. Everyone looks to {M0.him}{F0.her} for leadership. Too bad the CEO still calls the shots, but someday...
President
{0.SimFirstName} now has the key to the executive washroom! Responsibilities are great, but so are the rewards. It's going to take top-level people skills to make it to the top of this corporate ladder.
Vice-President
 Make Business Calls ({0.String})
 Fill Out Reports ({0.String})
{0.SimFirstName} has proved {M0.himself}{F0.herself} as a manager, but {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got {M0.his}{F0.her} sights set on the next level. Whether {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to be an executive or a financial whiz, it's time to put the effort in and make it happen.
Senior Manager
{0.SimFirstName}'s the {M0.man}{F0.woman} now! ... Or at least the manager of a region of the company. That means {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got to keep working on {M0.his}{F0.her} people skills if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants an even bigger slice of the pie.
Regional Manager
This is it... almost. Ok, so {0.SimFirstName}'s not a manager, yet. Surely {M0.he}{F0.she}'s next in line for the position. It's time to build those people skills for when {M0.he}{F0.she} has people to boss about, er... manage.
Assistant Manager
It's not quite management track, but it's the next best thing, isn't it? After all, the manager only has one assistant...
Assistant to the Manager
It's amazing how much assistance an office needs. The more energy {0.SimFirstName} has, the more {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll get done. The better {M0.his}{F0.her} social skills, the more recognition {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll receive.
Office Assistant
Far from the days when postal correspondence was the lifeblood of a thriving business, today's mailrooms have been made all but obsolete with the rise of email. Still, somebody's gotta distribute all the online shopping deliveries! {0.SimFirstName} will have to keep {M0.his}{F0.her} energy level up to get noticed... and elevated from the mailroom. {M0.He}{F0.She} can now Fill Out Reports on the computer and Gossip About Office Romances.
Safe Cracker
 Upgrade Objects ({0.String})
{0.SimFirstName} has taken {M0.his}{F0.her} talents into the mean streets, rocking getaway cars up on two wheels, hugging corners, running from cops. This stuff would make a pretty exciting video game!
Getaway Driver
From knocking out armed guards to intimidating rival gangs with a single arched eyebrow, {0.SimFirstName} is now the brawn behind the brains.  And {M0.he's}{F0.she's} closer to the action than ever. Don't mess with {M0.him}{F0.her}!
The Muscle
There's no trade route too treacherous, no cargo too controversial for {0.SimFirstName} to covertly ship across the universe and into {M0.his}{F0.her} customers' covetous hands. Capitalism is capitalism. And a 2000% markup is a 2000% markup.
Want the horn of an endangered zygax? How about a quilt handmade from 2,000 tiny Q505Bs? Maybe just a few Gibsonian chill-out pods for the big party next weekend? {0.SimFirstName} doesn't ask questions. {M0.He}{F0.She} just makes it happen. 
Any ranger who's quick with a laser can make more Simoleons in private security than serving the public good. {0.SimFirstName} protects galactic warlords, exterminates cabals of tribal terrorists, and helps corrupt governments maintain plausible deniability. 
When the universe is in danger, one {M0.man}{F0.woman} gets the call: {0.SimFirstName}, Space Ranger! With {M0.his}{F0.her} stout heart, keen wits, and a phozoplasmic Warp Pack strapped to {M0.his}{F0.her} back, Ranger {0.SimFirstName} defends the known galaxies from evil!
This here galaxy's {0.SimFirstName}'s jurisdiction now. Even-handed with the punishment and generous with the attitude, {M0.he}{F0.she} don't take no nonsense from alien punks, no matter now many tentacles or ocular cavities or rows of teeth they have. Also, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to talk like a sheriff!
{0.SimFirstName}'s drawn a pretty good beat. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} patrolling planet Illustria, which is scenic and upscale, with nice shops and restaurants. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't get the Bloodwar planet, which is also pretty scenic but has fewer restaurants. 
This is it: Astronaut. The best of the best. The heroic few. The job kids want to be when they grow up that they still want to be as adults. {0.SimFirstName} will now go boldly into that great beyond to explore the secrets of the universe and eat weird freeze-dried ice cream.
{0.SimFirstName} was hoping that if {M0.he}{F0.she} &quot;accidentally&quot; derailed a shuttle-board &quot;simulation&quot; {M0.he}{F0.she} might be able to launch the shuttle and get to space…but it turns out that actual spacecraft are pretty well-secured. That's good, because {0.SimFirstName} is still learning how to space brake and star park.
Low orbit is where the real action is-satellites, space stations, space walks, daredevils attempting to break the world record for high-altitude parachuting. If something goes wrong, it's also the closest place to breathable air, which is why {0.SimFirstName} likes it.  
Guiding virtual rockets into place, analyzing the movements of blinking dots on a computer screen, running simulations.... Looks like all those hours {0.SimFirstName} spent playing video games are paying off! 
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't think of {M0.himself}{F0.herself} as just a glorified mechanic. The shuttle costs billions of Simoleons, and any screw-ups would cost lives. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} more like a glorified engineer.  
 Play Chess ({0.String})
{0.SimFirstName} has always loved being under the sun! After all, {F0.she}{M0.he} is strong, energetic, and loves the smell of freshly cut grass. And grass is green, so simoleons must smell like grass! That, or lawnmower exhaust. Either way, mowing lawns is a great work out for {F0.her}{M0.him}!
{0.SimFirstName} is continuing their babysitting adventure by securing a job at The Munchkin Menagerie's Holding Hands Daycare. Working with a loving, experienced team of childcare professionals, {F0.she}{M0.he} will help provide a gentle, caring and stimulating environment that honors the genius in every child.
Daycare Admin
Little-known fact: Space is an absolutely filthy place. When the shuttles return, guess who gets to hose them down and scrub off the gunk? {0.SimFirstName} hopes the goo is just dirt and not some incurable form of Oozing Space Measles.  
{0.SimFirstName}'s always had dreams about exploring the cosmos, walking among the stars, and discovering places unknown. {M0.His}{F0.Her} journey begins here, in the file room, categorizing expense reports.&#xD;&#xA;

When {0.SimFirstName} had service, {M0.he}{F0.she} felt trapped—pressured to to be reachable by phone at all times. Having no reception might be annoying at first, but it sure is liberating! 
A Little Char Adds Character
Some food is meant to be charred-up nicely over a roaring flame or a smoky BBQ. Sure there might be a little smoke... there might be some gas fumes... but as long as the house isn't burning down, {0.SimFirstName} really doesn't care. 
Sore from Chores

Nature's Revenge
{0.SimFirstName} felt great when {M0.he}{F0.she} proudly plucked some produce and started munching away.

{0.SimFirstName} crunched {M0.his}{F0.her} way through a self-harvested, raw fruit or vegetable. The effort alone made the food taste all the more satisfying. The earth is basically {M0.his}{F0.her} grocery store now.

Crunchy Critter Snack
Living off-the-grid means taking full advantage of the land—including its most nutritious, crunchy, protein-packed creatures. {0.SimFirstName} should probably brush {M0.his}{F0.her} teeth before going out on a date, though. 
Amphibian Agility
Catching and eating the slipperiest of frogs has given {0.SimFirstName} enhanced reflexes and senses. With an extra leap in {M0.his}{F0.her} step, catching frogs, swimming, fishing, and other physical pursuits should be easier. 
Bad Reception
{0.SimFirstName} can't hear over all of that static. Oh wait! Can you hear {F0.her}{M0.him} now? No? How about now?

{0.SimFirstName} is already thinking of fun things to do with the new neighborhood arrivals. Drop in for a chat? Invite them over for a party? All of the above!

Toxic fumes can really do a number on you.
Tasks Cleared Out
It feels good to focus and get a lot done with few distractions.
A natural talent for the spy game will take you far.
Bugged Office
Maybe learning the sound bugs can make will be useful in the future.
Sharp Instincts
Sometimes, the best thing to do is take a nap. Especially after inhaling toxic fumes.
Racket Anguish
Pager Worries
Well, that was a waste of time.
One Less Friend
Who needs all those friends! Friendship is overrated.
The dullest day of all time.
Numbed Mind
Mentor Discovered
The Triangle is going to be a great mentor.
Fearless Hipsters
It's too bad that not everyone values branching out in a new direction....
Dissuaded Bullies
Tackling a difficult subject for the report will pay off long term. Always challenge oneself!
Difficult Report
Demo Scramble
Prioritizing work (and checking email) are just as important as getting a lot done.
Branching Out
It feels good to take on a new challenge and be successful.
Undercover Stories
Best place for an audio wire: on the target.
Maybe keeping the money would have been best after all.
Principal's Speech
No Lunch
Cheating never pays off. And in this case, the cost was an empty stomach.
Missing Fingernails
They'll grow back. In the meantime, maybe {0.SimFirstName} should wear gloves.
Kitten Savior
Humorous Boss
Henchmen Chat
There's always something new to learn about espionage.
Finders Keepers
Copied a Classmate
Thinking is hard. Copying is easier--and a lot less honest.
Assignment Extension
Whew! Extra time is definitely the remedy for this assignment.
Unneeded Questioning
Unsurprising in the context of a group project, one person's stuck doing all the work.
Slacking Classmates
Figured It Out
Pulling up one's sleeves to learn on the job is rewarding.
Secret Admirer
It seems the secret admirer is no longer a secret. What to do next?
Not Paid
Freelancers aren't volunteers. Writers should be paid for their work!
Missed Deadline
Missing a crucial deadline is a blow to one's morale. Sigh.
Not contributing in a group project shouldn't mean getting the same grade as those who did the work.
Lower Grade
My boss is such a kidder. He wouldn't have taken me out.
Heckler Shutdown
That heckler probably wishes he'd never spoken up.
Flubbed Attempt
Time to figure out how to deal with hecklers.
Hey now! A few extra Simoleons certainly improved THIS life moment.
Class Gossip
Being the topic of gossip is so miserable.
A great grade without having to do any work? Perfect!
A+ Project
Writing Praised
Smelly Tirade
The only thing that stinks more than being yelled at is being yelled at by someone who smells this bad.
There's nothing wrong with being perfectly average, right?
Perfect C Student
P.E. Nap
Exercise will burn energy, but naps will re-energize!
Sometimes, keeping your head down and working is the best route to take.
No News is Good News
You have to stay alert in this business, or the news will pass you by.
Caught Napping
That nap was really quite nice, at least until the Coach interrupted it.
Someone Else in Trouble
Sometimes, people get what's coming to them.
Sent into the Hall
Being bothered in class is bad enough, but getting in trouble for it is infuriating.
Riot Stories
It's always exhilarating to perform for friends.
The only thing worse than a long day at school is a long night of homework.
Mountain of Homework
It feels great to only have reading left over and be done with everything else!

This is horrible! I didn't wait this long for my new phone on opening day. I'm out of here.
I could have grown and cooked my own food by this point. This is unacceptable. I'm leaving!
Hmm... training after my shift. Are you helping me improve or are you trying to tell me I'm not good enough? Either way, I better study hard.
Thanks, I appreciate you investing in my future here! I'll go to a class next time I'm off work!
Thank you {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}. This will be a great opportunity to refine my skills. I'll go after my shift.
Great, just what I wanted, a chance to go to a class in my off time.
Off site training? Will there be an obstacle course? Don't tell me. I want it to be a surprise.
It is so good to hear the extra effort I've been putting in is noticed. Thank you!&#xA;
Wonderful. I try to be a model employee and it looks like my effort is paying off.&#xA;
The appreciation feels great. Keep the compliments rolling in. I can't get enough of them.&#xA;
Thanks for the feedback {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms} {0.SimLastName}! I won't let it go to my head.
Thank you {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}! I think I'm pretty awesome as well.
That was better than any poster I've ever read.
110%? After that speech I'm giving 120%!
A buzzword free inspirational speech. I'm inspired because you managed to pull that off.
Yes! This is our time! We can do it.&#xA;
I'm ready! I can do it! I believe in myself! Thanks for the pep talk boss.&#xA;
I'll work harder, I promise.&#xA;
Why are you so hard on me {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}? I'm doing my best.
I'll shape up and stop making mistakes. I just didn't sleep well last night.
I'm so ashamed. I didn't mean to mess up. Please don't put this on my permanent record.&#xA;
But... but... but... I've been trying to not mess up.
I'm motivated by my desire to stay employed.
How am I feeling about my job? Meh!
Things are going well. I feel I'm really starting to stretch my work skills.
I don't want to be too critical, but maybe if you put me in charge I could turn things around.&#xA;
I don't know why I'm still here. I couldn't be more unhappy.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to make the employee of the month.&#xA;
I don't know how much more of this I can take. You will miss me when I'm gone.
I'm feeling really fulfilled in my current role. It couldn't get much better.&#xA;
Things here are great! You're a fantastic boss and I couldn't be happier.
Things are okay. I can't say this is my dream career though.&#xA;
I like working here. My co-workers are all really fun to work with.
You are terrible, these co-workers are terrible, this whole place is terrible.&#xA;
Things could be better if you spent a little more time paying attention to the business.&#xA;
It's great working with you {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}. I feel you are a fair boss.
Who needs weekends when your job is this good?&#xA;
I'm doing okay boss.  Nothing new to report.
I love this job! I think I found my true calling.
I'm underpaid and overqualified.&#xA;
The customers don't seem to appreciate my work right now. At least they are not complaining either.&#xA;
You're a terrible boss. I wish that you weren't, but you are. Every day.
Things are not going well. I feel like I'm the only one working around here.&#xA;
Work is what work is... It's just a means to an end for me.
Listen {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}, maybe you should spend more time on the business than on checking with me.
I'm almost tempted to stay here for some overtime. Almost...
The work here is rewarding. We get along well, and I feel valued. I'm satisfied with that.

Hi there! My name is Nanny {0.SimLastName}, nice to meet you!\n\nI am sensibly sufficient in every way. I can play, cook, and mentor!\n\nAnd yes, I’m not opposed to changing diapers and cleaning up messes, if needed. Let’s have a fun day together!
Hello! How are you doing today? It is delightful to see you again!
You are learning so fast {1.SimFirstName}! Excellent!
Sometimes bearing your soul through a series of revealing cards that are delivered an entire class of teenagers isn't a good idea. This was probably one of those times. While {0.SimFirstName} went in a more sensitive direction, everyone else went comedic, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} is the laughing stock of the class. Maybe in a week everyone will stop talking in goo-goo voices to {M0.him}{F0.her}.
Who takes {1.String} seriously, anyways? Those kids with sappy cards were, well… saps! Not {0.SimFirstName}. Everyone who opened {M0.his}{F0.her} cards had a good laugh. Now {0.SimFirstName} is considered the funniest kid in school. Who knew {0.SimFirstName} could be such a comedian?
Apparently {0.SimFirstName} isn’t funny. The teacher didn’t think so. {M0.His}{F0.Her} classmates didn’t think so. Even {0.SimFirstName}’s friends didn’t think so. The word being thrown around is ‘insensitive.” Apparently, {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to start taking people’s feelings a little bit more seriously and maybe not mock holidays that others hold dear.
{0.SimFirstName} decided to buy flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and make it seem like {M0.he}{F0.she} was popular! The rouse was a success until lunch when the school bully pulled {0.SimFirstName} aside and announced that they knew…\n\nThankfully, the bully thought it was funny, and {0.SimFirstName} got off scot-free (and with {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch money)!
{0.SimFirstName} decided to buy flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and make it seem like {M0.he}{F0.she} was popular! Unfortunately, the plan backfired and {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates were jealous. Instead of looking cool, {0.SimFirstName} spent the rest of the day ignored…
{0.SimFirstName} decided to surprise the entire class with flowers! While sitting in math, each flower was hand-delivered, taking enough time to get them out of a test!
{0.SimFirstName} decided to surprise the entire class with flowers! Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot to sign the cards and when the flowers were delivered another kid took credit. What a crummy {1.String}!
{0.SimFirstName} decided to keep the flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}! While at recess, another kid spotted them and offered to trade for some real flowers. Considering it an upgrade, {0.SimFirstName} accepted. {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} started the day with nothing, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} had a bouquet of real flowers. What an enterprising young sim!
{0.SimFirstName} mulled over who to give {M0.his}{F0.her} tissue-paper flowers to, but the answer was easy! {M0.Himself}{F0.Herself}! {0.SimFirstName} strutted off, flowers in hand-that was, until the wind plucked them free and stole them! The bright flowers drifted in the wind’s current until they were little specks on the horizon, never to be seen again…
After school, {0.SimFirstName} spotted a sad girl sitting on a bench. {M0.He}{F0.She} walked over and extended the bouquet of tissue paper flowers. Upon seeing the gift, her face lit up, and she gave {0.SimFirstName} the biggest hug ever! The teacher was right—It was so rewarding to make someone else’s {1.String} special.
{0.SimFirstName} passed by {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher, a sad little girl, and the school bully. Nothing felt “good enough” until {M0.he}{F0.she} spotted an old man, alone in the park. {M0.He}{F0.She} reached into {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack only to find that the bouquet of tissue paper flowers had been utterly demolished by {M0.his}{F0.her} homework while walking… There was probably a lesson to be learned here.
{0.SimFirstName}’s crush didn’t even know {M0.he}{F0.she} existed. This was an opportunity! In the heat of the moment, {0.SimFirstName} walked past the cubby and delivered the card directly into the hands of the most popular kid in school. After having it declared “the most awesome card ever,” {0.SimFirstName} was invited to hang out with the popular kids at recess and lunch whenever {M0.he}{F0.she} wanted! Doesn’t that make {0.SimFirstName} a popular kid too?
{0.SimFirstName}’s crush didn’t even know {M0.he}{F0.she} existed. This was an opportunity to change that! {0.SimFirstName} bypassed the cubby in favor of a hand-delivery. Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she}  wasn’t able to find {M0.his}{F0.her} crush on the playground. By the time {0.SimFirstName} gave up and returned to the cubby, {F0.her}{M0.his} crush’s bookbag was gone and the entire opportunity had been lost.
{0.SimFirstName} secretly dropped {M0.his}{F0.her} card in the cubby. When the other kids came in from recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} watched from across the room as {M0.his}{F0.her} card was opened. Glitter spilled out from the envelope, but it was surpassed in brightness by {M0.his}{F0.her} crush’s smile. Though {M0.his}{F0.her} involvement remained a secret, {0.SimFirstName} went the rest of {F0.her}{M0.his} day with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
{0.SimFirstName} secretly dropped {M0.his}{F0.her} card in the cubby. When {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates came in from recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} waited as {M0.his}{F0.her} crush put their coat away. Unfortunately, the {1.String} card had slipped between the cracks and was never found.

Ravenwood
Things always get a little spooky in Ravenwood. The Whispering Glen with its nightly Moon Revelry festivities is perhaps the most &quot;normal&quot; part of the area, where locals have settled down for a slice of quiet, country life. Crow's Crossing village, however, is clearly quite haunted—swings swaying by themselves, that Merchant fellow down by the Crypt, scary little Edith guarding the Well of Longing and Regret…but despite the hauntings, the living have certainly made it their home as well with a variety of festivals and places to explore. Mourningvale is where things get extra ethereal! It's well known as a home for Ghosts and those seeking them. Sometimes Grim even stops by!
Chilling Collections
Stop by the Collector Signs in any of the three neighborhoods, explore a Crypt, discover the secrets of the Tarot Tome Shrines, or check out the eerie ruins of Whispering Glen.
Memorial Sites
Crypts, Cemeteries, the Afterlife Anonymous meeting, and little consoling Specters! Ravenwood is the perfect place to lift the spirits.
Ghosts &amp; Grim
Want some Ghosts? Mourningvale is a literal ghost town, and Crow's Crossing village is clearly haunted! Soak in the spooky during Ravenwood's many festivals, become a temporary Ghost by taking a dip in the Baleful Bog, and possibly even run into Grim himself.

High School Years
Copperdale
Once renowned for its booming mining industry, the town of Copperdale, quaint and historic, lay nestled on the banks of Lake LaSuli. Founder Jasper Prescott had foraged this land for its treasured crystals, hoping Copperdale would one day blossom into a prosperous community for families and travelers alike. And though the mine carts reached an eternal halt, the townspeople continued to flourish. With academics and adventures abound, Copperdale is now home to many families seeking a small-town life with big-city dreams for themselves and their teens. Together they've unearthed a gem far more precious than before - beloved high school memories.

San Sequoia
San Sequoia began as a small fishing town, then became a hub of the fishing and canning industry due to the influence of local fisherman-turned-entrepreneur, Bayani Robles.

Today, San Sequoia is home to cozy streets, a beautiful park with gardens, and quiet suburban neighborhoods. It's the perfect place to raise a family!
Family Friendly

Ugh, they gave me a theme song. Flight of the Fumble Bee.
Things really started to click today. After a practice like that I've got high hopes for the game this weekend.
Mud and grass stains will ruin most outfits, but I really pull this look off.
The team was completely in sync today. If we keep this up we will go all the way to State.
Three touchdowns today! I don't think anyone's questioning who the best receiver is on this team!
Someone needs to tell my teammates that this is PRACTICE! I'm not meant to come away with this many bumps.
There are not enough pads in the world for the kind of tackles I just took in football practice.
Now I have to be responsible for schoolwork AND contribute to an activity? There goes my couch time.
Activities beware! I'm gonna crush this or fumble my way through it. Either way I'm happy to be on the team!
Putting myself out there to try something new! The perks of an extra curricular are endless.
Instant access to a new social group! Why doesn't everyone join an afterschool activity?
Guess this makes me a joiner! I'm excited to make new friends and work some afterschool magic!
I just want everyone to know, I like the fruitcake. Please bring more.
Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down.
I, {0.SimFirstName}, fully believe the gnomes are alive and destined to be our leaders.
I, {0.SimName}, still sometimes wet the bed.
I can only pull this off so many times. Eventually all these prank vibes I'm putting out are going to come back on me.
I can't become a prank master if I just repeat old material! I need new ideas...fast!
Prom is THE night! I've been waiting for this my entire teen life. 
Just call me Jimmy Mocksburg, cause I'm gonna keep this prank train rolling for as long as I can!
I'm just in a silly goofy mood and a silly goofy mood means pranks.
Honestly, the most mortifying thing that can happen during a prank is getting caught.
Talk about a wave of guilt. If pranks are meant to be fun, why do they upset people?
About to go down in history as the ultimate Prank Master.
I really should have stopped to smell the roses more.
Smell ya later, friends!
The unequivocal sorrow! Taken from the land of the living only to live on as a cautionary tale...
This is definitely a win/lose situation...on one hand I was completely right. On the other hand, I am now dead.
Can we say iconic?! From the colors, to the fabric, to the patterns. Altogether it's a ten out of ten!
Hot Take: thrift shops stress me out. There are too many options and somehow I never find the good stuff.
The top I hid last week was gone! I knew I should have bought it when I had the chance.
Thrift shops are my happy place.
Look at all these statement pieces! This'll be such a look!
I've never been thrift shopping before. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to even look for.
The best gems in my closet are always second hand.
Fresh new fit and so thrilled with the look!
All this extra work is exhausting! The worst part is, I did this to myself... no one to blame but me.
Why is it that I can crush any goal I set for myself but I can't figure out friends? Being social can be so uncomfy.
I think I might have bit off more than I can chew...a little stress is motivating but too much and I'm drowning.
Whoever said you can't be good at everything clearly never met me.
I'm on my way to being the best of the best, nothing can stop me!
The rush of productivity! It's euphoric to take on the world!
Parties come and go so quickly. It's heartbreaking whenever they end, and the nightly silence takes over.
Some party memories don't seem as great in the light of day. What happens at parties should definitely stay there.
We're teens, partying is practically a rite of passage! If you can't let go and have some fun, what can you do?
Partying is my vibe. There's chaos! Freedom! Even just the energy in the room is exhilarating!
Parties are the best way to just let loose and enjoy life! They're my happy place.
In my hands, a pillow must be classified as a dangerous object. PILLOWWW FIGHTERRRRR!
No one prepares you for the stress of keeping up with trends while also being a trend setter.
Talk about a fashion don't! Not even Avant Garde could save a look so tragic.
Some would say its just a blue sweater, but I think we all know the difference between cerulean and cyan.
From catalogue to couture, it's always thrilling to see a fresh design hit the runway, or in my case, the hallway.
I could gush about clothes for hours but my true love lies with accessories.
Who wouldn't want to hang out and watch what I do?! My stream is the place to be.
This started as a small side gig, and I am proud of what it's blossomed into! My stream community is the best.
Content creation is my true passion! I'm hoping to use my platform to make friends and spread positivity.
Like and subscribe! Check me out over on stream whenever you get the chance!
I have all the go to recommendations and know all the hottest trends.
You ready for a review that'll knock your socks off?! I got all the info you need!
Pillow fights are supposed to be stress relief, so how come I feel so on edge?
I'm over the moon. Sooooo many people look to me to know what's hot right now.
What's a Batuu Bounty Hunter's favorite drink? Boba Tea
Nothing makes me bubblier than bubble tea!
They have cheese foam. I REPEAT. THEY HAVE CHEESE FOAM!
Do boba pearls remind anyone else of tears slowly falling down into the sadness of your soul?
Why does cafeteria food have to be so soggy?
Lunch is the best time of day, you can see all your friends and enjoy some tasty dishes!
Is it wrong to like the cafeteria food? It's the highlight of my day.
I wish I brought my own lunch. This is just gross.
You say socially awkward, I say independently advanced!
The social FOMO is such a downer, but I do not wish to be perceived. The spotlight is haunting.
A pillow smack to my soul! It will take days to crawl out of this hole of sadness.
Even a little bit of social interaction is a step in the right direction.
I fumble around to find the right words and by the time I do it's too late. Social skills are not my strong suit.
What happened in the photo booth, stays in the photo booth. xoxo
Oh no. I'm pretty sure there was a tongue in my ear for that shot.
Totally cheeky moment to keep in a very hidden scrapbook! What a rush! 
That's not a filter. Our faces really are that flushed and red. I wonder what we could've gotten up to in there.
Dark. Intimate. Limited locations for hands to wander. The photo booth may be my new happy place.
Strike a pose! How fierce! These photos are model quality.
Where is this dismal abyss? Is there a good angle of my face? Do I always look like a sea squash or is it the lighting?
I'd rather eat lemons than be trapped in a photo with some of the kids I go to school with. Major ick.
I could not get the timing right in that photo booth and ruined every photo! How lame is that?!
That pillow fight was euphoric. I feel like I'm glowing.
How many can I take?! I want a million!
Smiles for days! Every angle is a happy one!
Say cheese! Nothing cuter than a smiley photo!
A night away from family for besties and blankets? Sign me up!
You won't find a pea under this mattress but that doesn't make it any more comfortable. I miss my own bed.
Jammies, snacks, gossip...Sleepovers are the vital bonding moments of adolescence. Plus they're fun!
Pom poms or not, I'm the football team's biggest cheerleader! Score! Score! Score!
I could not tell you a single detail about what happened at that football game. I'm pretty sure I blocked it out.
Check this off my list. I've officially gone to a football game AND I enjoyed it!? How crazy.
They really do keep all the good stuff behind R ratings! Gotta say though, the popcorn was the real MVP.
I'm not entirely sure I should've seen that movie. It's rated like that for a reason. I can't unsee that.
Someone kept kicking my insanely sticky seat the entire time. This is why I stream movies at home.
My seat was sticky and someone kept kicking my seat. Not exactly a thrill of a lifetime.
Who knew that taking a pillow to the face could be so thrilling!
That movie had so many forbidden words and now my brain knows them all... What if one slips out!?
Did I love the movie or did I love sneaking in? Maybe both! My whole body is tingly with excitement.
My ears won't stop ringing and I'm drenched in sweat that may or may not be mine. Ugh. Were concerts always like this?
Waking up with no voice tomorrow will be hard to hide but so worth it. Ten out of ten, would scream every song again.
I don't think I'll have a voice tomorrow from all the screaming! It was worth sneaking out for the lifelong memories.
I'm still reeling from the concert rush! That exhilarating euphoria will live in my bones for days!
If given the option to sleep or go stand around outside, I think I'd choose sleep.
It's nice to just be out and about! 
Sneaking out means seeing friends. Seeing friends means bonding time. Bonding makes you happy. It's not rocket science.
I liked being a warm blanket burrito more than hanging out late at night.
Sneaking out was a huge risk and just to see some friends? I'm all for fun, but being caught is not on my to do list!
I went a little too hard. It was supposed to be just a friendly pillow fight.

Tarot Cards
&lt;i&gt;Amidst the tombs where silence binds, a wand’s card in the crypts one finds. Yet, should darkness deter your quest, the wand shop offers a safer rest.&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Within the shadows where Lenore's Order lies, Find the members, heed their cries. Complete their quests, though paths are hard, and win yourself a sacred card. The Grim Enthusiast Member is the one to seek.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;By the eerie waters of Baleful Bog, where mists arise and shadows clog, use intuition, let senses guide, The Empress within shall hide.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Within the shadows where Lenore's Order lies, Find the members, heed their cries. Complete their quests, though paths are hard, and win yourself a sacred card. The Death Obsessed Member is the one to seek.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Within the shadows where Lenore's Order lies, Find the members, heed their cries. Complete their quests, though paths are hard, and win yourself a sacred card. The Death Obsessed Member is the one to seek.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When twenty-five cards you have amassed, Death himself shall appear at last. With a solemn gaze and eternal breath, he shall bestow the final card: Death.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Befriend a crow, black as the night, and earn its trust with gentle might. In return, a card of the World’s insight shall be bestowed, a gift from flight.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To uncover a card of arcane might, seek the spectral merchant Waylon, cloaked in night. His dealings are secret, his presence a blight, but treasures await those with courage to sight.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In the heart of Crow's Crossing, where specters roam and memories intertwine, converse with the restless souls for a glimpse divine. Through their tales of catharsis, the hidden card you shall find.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To find the card of Suspension's plight, search through Crow's Crossing graves with careful sight. Or, with ghostly powers, levitate a victim slight, and the hidden card shall come to light.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Within the shadows where Lenore's Order lies, Find the members, heed their cries. Complete their quests, though paths are hard, and win yourself a sacred card. The Widowed Father Member is the one to seek.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Among the gravestones in Crow's Crossing there, where the departed rest in silent despair, a hidden card awaits with intuition's glare. Seek with care, for the past's whispers linger there.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In the depths of the Well of Longing and Regret, where darkness consumes and chaos unfolds, what lies hidden, their secrets untold. Beware of Edith, avoid her mark, lest your fate be sealed in the eternal dark.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Within the hollow of an ancient tree, two cards lie hidden for those who see. But take heed of Alice, the sorrowful ghost, who mourns her lost child, her vigil unending at this haunted post.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When the moon is full and night sky is bright, and the Moon Revelry festival is alight, seek the card of the moon while digging in this mystic rite. Only under Luna’s gaze, will its secrets ignite.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where golden dreams turn to dust and decay, in the crypts where the lifeless lay, a coin's visage in card form holds sway. Venture forth, and let the shadows guide your way.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Beneath the cold stone of forgotten souls, where shadows whisper secrets untold, lies the card of swords, amidst the crypts of old. Seek where the dead repose, and the truth shall unfold.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In the depths where the living dare not tread, among the silent watchers of the dead, a chalice card rests with secrets to be read. In these hallowed crypts, let your steps be led.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Within the shadows where Lenore's Order lies, find the members, heed their cries. Complete their quests, though paths are hard, and win yourself a sacred card. The Widowed Father Member is the one to seek.&lt;/i&gt;

Tassels can be found in many places around Tomarang. Be sure to check around the beaches, the Night Market, and delve into the Sulea Tiger Sanctuary. There's rumors of a cave nearby too, for the brave and adventurous sort. 
Tassels
Every tassel has been found and the collection is complete.\n\nKhun Mae would be proud! Her story is also one that ended in victory, with the people of Tomarang cheering and showering their saviors in gifts and glory. For her bravery, Khun Mae was made Leader of the village. But as she rejoiced, she was also left bewildered by her sacrifice's outcome: a soul split in two. A tiger sat quietly in the crowd, watching her, waiting for her command. This tiger was special, as it now carried the other half of her soul. She knew they would be bonded for life, so she snipped a tassel from her shirt and tied it around its neck. The village embraced them both and Tomarang lived on in peace, thriving under The Great Mother and her other half. Legend has it, these are the very same tassels she once wore!\n\nClick on a tassel in your Sim's &lt;b&gt;Inventory&lt;/b&gt; to combine all 10 colors into a special reward.

The distinction between a Just and Unjust Eviction is important. Just Evictions carry no repercussions, while Unjust ones will harm the Property Owner's relationship with the Tenant, lower the Unit Rating, and potentially lead to an Eviction settlement, costing additional Simoleons for the Property Owner.

{0.String} Dynasty
{1.SimFirstName} says, &quot;I'm not too familiar with them, but the Envoy who was here kept muttering &quot;Darong...art&quot; repeatedly while searching through the books.&quot;\n\n{1.SimFirstName} continues, &quot;Maybe I should try to look at them, too.&quot;
Noble Sims can't do this. 
{1.SimFirstName}, the Envoy, sighs with relief and smiles as they say, &quot;Thank you so much, {0.SimFirstName}, for not turning me in. I saw an opportunity, and got carried away. Do everyone a favor and look after those treasures. I might pay them a surprise visit one day.&quot;\n\nWith that, {1.SimFirstName} leaves for now...
&lt;font size=&quot;14&quot;&gt;{0.String}&lt;/font&gt;
Emotions get channeled into the melody, and the fireplace flame dances with the rhythm. Something can be seen flickering through the flames.
{0.SimFirstName} remembers the code {0.SimPronounSubjective} found hidden on Cordelia's Statue in the museum and wonders if it's related to the Royal Envoy's plan. {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.enters}{P0.enter} the code and voila! The Master Plan file opens and it is shocking. You know, As someone who is trying to commit such a large crime, the Royal Envoy has a terrible understanding of cybersecurity.\n\nThe file reveals all of their plans in detail. It turns out, the Envoy was trying to steal the treasures for themself this whole time, sell them off, and make a massive profit! Wow, it also includes the specs for a massive house with so many hot tubs...\n\nNo wonder the Royal Envoy has been acting so shady. They have been tricking people this whole time! They must be found immediately. This crime cannot go unanswered!\n\n{0.SimFirstName} remembers someone mentioning that the Royal Envoy was running towards the Blue Velvet Nightclub in Willow Creek...maybe they're still there.
{1.SimFirstName} laughed saying, &quot;If you want to find them, look next to the lake. They mentioned taking a one-way trip on the ferry to their new life of luxury and wealth.&quot;
Swordsmanship
Clandestine
What happens on this lot, stays on this lot! Sims can get up to all sorts of scandalous behavior without fear of secrets spreading.
(From Completing the Master of Grudges Aspiration)
What a magnificent work of art, but making art is only the beginning!\n\nKnowing the artist's intent and message is where true art comes to life.\n\nExpressing feelings about it is certainly a good idea. It's what the Darongs would have wanted! You should give it a try!
The Envoy's eyes widen in surprise when {0.SimFirstName} appears.\n\n&quot;Wh- What are you doing here? Listen, please understand this isn’t what it looks like- Oh...you read my master plan. Well, can you blame me?! I'm stretched so thin between these families. What about my happiness?! I just wanted a nice hot tub when I’m done with this job.\n\nListen, if you report me this could cause great upset in the kingdoms. I bet they won’t ever trust you and I won’t be able to show my face again! But if you forgive me and let me go, I promise I’ll just stop and walk away. The Simoleons I would get from these treasures wouldn’t make up for me losing my job and reputation anyway.&quot;\n
The Envoy rushed out and said they would be here at the library.\n\nSurprise them with a question!
Remove Sim from Dynasty?
Removing a member from Dynasty affects their relationships, moods and more. Are you sure you want to remove the member? Removing will be finalized when selecting to confirm in Dynasty Settings.
When enabled, Dynasty Prestige will slowly decrease over time to maintain the challenge of keeping a highly prestigious Dynasty. Disabling this will mean only Sim's actions can increase or decrease Prestige.
Enable Dynasty Prestige Decay
If disabled, the dynasty prestige will not decay automatically.

Did you know? In Ondarion, you have a higher chance of finding a rare Noble Frog!
Sims in Ondarion say that mastering Swordsmanship may let you draw the Sword in the Stone.
Proud Sims might avoid duelling you if you're too skilled; boost Charisma to improve your chances.
Swordsmanship is a Noble art, so losing a duel against a Commoner is just so scandalous!
The Ondarion Swordsmanship tournaments are prestigious events with extraordinary prizes.
Is someone extorting you? Confront them with a fight, persuade them to stop, or maybe just hope for their untimely demise?
The info broker is mysterious; can you uncover their true identity yourself?
A confident, playful or focused Sim can more easily extort an embarrassed, stressed, or uncomfortable one.
