Add Extra Juice
This time, the dish is cooked to perfection. The customer is not only happy, but leaves {0.SimFirstName} an extra tip.
Remaking the dish takes too long, and the customer leaves. Maybe next time, {0.SimFirstName} should use the microwave.
{0.SimFirstName} bucks the trend and keeps making drinks with familiar, local juices, and customers keep drinking them. No harm, no foul, no unnecessary expense.

{0.SimFirstName} climbs a nearby tree and coaxes the kitten out of the window. {M0.He}{F0.She} had to drop a box of loot to do it, but {0.SimFirstName}'s no kitten killer! 
A team member arrives, only to trip an alarm on the way in. {0.SimFirstName} escapes but {M0.his}{F0.her} cohort gets pinched on the way out! That won't go over well with the bosses...
Everyone keeps asking if {0.SimFirstName}'s plans are locally sourced, and if all agreements are fair trade. Exhausting. {0.SimFirstName} can't deal with this crowd!
It's good to know second in command has {0.SimFirstName}'s back 100 percent. Well more like 25 percent. Hey, maybe next year, that cut can go up to 30. But let's not get hasty. 
{0.SimFirstName} turns to run, which is when the kitten hurls itself out of the window and lands, claws out, on {0.SimFirstName}'s head. Swearing, {M0.he}{F0.she} rushes off to tend to her wounds while the kitten prances away merrily.
It was a trap. The software company uses the attempts to gather digital &quot;fingerprints&quot; from the world's best hackers and lock them out of the system! What gives them the right??
Everyone loves hamsters with LASER EYES! Pew! Pew! Kaboom! {0.SimFirstName} wonders if this will actually increase traffic to the company's site.
When the documents go out, there is a lot of tension and a few isolated incidents of violence, but thankfully no riot. {0.SimFirstName} hopes it was worth it.
Eh, that kitten knew what it was getting into when it signed up to be an indoor cat. {0.SimFirstName} scampers off with two armfuls of loot to fence.
Ah, the ol' &quot;Crazy Ivan!&quot; {0.SimFirstName} spins the car around, and, catching the cops by surprise, speeds between the two patrol cars with inches to spare on either side. The patrol cars collide attempting to follow {M0.him}{F0.her}. Clean getaway!
How could {0.SimFirstName} not have noticed the camera crew on the other side of the coffee stand? They were shooting a movie. The pickpocketing was caught on film.
Let it slide? What's the point of muscle that no one's scared of?! The bosses are mad that {0.SimFirstName} didn't take the opportunity to prove {M0.his}{F0.her} worth.
Nothing's ever really gone from the internet. {0.SimFirstName} isn't able to remove every instance of the old posts, and only deleting some is as good as doing nothing.
The car sails beautifully over the gap in the bridge. It's just like in that TV show except that when {0.SimFirstName} lands {M0.he}{F0.she} breaks both axles and loses the muffler. Whoops.
{0.SimFirstName} pathetically tries to pass off a garbage bag and trash can lid as the height of nouveau fashion. But hey! {M0.He}{F0.She} draws so much attention as a faux fashion correspondent that no one notices the deal go down.
{0.SimFirstName} has frost-bite from sitting in the freezer! {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to get out when the cook opens the door, but it will be a while before {M0.his}{F0.her} safe-cracking fingers are at full dexterity again.
High-profile targets mean high-profile consequences. Maybe {0.SimFirstName} can find a target that DOESN'T have the full attention of every bystander and camera in the area.
A rare talent like the Chonky Dog only comes around once in several generations. His handler's are quick to pay the ransom in full!
Another team member arrives in time to open the walk-in and help carry out loads of tuna. Things worked out, but maybe this was not a solo job after all.
{0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} crew hang out in front of the juice bar looking mean. The bar's clientele is scared to go in! The juice bar will be forced to close in no time.
 Hey, the rest of the internet didn't earn this private glimpse into the most anticpated book of a generation! The sweet, sweet secrets are all {0.SimFirstName}'s.
{0.SimFirstName} knows that the smartest hackers don't go after jobs that bring that much attention. Better to stick to the shadows (if the internet had shadows).
{0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} crew hang out in front of the juice bar looking mean. The hipsters LOVE the gangster kitsch and the juice bar thrives.
Now second in command wants a higher cut of every robbery. How is {0.SimFirstName} supposed to afford {M0.his}{F0.her} weekly pedicure, teeth whitening and poolside massage? 
While servicing the latest dirty shuttle, {0.SimFirstName} notices something strange…there’s a greenish moss growing on the underside of the wings. If the shuttle really went to planet Myotkee, there’d be a lot of meteorite debris and no moss. Should {0.SimFirstName} ask {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, or not ask questions? 
Strange Transmission
While on a solo mission to space quadrant 89 (how are there so many quadrants?), {0.SimFirstName} hears a strange transmission come across the radio. It doesn’t even sound like Simlish, just a bunch of silly, gibberish language instead. What could it be? {0.SimFirstName} can either follow the trajectory of the transmission, or ignore it.
Crazy Diagnostics
Moments before a big launch, the avionics on the shuttle are acting up-blinking and beeping like crazy. It might be nothing, but it also might be a terrifying fatal error. Should {0.SimFirstName} scrub the entire launch, or let it proceed and hope for the best?
Moon Cheese Hijacking
{0.SimFirstName} is taking a suspect into custody when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets a call that there’s a Moon Cheese hijacking in progress. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} pretty close, but in order to respond to the call {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} have to leave {M0.his}{F0.her} suspect unattended for a while. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
Selecting a Mission
{0.SimFirstName}’s offered the chance to choose {M0.his}{F0.her} team’s next mission. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either send {M0.his}{F0.her} astronauts on a high-stakes mission to the outer reaches of space, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can send them on an easy information-gathering run closer to home. Which should {M0.he}{F0.she} choose?
As {0.SimFirstName} walks up to the pilot-side porthole, the pilot ejects from his craft in an escape pod! He’s long gone, but {0.SimFirstName} throws the tarp off the cargo to reveal 13 pygmy Grinxes! {0.SimFirstName} calls Alienlife Control and gets a bonus for being so observant.
Gouge the customers
Charge a fair price
Inside the capsule, {0.SimFirstName} finds a tiny space creature. Wow! A totally undocumented form of life! This is going to look great on {0.SimFirstName}’s desk. 
When {0.SimFirstName} opens the capsule a tiny puff of shimmery dust floats out,  which {M0.he}{F0.she} immediately inhales. That’s probably not good. A few minutes later {0.SimFirstName} feels extremely ill. Thanks a lot, Space Dust!
Leave It Alone

Install It Anyway
Wait For Permission
It’s {M0.his}{F0.her} first mission, so it’s smart not to take stupid chances. {0.SimFirstName} gives the object a wide berth.
The guard doesn’t budge. Doesn’t blink, doesn’t smile, and doesn’t move. {0.SimFirstName}’s left staring at the windows, trying to see movement inside. That’s not going to be enough to take any action against the factory.
A few words of flattery, a few bats of the eyelashes, and {0.SimFirstName}’s in. Not only is the plant breaking safety violations and staffed by underpaid migrant laborers, but the only communication device is a fax machine. {0.SimFirstName} shuts down the factory and raids the kitchen for a mid-day snack.
The shuttle hovers for a few seconds before crashing back down to earth. The impact shatters the shuttle frame and fries the electronic equipment. Plus, all the astronauts are claiming they have whiplash now.
{0.SimFirstName} convinces the entire control room that there’s nothing to worry about, and indeed the launch goes off without a hitch. The astronauts are launched safely into orbit, and {0.SimFirstName} tries hard not to think about the eventual landing.

As {M0.he}{F0.she} draws closer to the Unidentified Floating Object, {0.SimFirstName} realizes that it’s a harmless but beautiful moon rock! {M0.He}{F0.She} sends out the robot arm to retrieve it, and {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} keep it forever as a nice memento of {M0.his}{F0.her} first trip.
As {M0.he}{F0.she} draws closer to the Unidentified Floating Object, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that it's a space squid--and it's making some very threatening gestures. {0.SimFirstName} fires the retro rockets before the monster space-inks all over {M0.his}{F0.her} ship.
It’s best to let the men in the black suits deal with things like this. {0.SimFirstName} is praised for not asking too many questions.
Inspect the Cargo
Look Him Up
It eats up some more of {M0.his}{F0.her} precious fuel, but {0.SimFirstName}’s able to make the repair in a jiffy. The instructor praises {M0.his}{F0.her} quick thinking and risk-taking.
Making the fix eats up even more fuel, and eventually {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} running on fumes. If this were a real shuttle emergency, the craft would never have made it back home.

The guard talks a good line, but he’s way outta his league. {0.SimFirstName}‘s badge is SO shiny and impressive! The guard opens the door, {0.SimFirstName} promptly shuts down the factory, and there’s leftover birthday cake in the break room. {0.SimFirstName} has a snack.
{0.SimFirstName} is not paying the guard’s paycheck, the factory owner is. The guard is unmoved, and also refuses to move. {0.SimFirstName} will not be getting into this factory!

The pilot must have smelled trouble, because he peels off in a hurry. {0.SimFirstName} jumps in {M0.his}{F0.her} patrol pod and catches him after a short chase through the Zoricon-9 galaxy. The holo-vid of the chase gets millions of hits on the interstellar viralnet!
{0.SimFirstName} takes so long trying to identify the suspect that he takes off. {0.SimFirstName} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} patrol pod to give chase, but the standard issue ranger pods can only make point five past lightspeed. {M0.He}{F0.She} loses the suspect somewhere around the Zoricon-9 galaxy.
High-Stakes Mission
Easy Close Mission
After dozens of attempts, {M0.he}{F0.she} just can’t crack the formula. Now {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} behind deadline and has to ask for help on what should have been an easy task.
