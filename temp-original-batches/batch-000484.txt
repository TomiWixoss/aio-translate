Churrasco is a Brazilian barbecue method where juicy pieces, slices, steaks, and chops of beef, veal, lamb, pork, and chicken are placed on big skewers and grilled over wood fire. This practice started in the early 1800s when the Gaúchos (people that settled in the Rio Grande do Sul area) would get together and start a fire, adding large portions of meat on skewers and slowly grilling the meat.\n\nAs a bonus, this item is Lactose Free!

Challah is a type of bread often baked for Jewish celebrations such as Shabbat. Typically, challah is prepared in a way that's pareve in that it doesn't combine dairy products with egg. The bread loaves are braided and, on Rosh Hashanah, are often presented in a round &quot;turban&quot; form. On Shabbat, two loaves of challah are covered with a cloth that can be rather elaborately embroidered or decorated and Kiddush blessings are recited before the bread is sliced and eaten.\n\nDepending upon the occasion, challah may be served sprinkled with salt or with honey and in some cultures raisins, dates, or other ingredients may even be added! No matter how you slice it, this rich and eggy bread is a delicious treat that helps unite people all around the world.\n\nVegetarian-Safe, Lactose Free

The origin of the dessert isn't certain, but the most common theory is that it was created by a confectioner from Rio de Janeiro, Heloisa Nabuco de Oliveira, to promote the presidential candidacy of Brigadier Eduardo Gomes, hence the name &quot;Brigadeiro.&quot;\n\nThe dessert is made of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles covering the outside layer making it the perfect bite type of dessert. Given it is very easy to make - and well, absolutely delicious! - it made its way into being a staple in parties and any kind of festivity really. So don't be surprised to spot these at any Brazilian celebration!\n\nAnd don't forget, this is a Vegetarian Safe dish!
