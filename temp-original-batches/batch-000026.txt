Camera Controls
Sims 4 has two camera styles. The default style allows you to click on open terrain and drag to move the camera.\n\nBoth camera styles behave differently, so experiment with the left, right, and middle mouse buttons to find one that suits your play style.\n\nYou can modify the camera style by pressing the Sims 3 / Sims 4 camera buttons at the top right of the screen, press Ctrl+Shift+Tab, or access the Game Camera settings in Game Options.
The default camera style does not have the option to Pitch (or Tilt) the camera. As you zoom the camera in and out, it moves along a path that allows for an easier experience for viewing your Sims.\n\nYou can modify this setting in the Game Options / Controls &amp; Camera tab.
Taking Screenshots and Video in the Sims 4 has never been easier. Simply click the shutter button found next to the time controls.
Press the camera button (or press C) to take a screenshot of the game. Press the video button (or press V) to start/stop video capture. Click the picture button to view all the screenshots and memories that have been captured.
Calendar
The Calendar can also be used to book future events. These events have one hour reminders before they start.
Access the Calendar by selecting the &quot;Show Calendar&quot; button at the bottom of the Live Mode screen.
The Calendar displays upcoming events such as birthdays, school days, and work schedules.
You can filter items in the Calendar to see specific types of events. Select the heart icon next to an event to tag it for the &quot;Favorites&quot; filter. 
Toddler Skills
Imagination Skill is meant to measure a Toddler’s creativity. Being in the Playful emotion will help to boost Imagination Skill gains, along with things like Playing with Toys or the Dollhouse, or Reading.\n\nUpon age up into a Child, Imagination Skill will result in a boost to the Creativity skill.
Toddlers have 5 skills of their very own. Each skill can be built upon by interacting with other Sims or objects. Advancing in each of the Toddler Skills (except for Potty) provides a boost to future Child skills.\n\nAs your Toddler increases their skills, you might find it becomes less time consuming as you care for their Needs.
There are three levels of Potty Skill for the Toddler to advance through. Building Potty Skill can occur by using the Potty, or Asking for Potty Help from a Caregiver.\n\nAs the Toddler becomes more proficient with their Potty use, they may find they have less accidents, and adults will have less difficulty changing their diaper.
Thinking Skill gauges a Toddler's mental progression. Toddlers can build Thinking Skill by doing things like the Show Flash Cards or Ask Why interactions, or by choosing the Study interactions on Nesting Blocks.\n\nWhen a Toddler ages into a Child, Thinking Skill will boost the Toddlers Mental Skill.
Toddlers can build upon 5 levels of Communication Skill by doing things like Talk or Babble with other Sims or Learn with Flash Cards. As the Toddler advances their Communication Skill, new interactions will become available for the Toddler.\n\nUpon age up, a high Communication Skill will allow the Toddler to get a boost in their Social Skill.
Toddlers begin by stumbling about, but with time they learn to climb stairs, and eventually run. Toddlers can gain Movement Skill by going places, bobbing or dancing to music or even Stacking with Nesting Blocks.\n\nUpon age up into Child, Movement Skill will boost the Toddlers’ Motor Skill.
Toddler Care
Toddlers need others to provide for their Needs. A Toddler Bed, High Chair, and Potty will also greatly help to ensure your Toddler is getting the best care. Make sure to pay attention to your Toddlers’ Needs or you might find the Social Worker will whisk away your little tyke.
For optimal toddler happiness, you should head into Build Mode and browse the Toddler sort. Toddler Beds, High Chairs, Pottys, Tablets… everything a growing toddler needs!\n\nAll of these can be found by clicking on Objects by Room / Kids’ Room sort, and then clicking on the stack of blocks to open up the Toddlers sort.
Time for bed… or maybe it’s just time for the adults to relax. You can let your little ones sleep on the floor, couch, or a chair, but your Toddler will rest better if you click on the Toddler or a Toddler Bed and choose Put to Sleep, or Read to Sleep.
Toddlers have a special relationship with some Sims; their Parents and Caregivers. Sims that fall into one of those two groups will concern themselves with and care for the Needs of the toddler.\n\nYou can also choose to become (or remove) yourself as a Caregiver by selecting the Adopt as Care Dependent interaction in the Toddler Care menu.
Toddlers can use their diaper to fulfill their Bladder need, but maybe you don’t want a little stinker running around. Get a Potty, and Potty Train your Toddler!\n\nClick on the Potty and choose Potty Train. As your Toddler gets better at using the Potty, they will be able to go on their own with confidence!

World Map
The individual Sim Info Panel not only has information about the Sim's personality, but it's also a fast and easy way for you to track them down if they're away from home, even between different worlds. Click the direct play button within the Sim Info Panel to quickly dive in game and play as that Sim. It's so convenient!
If a selected residential lot is occupied, you can learn a little bit about who lives there by clicking on the household info buttons or the individual Sim buttons in the lower left corner of the screen. 
If you choose to visit a lot, the Household Picker will appear to help you choose households or Sims from either your played or unplayed households to bring with. 
In Manage Worlds mode on the Map, you'll find a number of different options that pop up in the lower right corner when you click on any lot. Depending on whether it's residential or a venue, occupied or unoccupied, you'll get options appropriate for that lot. You'll always have the option to either visit or build on any lot. Find additional actions under the more button. 
Get directly to the Map of your active world by clicking the Map button in the upper-right hud in Live mode or use the F5 hotkey.
Wants
There are multiple ways to reset your Sim's Wants. Having your Sim Wake Up for the Day or return from work can give your Sim new Wants. If you really want to see your Sim succeed at completing their Want, you can pin the Wants so they won't get reset.\n\nYou can also go to the Rewards store and spend some of those Satisfaction points you earned to buy the &quot;Want Refresher&quot; potion to reset your Sim's Wants whenever you want!
What are the benefits of completing your Sim's Wants?\n\nMoodlet Buffs are given to the Sim when completing their Wants. Allowing the Sim to do what they want will have them feeling fulfilled and happier with life!\n\nSatisfaction points are granted on completing the Wants of your Sims. This can then be used in the reward store for some awesome rewards.\n\nSome Sims might not appreciate having their Wants ignored for a long time.
Wants are back! Wants are your Sim's way of sharing their desires with you. It will be up to you to decide whether or not your Sim will follow their Wants.\n\nSims can have 3 different Wants at once, though one of them will be more about what the Sim wants at the moment.
Visitors
You can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;invite&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; other Sims over for a visit. Open the Social app in the Cell Phone, or select a Sim in the Relationship Panel, and use the Invite Over to Current Lot option.\n\nYou’ll also find the option to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plan a Social Event&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (for example, a birthday or dinner party) in this app, which is another way to invite Sims.
Other Sims will stop by from time to time for a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;visit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. When you first move in, the neighbors will come over for the Welcome Wagon event—they might even bring a treat!\n\nSims will also move about in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Neighborhood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, outside of your Home lot. Having your Sim introduce themselves to these Sims is a great way to meet new people. 
Venues
To visit a venue, click on your Sim's phone and select Travel, then select the destination!\n\nYou can also hit the [m] key to view the Map, and travel from there. Venues will have a bubble over them to indicate their venue type.
You can also create your own Venues by clicking the Build button in a lot’s option tray.\n\nChange the Venue type within the Lot Info Panel.
Sims can visit the local bar or lounge for a refreshing drink, or perhaps the park for a little outdoor excitement with friends.
Vacations
When going on Vacation, a Sim can choose to Vacation in any Residential World that contains a Vacation Rental venue lot. With certain expansions, they may also visit a Destination World instead. These are worlds that Sims may only vacation in and may not use as a residence.\n\nAfter selecting a world, choose a Vacation Rental lot for the selected Sim(s) to live in throughout the duration of the vacation.
Sims wanting to take a vacation and travel to a new locale may do so by clicking on the “Take a Vacation” interaction in the Travel section of their Phone, or from a computer. Up to eight Sims can go on Vacation together at a time. 
Turn your Sim into a walking art display by adorning their body with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;tattoos&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! To get started, select your Sim’s body, select the Body button, and then the Tattoos button.\n\nYour Sim can have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;multiple&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tattoos, but only one on each part of their body. Some tattoos come in different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;colors&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or swatches, which you can see once selected.\n\nIn the swatches menu you can also find a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;slider&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to change the tattoo's Opacity. Some tattoos even have sliders to edit Hue, Saturation, and Brightness!
Skin Tone &amp; Eye Color
To change your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;skin tone&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their body, press the Body button, and then press the Skin Tone button. This button is also available in the Face menu.\n\nThere’s a wide range of Skin Tones divided into four categories; Warm, Neutral, Cool, and Miscellaneous. \n\nOnce you’ve selected a skin tone, you can further adjust it by pulling the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;slider&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can also save a customized skin tone by pressing the Save button.
To change your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eye color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their face, then their eyes. You will find many eye color options at the top of the Eye customization menu.
Hairstyle &amp; Color
You can edit the style and color of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on your Sim’s head by selecting their head, and then their hair (or the Hair button in the menu).
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Hair color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is selected at the top of the Hairstyle menu. There are a lot of fun shades to choose from! Some even have dashing strands of gray in them.\n\nKeep in mind that your Sim will have the same hair color for every &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Outfit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; category.
You can have different hairstyles for different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Outfits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Change your Outfit category with the Outfit buttons at the top of the Hairstyle Menu and then select a hairstyle in the menu below to set a style for that Outfit category.
There are a lot of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hairstyles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to choose from! From curly tresses and intricate braids to sharp bangs and mohawks, you’re sure to find a style that suits your Sim.\n\nTo make it easier to find what you’re looking for, you can sort by &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Short, Medium, Long, and Updo) or use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;filters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For example, you can filter by Texture to look for Afro-Textured, Straight, or Wavy styles!
Face Sculpting
The most basic Preset is the full &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Face Preset&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Select your Sim's face and choose the Face option in the menu to access the Faces catalog. These are unique facial archetypes that you can select to make your Sims look appropriate for different ethnicities. \n\nYou cannot achieve the look of one shape by manipulating another, so choose carefully!
When &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sculpting&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a Sim’s face, you have two main tools at your disposal: &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Presets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;clicking and dragging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nBy combining various Presets for the different parts of your Sim’s face, you can quickly create a unique look. Then you can customize it in detail by clicking and dragging to make their face match your imagination!
Then there are Presets for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;each part&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Sim’s face: Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Head Shape, Cheek, Jaw, Chin, and Ears. Simply select that part of your Sim’s face, and the selection of Presets will appear.\n\nSome Presets have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unique characteristics&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that can’t be created by clicking and dragging, such as chin dimples.
You can adjust the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;scale&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;position&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and (in certain cases) even &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rotation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of each part of your Sim’s face! Click and drag on your Sim’s face to experiment.\n\nDepending on where you placed the cursor, you will manipulate a face part in different ways. For example, selecting the inner corner of the eyes allows you to rotate it, while selecting the outer corner resizes the eyes instead.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim to access even more Drag options! For example, nose length can only be edited from the side view.
But wait, there’s more! While editing your Sim’s face, you can select the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Detail Edit Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to get access to even more detailed click and drag options. For example, you can adjust the width and thickness of your Sim’s upper and lower lip, independently of one another!
Eyebrows, Facial &amp; Body Hair
To customize the style and color of your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;facial hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select their head, and then the Facial Hair button in the menu. You can sort by category (Beards, Goatees, Mustaches) to make your perfect style easier to find.\n\nOnly Sims with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;male&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gender setting (found in the Identity Panel) can have facial hair.
Edit your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eyebrow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; style and color by selecting their head, and then their eyebrows. This will open a menu with different eyebrow styles.
Your Sim has more hair than what’s on the top of their head! You can also customize &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;eyebrows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;facial hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;body hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nYou can select a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unique color&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for all these hair categories, or check the Match Hair checkbox to match the color of the hair on your Sim’s head.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Body hair&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; comes in four categories; Arm, Torso, Back, and Leg Hair. You can find them by selecting your Sim’s body, and then the Body button. You can select one option in each category, and can select a unique color for each if you wish.
Body Sculpting
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Muscle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; adjustments apply to the entire Sim. Muscle controls define shape and size, while Fat controls a layer of 'soft' bulk.\n\n\nClick on your Sim's body to access the Muscle and Fat &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sliders&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Click and drag the sliders to adjust them.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;body shape&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be adjusted with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Muscle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sliders, and then further customized by &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;clicking and dragging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nUse these tools to create uniquely shaped Sims!
You can also customize &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;individual body parts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Click a body part and drag to sculpt it.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Rotate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim to access even more Drag options! For example, belly size can only be modified from a side view.
If you don't want to start from scratch, click on your Sim's body and choose the Body option from the context menu to access the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bodies&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Preset catalog. You can use these as is, or as a starting point for your sculpting.
Face &amp; Body
You can customize your Sim’s physical appearance in a number of ways! \n\nUse powerful &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Presets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to quickly create a unique Sim, or customize every little &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;detail&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to bring your imagination to life.

Adding Sims
To create a Sim that &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;looks like&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; one of the existing Sims in the Household, you can select Play with Genetics. This tool makes it easy to create a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Parent&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sibling&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of other Sims in the Household.\n\n\nYou can learn more about Genetics in the Lesson &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relatives &amp; Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Households can have up to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;8 Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nA Household must have at least one Sim who is a Teen or older to move into a home.
You can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;add&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; more Sims to your Household by clicking on the Add a Sim button. \n\nChoose &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Add New Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to add a random Sim to your Household. Then you can customize this Sim to your heart’s content!
You can also add a Sim from the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gallery&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by using the Add Sim from the Gallery button.\n\nOnce you’ve found a Household you want to add, use the Place Household button. You can either Merge this Household with your current Household, or Replace your entire current Household.
If you want some help to shape your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;personality and backstory&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you can Add Sim via a Story. By answering some multiple choice questions, a custom Sim will be made for you. \n\nThe Sim’s Traits and Aspiration will be fixed, and they might get some starting Skills, Career Levels, and extra Starting Funds. You can customize their appearance, name, and gender.
Undo &amp; Redo
Use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Undo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to undo your last action. You can then use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Redo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button to redo that action if you changed your mind. \n\nYou can undo and redo in several steps, but once you leave Build Mode, your edit history is wiped and you can’t Undo or Redo your last actions.
Time of Day
Use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Time of Day&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool to cycle between different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;light conditions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nFor example, the Afternoon setting gives great light, while the Night setting allows you to check the effects of any Lighting Objects on the lot.
Sledgehammer &amp; Bulldoze
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sledgehammer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is used to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;delete&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a lot of Objects or features quickly! Select the Sledgehammer and either click things individually, or click and drag to delete many things at once.\n\nWhen clicking and dragging, you will delete all Objects or features in your selected area, depending on where you first clicked. Everything that will be deleted is marked with yellow.\n\nYou can also delete everything at once with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bulldoze&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool. Be careful, you can’t undo after you’ve Bulldozed!
Select
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Select&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tool is used to select Objects and various architectural features such as Rooms and Roofs found on your Lot. \n\nOnce selected, they can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;moved&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;deleted&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or (in the case of Rooms and Roofs) &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;resized&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;reshaped&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nWhile using another tool, you can hit the [Esc] key on your keyboard to quickly return to the Select Tool.
Move Lot &amp; House
Do you like your house but not its location on the Lot? Don’t worry, the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Move Lot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Move House&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tools are here to help!\n\nMove House allows you to move or rotate a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;building&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the lot. Select a building with the tool to access the Rotate and Move buttons. You can also press the [Del] key on your keyboard to sell that entire building.
