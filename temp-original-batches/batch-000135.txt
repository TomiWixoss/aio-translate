Hanging out feels more exciting when you have to sneak out to do it!
That party was a taste of what life will be like someday and a truly awesome memory to have when I'm old and boring.
Everyone was so much older and intimidating. I felt like a little kid the whole time. It was awful.
I don't think I'm ready for a college party. Way too many things to worry about and stress over!
That was my scene! Those were my people! I can't wait for that to be my life all the time!
First time sneaking out! Not sure if it's paranoia or adrenaline but I feel SUPER HUMAN.
Can't believe I got caught. I blame the creaky window pane.
A little trouble never hurt nobody and I'd say tonight was more than successful.
I'm heading out tonight. Can't remember if my parents lurk but if you do, you didn't see this. 
It's way easier to jump out of lockers than to wait around in damp old caves to jump out and scare passerbys.
Follower Update: Today your follower count changed by {0.Number}.
Bat they didn't see that one coming! No one expects a bat in their locker.
I'm the terror that flaps in the night! I am the dog that eats your homework!\nHiding in that locker was the perfect prank.
I did my best to hide my tears and muffle my cries in my locker. Everyone still noticed.
It's comforting crying into the door of my locker. The cries echo back to me and it feels like I'm less alone.
Wants to be added to your contact list.
Not even a Cowplant wants to be around you, {0.SimFirstName}.
Please, just go back into your house and remove the door. No one wants to see you in public.
Wouldn't it be just soooo terrible if you happen to find some sabotaged objects in your future.
You look like a shaved Llama!
Your follower count and you are the same. A big 0.
Did it get hot in there, or was it just me? A fire alarm can really wake you up out of a steamy daydream.
A benefit of being fire prepared is that I got to miss out on class time and that pop quiz.
We are going to do terribly in a real fire! That evacuation was so slow. Only half the alarms worked.
Ugh, could that drill have taken any longer?! I have things to do! Act like there's a fire and MOVE IT!
Bring it on, Fire! We are ready for you now!\nAfter these fire drills we will definitely keep our cool.
My feet hurt and I'm still indecisive as ever. Just thinking about the future during Career Day is exhausting.
Got my future locked in! Trust your gut and pursue your dreams!
I'm not sure career day helped... How can anyone decide what to be?
After that Career Day I am beyond ready for my future! Come at me world!!
There's a bright future in front of me full of possibilities and I can't wait to dive in.
Violence on school grounds?!? Total anarchy! I can't be dodging bad grades AND fists.
{0.SimFirstName} U up?
I've got an idea. You, me, and a boba tea with two straws.
I'm thinking you would be a great pillow fight partner, {0.SimFirstName}. How about it?
Wanna go to the ice cream stand? I'd like a scoop of you.
Let me take you to Plumbite Pier. I've got a seat on the Cuddle Carts reserved just for you.
You know when cats swipe at each other but never make contact? That's what that fight was. So boring!
The soul of a coward rests in these bones, and it was proven by my utter lack of interference during that fight.
Welcome to the punch bowl, home of the punches! Utterly exhilarating to see a fight between foes!
I can smell the sweet air of freedom! And possibly the stench of afterschool activity sweat.
If you saw me in detention, no you didn't.
Do they make detention seats extra uncomfy or is it just the shame of being there that hurts?
Spent all of lunch with food in my teeth! Was no one going to tell me?!
Seeing someone with lunch in their teeth. How embarrassing!!!
Gross! Can this cafeteria food look any worse?
