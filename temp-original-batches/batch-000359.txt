{0.SimFirstName} has mastered the art of the paper airplane, and can’t wait to try {M0.his}{F0.her} original, supersonic design. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} already finished {M0.his}{F0.her} worksheet and the substitute isn’t looking. Maybe now’s a good time?
Principal's Visit
Today, the principal is visiting {0.SimFirstName}’s class! Everyone is to be on their best behavior and not interrupt the lesson. Unfortunately, the kid sitting behind {M0.him}{F0.her} has decided to pelt {M0.him}{F0.her} with…something. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} ignore it or ask the kid to stop?
P.E. Class
{0.SimFirstName}’s P.E. class gets to run laps—lots of them—to build their stamina and lung capacity. {M0.He}{F0.She} is mostly through the first lap when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a gap under the bleachers, just the right size for a little rest. Would Coach notice if {M0.he}{F0.she} sat out a few laps?
Unfinished Assignment
When {0.SimFirstName} gets to class, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes {M0.his}{F0.her} timeline is due, the one {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to start weeks ago. {M0.He}{F0.She} eyes the stack of papers piling up on {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher’s desk. All {M0.he}{F0.she} needs is a few minutes alone with one…Does {M0.he}{F0.she} try to copy a classmate’s, or confess the truth?
The Pink Bib
{0.SimFirstName} is sitting next to a new kid at lunch when {M0.he}{F0.she} spies something pink in his lunchbag. Is that a bib? The kid smiles nervously and claims that he got his baby sister’s lunch again. Then the bib falls out where everyone can see it. Pick it up or just ignore it?
Unsigned Slip
Field trip! {0.SimFirstName} is super excited for a trip to the Botanical Garden—until {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher asks for their permission slips. Whoops. {0.SimFirstName}’s is right there in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack, but it isn’t exactly signed. Forge it, or tell the teacher and risk getting left behind?
Missed Bubble
Another standardized test! {0.SimFirstName} is almost done when {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} skipped a bubble near the top. All {M0.his}{F0.her} answers are one off! {M0.He}{F0.She} starts to tell the teacher but realizes {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} have to take it again. It’s really only for the state—it doesn’t affect {M0.his}{F0.her} grade…
Dropped Cookie
{0.SimFirstName} is putting {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch on the lunch shelf when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that someone’s cookie has fallen out onto the ground. {0.SimFirstName} could return it to the open lunch bag that’s lying on its side, or just take care of the mess by eating the cookie {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.
Nerdy Loner
{0.SimFirstName} is playing alone at recess when a nerdy kid asks if {M0.he}{F0.she} can join in. There’s no real reason {M0.he}{F0.she} couldn’t…except that no one else ever lets {M0.him}{F0.her}. Will {0.SimFirstName} be the first?
Playground Split
{0.SimFirstName} is playing on the slide when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices that an upper grader has split her jeans. The tear is not in a good place, and a bit of pink cotton is showing through. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} let her know?
Turns out the clientele have money for expensive green smoothies AND financing local embezzlement schemes. Win win!
{0.SimFirstName} does it! The company offers {0.SimPronounObjective} the reward--but only if they can publish {M0.his}{F0.her} photo and real name for publicity. Forget it!
Oops. Turns out this &quot;Chonky Dog&quot; is actually the 7th dog to have the role. The Chonky company has a whole kennel full of 'em! There will be no ransom for poor #7.
{0.SimFirstName} won't release information just because {M0.he}{F0.she} can. People could get hurt, and the source of the info was more than a little shady.
{0.SimFirstName} crushes the rival thug. Everyone in both gangs learns a valuable lesson in messing with {M0.him}{F0.her}, and why not to do it.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to start a good old-fashioned street riot, but things escalate quickly. The disturbance gets so big that police swarm to the scene, and the bosses are forced to flee before sealing the deal.
{0.SimFirstName}'s crew were supposed to smuggle out a vertabra or leg bone. Instead they try to waltz out with the Pterodactyl's skull. It doesn't work!
Auditions go well. Everyone learns the sample heist choreography quickly, and a few of the essay-style answers on the written test are quite moving. By the end of the day, {0.SimFirstName} has cast an all-star new ring!
Yeah, tests are fun, but {0.SimFirstName} really shouldn't have asked his man to rappel through a skylight and steal the decorative tiles from City Hall's ceiling. Now that the LT has a broken back, {0.SimFirstName} is down a key player.
Security is very tight around the popular dinosaurs, meaning the Pterodactyl is completely unguarded! {0.SimFirstName}'s crew strolls out with the bone easily.
{0.SimFirstName} posts the spoilers because {M0.he}{F0.she} is a terrible person. The fans are pretty upset. Worse, the author now claims that she won't bother completing the final novel! The Oracle ruined everything!
{0.SimFirstName} pathetically tries to pass off a garbage bag and trash can lid as the height of nouveau fashion. Even the brickhead bouncer sees through {0.SimFirstName}'s disguise and throws {M0.him}{F0.her} out a second time. Into the trash.
After 48 hours of non-stop questioning, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly remembers that the cops hold their annual picnic down at the docks this time of year. Oops! Now the ring doesn't trust {0.SimFirstName} anymore.
How 'bout that? Turns out {0.SimFirstName}'s lieutenant can hijack an armored car—totally solo. Looks like that raise is deserved! And it's offset by the emeralds that were in the armored car.
The manifesto borrows a line from a conspiracy theory website {0.SimFirstName} put up years ago. People are starting to point out the connection! Not good...
{0.SimFirstName} asks for an autograph, like a gushing fan, while begging the bodyguard to snap a photo. Mid-snapshot, {M0.he}{F0.she} snatches the wallet, unseen. Who deserves an acting award now?
{0.SimFirstName} attempts to dislodge the cat from the window by tossing a rock at it. The kitten deftly leaps from the window and lands, claws first, on {0.SimFirstName}'s head. Hopefully the satisfaction of saving a life will help soothe those scratches.
The documents weren't real! They described a possible scenario, not events that actually took place! {0.SimFirstName} put {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation on the line for nothing.
{0.SimFirstName} has the strength advantage, but the thug has technique. {0.SimFirstName} is on the floor before {M0.he}{F0.she} knows what's happening. That's embarrassing!
{0.SimFirstName} overcorrects while spinning the car and it slams into the side of the bridge. One of the pursuing patrol cars misses it by inches! The crew barely manages to escape, but the getaway car is totaled.
Crime is a growth industry, and there just aren't enough qualified thugs to go around right now. And {0.SimFirstName} can't afford to pay relocation fees for out of town crooks. The new ring falls apart before it begins.
{0.SimFirstName} spends the next few hours posting cat memes, attributing famous quotes to the wrong people, and denying responsibility. In the end, no one believes {M0.he}{F0.she} could have accomplished much of anything. Phew!
After {0.SimFirstName} announces to ring members that they'll be interviewed, one by one, in the new &quot;interrogation room&quot; of {M0.his}{F0.her} own design, one of the goons immediately skips town. Snitch identified!
The bosses are pleased that {0.SimFirstName} ignored the obvious provocation. Just because {0.SimFirstName}'s the muscle doesn't mean {M0.he}{F0.she} shouldn't employ a little common sense.
{0.SimFirstName} posts the spoilers, but the ending is so bad no one believes {M0.him}{F0.her}! Now they're accusing The Oracle of writing bad fanfic! Guess that's why writers don't publish their first drafts...
{0.SimFirstName} manages to scrub all trace of {M0.himself}{F0.herself} from the interwebs. Boast? What boast? 
The look on that cook's face was priceless when {0.SimFirstName} burst through the freezer door, running, with fists full of tuna. Gotta appreciate the little moments...
As {0.SimFirstName} launches the getaway car perfectly over the gap in the bridge, {M0.he}{F0.she} regrets not getting that novelty car horn installed to punctuate the moment.
The manifesto is picked up by a major news source and anonymously republished. {0.SimFirstName} stays unrecognized by the mainstream but becomes an underground hero.
{0.SimFirstName} lights a trash can on fire, sets off a car alarm, and tosses a brick through a shop window. ({M0.He's}{F0.She's} a sucker for the classics.) Soon everyone joins the riot outside while the bosses' deal goes down quietly in back.
Knocking over the corner store is a total hit. The cash register has the necessary boost {0.SimFirstName} needed. Plus: free chips!
This is why planning counts. The best {0.SimFirstName} can do at the last second is robbing a food truck using a sock full of rocks. And all {M0.he}{F0.she} gets for the effort is a paltry couple of Simoleons and a really good grilled cheese sandwich with steak and mashed potatoes on it.
Let It Slide
Fight the Thug
{0.SimFirstName} freaks out and tries to settle the debate with a dance battle, which goes exactly as badly as one might think. The scariest part is the thugs who actually try to dance for their side! Nothing is settled.
{0.SimFirstName} leads an all-out brawl in the name of ski masks. They're timeless, and those clown masks are so last year! The gang agrees--or is scared to disagree--that ski masks are the way to go.
A less elegant solution, and really, really noisy, but it works! {0.SimFirstName} pops open the vault door and the crew starts to fill their sacks with Simoleons.
Oh, no! The drill triggered the autolock! There's no way to bust through in time now. {0.SimFirstName} will have to go back to the bosses empty handed.
Wait, didn't {0.SimFirstName} hear a rumor about a new virus called &quot;Triangle?&quot; The one that erases all your files and turns your desktop into a photo of a cat riding a unicorn? The Oracle cannot be fooled.
Give The Kid A Shot
Go One Man Down
{0.SimFirstName} loses the cash {M0.he}{F0.she} had set aside for the new XL-Series brass knuckles, but gains a crook's eternal loyalty. And who can put a price on that?
Whoops. Turns out Joe got caught on purpose -- part of an elaborate plan to bust his brother Stewie out of prison. And {0.SimFirstName} just bailed him out. Maybe now is not the best time to discuss reimbursement?
Ouch. The forum has decided that {0.SimFirstName}'s silence is equal to abject cowardice. {M0.His}{F0.Her} cred is totally damaged. Guess there's no high ground on the internet!
Whatever. {0.SimFirstName}'s hacking skills speak for themselves. So does the username &quot;awesomelf42.&quot;
Quick Fix
Ride It Out
An expert getaway driver always practices speed drills for car repairs. {0.SimFirstName} executes a world record tire change and burns rubber out of there.
Mid-tire change {0.SimFirstName} drops the hubcap and the nuts go flying in all directions. Oh fudge!! {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to get the spare on, but just in time. The rest of the crew is not pleased.
Shut it down. Shut it all down. {0.SimFirstName} can't risk the attention the malfunctioning script would bring. {M0.He}{F0.She} triggers the program's failsafe, causing it to return whatever money was set aside and then destroy itself.
{0.SimFirstName} makes {M0.his}{F0.her} case loudly and passionately online, achieving the same thing as thousands of other people complaining about thousands of other things just as loudly: nothing.
Sneak Back In
Street Fight
Pretend it was a Lie
Shut Down Account
Keep it Quiet
Publish It
Free information for everyone! Now everybody knows why they can light their kitchen faucets on fire.
After riling up all {M0.his}{F0.her} hacker friends for a huge corporate takedown, {0.SimFirstName} can't actually crack their security. Total humiliation.
Don't Feed the Trolls
Hack the Troll's Account
A thug from a rival gang is calling {0.SimFirstName} out, claiming {M0.he}{F0.she} hasn't got what it takes to be hired muscle. Should {0.SimFirstName} teach the thug a lesson or let it slide?
Down a Sim
It's the day before the big heist, and a rival gang pushed Sammy into a vat of cement. His wife is still trying to chip him out. Does {0.SimFirstName} let the super enthusiastic new kid take Sammy's role, or run the heist while down a man?
Flat Tire!
{0.SimFirstName}'s getaway car gets a flat tire at the worst possible time -- during a getaway! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} break out the tire iron for the world's fastest attempted fix or keep driving — on the rims?
Big deal's going down in the back of the club tonight. {0.SimFirstName}'s job is to start a distraction and keep attention off of the bosses. Unfortunately, the jerk bouncer isn't letting {M0.him}{F0.her} in! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} wear a disguise and sneak in, or start a fight in the street instead?
Not boasting about cyber crime is just. So. Hard. But {0.SimFirstName} brags about a hack on social media, and now the authorities may be on to {0.SimPronounObjective}. {M0.He}{F0.She} can delete all trace of {M0.his}{F0.her} social media account—or pretend the boast was a lie.
{0.SimFirstName} has hacked into a laptop owned by of the most popular writers alive! Now The Oracle holds the secrets to the last book in a best-selling series. Should The Oracle publish these spoilers?
Trash Talking
Ugh. Who IS &quot;awesomelf42&quot; anyway? Some trash talker on {0.SimFirstName}'s favorite forum is totally dissing {M0.his}{F0.her} hacking skills. Of course, proving that troll wrong is as simple as hacking into his account. But they say not to feed the trolls.
{0.SimFirstName} cracked the code on this five-star joint's locked freezer. The score? Bluefin tuna, worth mega bucks. One problem: The door shut, locking {0.SimPronounObjective} in! {0.SimFirstName} has got to escape before {M0.he}{F0.she} starts having flashbacks of {M0.his}{F0.her} previous adventures! {0.SimFirstName} can either phone a friend or make a break for it when a cook shows up to work.
Which Mask?
Crisis! Half the crew wants to wear ski masks to the next heist, half insists on clown masks. This thug fashion-off has come to blows. As Ringleader, should {0.SimFirstName} get involved and pick a side—or step aside and stay neutral?
{0.SimFirstName} has been contacted by a member of a government agency with secret docs that could incite a riot if they got out. Does {0.SimFirstName} help release them anonymously, or is it better not to have a riot on {M0.his}{F0.her} hands?
Virus Alert
The anti-virus alert is flashing in the middle of {0.SimFirstName}'s attempt to compose a genius email scam (&quot;I am your twin, a prince. You won the lottery mega bonus!&quot;) Should {M0.he}{F0.she} investigate it — or ignore it and keep serving up spam?
Corporate Misinformation
A corporation is leaking waste into a town's drinking water supply and sitting on coverup docs. {0.SimFirstName} can't wait for the authorities to force information release. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take down the corporation's firewall, or cause negative publicity by complaining on the internet?
Paper Bag
Everyone's trying to make a deal in this park. So that paper bag, stashed behind the trash bin—well, it's probably not full of sandwiches. It could be a setup, though. {0.SimFirstName} can either swipe the bag or leave it alone.
