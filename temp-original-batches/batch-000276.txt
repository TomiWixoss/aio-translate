Mt. Komorebi
Locals have enjoyed the healing hot springs of Mt. Komorebi for centuries. Now, thanks to the modern snow sports resort in Yukimatsu, everyone else can, too! The region has become a hotspot for tourists looking for a vacation that's equal parts relaxing and adventurous. With so many new visitors, there have been a lot of changes to the rolling forests that surround Mt. Komorebi. Hopefully, the area will be able to maintain the charm that drew so many Sims to it in the first place.
