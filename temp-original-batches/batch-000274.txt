Ondarion
The regal Kingdom of Ondarion takes its name from the emerald sea that unites its three great shores. It is upon these same coastlines that three distinct cultures, connected by one sea, live together and exchange traditions. Together they have forged a grand legacy of Nobility and aristocratic Dynasties, which has lasted for countless generations. To this day the Nobles of Ondarion duel each other through political plays and battles of succession, in the race to the ultimate goal: the Kingdom's Royal Crown.
