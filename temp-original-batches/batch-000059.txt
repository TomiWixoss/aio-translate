At the end of a very close match, {0.SimFirstName} just couldn’t pull it together for the win. Better luck next time!
“ALL THE POINTS ARE BELONG TO {0.SimFirstName|xxAllCaps},” the game proclaims, in a big retro font, as the match ends. {0.SimFirstName} is a digital champion!
Zap! Vroom! Dag Dag! {0.SimFirstName} demolished the competition in a display of virtual mastery. No one will be calling {M0.him}{F0.her} a n00b anytime soon.
Wow, that was pretty pathetic. A group of annoying teenagers that joined the online match were laughing at how bad {0.SimFirstName} was the whole time!
It was a tight competition, but {0.SimFirstName} saving that power-up for the last few seconds was a smart move. {M0.His}{F0.Her} opponents didn’t see it coming!
The game isn't over! Did the servers just disconnect?
Everyone loses a game now and then. It happens! {0.SimFirstName} unfortunately lost at this game.
