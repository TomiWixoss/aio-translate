[Redacted]
After hitting a ceiling with the Good Guys, {0.SimFirstName}’s trying {M0.his}{F0.her} hand at some Evil. Hey, that’s where the real money is! If it works out, {M0.he}{F0.she} may switch over to Evil full time....
Double Agent
In the world of a spy, every stranger is a potential assassin. Every situation is a potential ambush. Fueled with adrenaline, {0.SimFirstName} lives fast and lives dangerously. {M0.He}{F0.She} also wears a lot of cool disguises. 
Secret Agent
{0.SimFirstName} feels a deep sense of patriotism serving the greater good. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} protecting {M0.his}{F0.her} countrymen from harm, performing a vital public service. Once these feelings wear off, {M0.he}{F0.she} can head back into the private sector and actually make some money.   
Government Agent
Running major cases is just like running any mid-size organization. It’s all about managing personnel, budgets, and the bottom line. The big difference is that if {0.SimFirstName} fails, the world blows up.  Other than that, it’s pretty much the same.  
Lead Detective
According to movies, as a field agent {0.SimFirstName} should immediately expect to go undercover to infiltrate a religious cult, street racing ring, or beauty pageant. Until then {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} be interviewing a lot of tinfoil hat-wearers about the radio transmitters implanted in their teeth. Allegedly. 
Field Agent
Run. Duck. JUDO CHOP THAT BAD GUY RIGHT NOW. {0.SimFirstName} loves giving orders. {M0.His}{F0.Her} agents will feel safe in {M0.his}{F0.her} capable hands, and {M0.he}{F0.she} can feel fulfilled being able to live {M0.his}{F0.her} spy fantasies vicariously through their adventures.  
Agent Handler
 Friendly Interactions ({0.String})
{M0.His}{F0.Her} security clearance is pretty low, but {0.SimFirstName}'s still learning some cool secrets. Since {0.SimFirstName}'s been analyzing intelligence, {0.SimFirstName}'s learned the real speed limit, a code word that allows {0.SimPronounObjective} to use any employees-only restroom, and the truth about the moon landing in the 30’s. 
Intelligence Researcher
Before {0.SimFirstName} can conduct international espionage and eliminate targets, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got to process some expense reports. And answer some phones. The occasional bagel run.... Exciting stuff!
Agency Clerk
Besides getting to wear a ton of incredible formalwear and sip drinks with perilously attractive strangers, {0.SimFirstName} also gets to gamble at foreign casinos with agency money. Being an international superspy is exactly as amazing as it sounds.
Double Diamond Agent
The day that {0.SimFirstName} made Shadow Agent, they took away {M0.his}{F0.her} thumbprints and driver’s license. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} a ghost, a specter, a silent entity slipping through motion-detecting security systems and floating through embassies. And sometimes doing a little light paperwork.
Shadow Agent
These young agents today, they don’t even understand how tough it was in the old days. Why, when {0.SimFirstName} assassinated {M0.his}{F0.her} first target, {M0.he}{F0.she} had to bury the body {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. With {M0.his}{F0.her} hands! Kids today, they’ve got it too easy. 
Spy Captain
{0.SimFirstName} has boldly painted {M0.his}{F0.her} way into a career in studio art—mastering still life, figure study, interior space, and the fine art of disdain for anyone living in mainstream society.
Imaginative Imagist
{0.SimFirstName} has landed a spot in an elite local painter's group, and {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio is growing quite large! Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should try building {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio with photographs instead of the original paintings....
Canvas Creator
{0.SimFirstName} is now a working artist! At least {M0.he}{F0.she}'s working a booth at a local art fair, where patrons are haggling down the price of {M0.his}{F0.her} watercolored landscapes. But the words &quot;work&quot; and &quot;artist&quot; are coming closer together. And that's a good sign!
Watercolor Dabbler
Being a hungry artist isn't about literal hunger. It's about {0.SimFirstName}'s burning passion to create an artistic expression that can change people's lives! (It's also about literal hunger.)
Hungry Artist
Saving up for art school supplies means working at the art school library. Unfortunately, the books must be re-shelved by number, and no one sees the genius in {0.SimFirstName} re-shelving them by complementary color. Visionaries are often misunderstood.
Art Book Collator
To create great art, one must suffer. {0.SimFirstName} is well on {M0.his}{F0.her} way to greatness, as {M0.he}{F0.she} will be asked to create floor-based installations using a water-based medium (i.e. mopping the floor).
Palette Cleaner
{0.SimFirstName}'s private collection has gained such widespread fame that {M0.he}{F0.she} now spends {M0.his}{F0.her} days negotiating with museums that want to display it. As long as they each build the &quot;{0.SimFirstName} Wing&quot;, with a bronze plaque of {0.SimFirstName}'s face, no problem!
Patron of the Arts
With a reputation like {0.SimFirstName}'s it's no wonder the museum would settle for no one else to curate their contemporary art collection. {0.SimFirstName} is a scholar and a master of unconventional work. That neon-boxer-shorts-displayed-in-a-bouncy-castle exhibit? Genius!
Composition Curator
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but money is in the eye of the appraiser. {0.SimFirstName} draws on {M0.his}{F0.her} significant training to determine the value of fine art, letting others know that not every paint-covered canvas is created equal.
Fine-Art Aficionado
{0.SimFirstName} now spends equal amounts of time improving {M0.his}{F0.her} own technique and politely suggesting how other artists can improve theirs. It allows interaction with the greatest talents of this generation, even if those interactions are sometimes prickly.
Color Theory Critic
Students now flock to {0.SimFirstName}, hoping to glean even a bit of the technique that has made {M0.his}{F0.her} artwork so popular. Time to pass on what {M0.he}{F0.she} has learned to the next generation, or just wave {M0.his}{F0.her} paintbrush and sigh, &quot;Hopeless!&quot;
Master of the Real
Professional illustrator is a challenging role. {0.SimFirstName} controls the final visual, but does not control the subject matter. Whether it's a famous historical figure or a cartoon squirrel, {M0.he}{F0.she} is up to the task! 
Illustrious Illustrator
{0.SimFirstName} just hung some work in the hottest gallery in town! And it's actually {M0.his}{F0.her} work this time! This is a wonderful achievement for any artist.
Professional Painter
Winning this artist residency is a true honor! Not everyone gets to work in an unheated barn loft for free. What a great way for {0.SimFirstName} to experience a slice of life {M0.he}{F0.she} would never actually choose! 
Artist en Residence
Okay, so... Not every child is going to get school right away. Don’t worry! Every student starts somewhere, and with a little effort {0.SimFirstName} will bring those grades up in no time. Even writing {M0.his}{F0.her} name on the test is worth a few points!  
We're a hot new Sillisim Valley startup, and we need to make a splash with an eye-grabbing professional logo before raising further capital in our Series B funding round. Look, don't get bogged down in the details... This is a simple job. And don't even think about asking to get paid in stock grants (fat chance we'll give an artist equity before our eventual record smashing IPO.) You give us a hot logo; we give you Simoleons.
Icons for Sims Forever

Fans of the game are clamoring for something new though, and we're getting to work on yet another expansion pack for the seminal title. Can you help take Sims Forever to the next level? We need to outsource icon art to someone who's proficient at visualizing moodlets, headlines, whims, traits, aspirations, and more with minimal guidance. Get in the game!
