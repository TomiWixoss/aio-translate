Waste of Time
First, it took {0.SimFirstName}'s money... THEN, it didn't give {M0.him}{F0.her} the item. NOW, it &lt;i&gt;denies&lt;/i&gt; {M0.him}{F0.her} justice even after a good shake! The nerve!

{0.SimFirstName} pays. {0.SimFirstName} gets item. That's how it's &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to work, Mr. Vending Machine. That's how it's &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to work. Nothing's more frustrating than losing Simoleons with nothing in return.
