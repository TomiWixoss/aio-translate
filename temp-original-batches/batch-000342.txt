Tomato Soup
Also known as Sliced Rice Cake Soup, it is a traditional Korean dish eaten during the celebration of the Korean New Year. The dish consists of the broth/soup (guk) with thinly sliced rice cakes (tteok). It is tradition to eat tteokguk on New Year's Day because it is believed to grant the people good luck for the year and gain a year of age.\n\nThe origin of eating tteokguk on New Year's Day is unknown. However, tteokguk is mentioned in the 19th-century book of customs Dongguksesigi (동국세시기, 東國歲時記) with the custom of having a bowl of tteokguk in the morning of New Year's Day to get a year older, and the custom of saying &quot;How many bowls of tteokguk have you eaten?&quot; to ask a person's age. How many bowls have you eaten?\n\nLactose Free

Cook Steamed Fish
There is a Chinese saying that explains how important fish dishes are to Chinese cuisine: 无鱼不成席 (Wú Yú Bù Chéng Xí) - meaning that you can’t call it a feast if there is no fish present. Fish prepared in this fashion are the centerpiece of a multi-course meal, either for special occasions or festivals.\n\nFor this recipe, the fish is steamed with its tail, head, and fins intact to best preserve the natural taste of the fish. Some people have variations of seasonings to add their special touch, but usually it is seasoned with a simple soy sauce based dressing with scallions and ginger. If you want to add a bit of heat, some dried chili can be added.\n\nLactose Free

Make Pão de Queijo
These are not merely cheese buns, these are THE cheese buns to go for. Pão de queijo or literally translated to Cheese Bread, is a popular snack and/or breakfast food in Brazil.\n\nIts origins date to when Minas Gerais cooks replaced the non-existent wheat with starch derived from cassava shown to them by tupiniquins indigenous groups. Added this was grated hard cheese similar to Parmesan later at the end of the 19th century.\n\nCuriously, this recipe is also widely eaten in northern Argentina and is inexpensive, often sold from street-side stands by vendors carrying a heat-preserving container. In Brazil, it is also very commonly found in groceries, supermarkets and bakeries, industrialized or freshly made. Enjoy!\n\nVegetarian-Safe
