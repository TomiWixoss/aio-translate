{0.SimFirstName} used to run a company, and now {0.SimFirstName} runs several. Fortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got smart folks in key positions, so {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got more free time to enjoy life... and the private jet.
Business Tycoon
This is it: the big chair. {0.SimFirstName} makes the moves and {M0.he}{F0.she} calls the shots. It feels good to be the {M0.king}{F0.queen}, doesn't it? Well, it probably would if {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't have the board of shareholders breathing down {M0.his}{F0.her} neck for results all day.
CEO
The corner office is {0.SimFirstName}'s. Everyone looks to {M0.him}{F0.her} for leadership. Too bad the CEO still calls the shots, but someday...
President
{0.SimFirstName} now has the key to the executive washroom! Responsibilities are great, but so are the rewards. It's going to take top-level people skills to make it to the top of this corporate ladder.

{0.SimFirstName} has proved {M0.himself}{F0.herself} as a manager, but {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got {M0.his}{F0.her} sights set on the next level. Whether {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to be an executive or a financial whiz, it's time to put the effort in and make it happen.
Senior Manager
{0.SimFirstName}'s the {M0.man}{F0.woman} now! ... Or at least the manager of a region of the company. That means {M0.he}{F0.she}'s got to keep working on {M0.his}{F0.her} people skills if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants an even bigger slice of the pie.
Regional Manager
This is it... almost. Ok, so {0.SimFirstName}'s not a manager, yet. Surely {M0.he}{F0.she}'s next in line for the position. It's time to build those people skills for when {M0.he}{F0.she} has people to boss about, er... manage.
Assistant Manager
It's not quite management track, but it's the next best thing, isn't it? After all, the manager only has one assistant...
Assistant to the Manager
It's amazing how much assistance an office needs. The more energy {0.SimFirstName} has, the more {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll get done. The better {M0.his}{F0.her} social skills, the more recognition {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll receive.
Office Assistant
Far from the days when postal correspondence was the lifeblood of a thriving business, today's mailrooms have been made all but obsolete with the rise of email. Still, somebody's gotta distribute all the online shopping deliveries! {0.SimFirstName} will have to keep {M0.his}{F0.her} energy level up to get noticed... and elevated from the mailroom. {M0.He}{F0.She} can now Fill Out Reports on the computer and Gossip About Office Romances.
Safe Cracker
 Upgrade Objects ({0.String})
{0.SimFirstName} has taken {M0.his}{F0.her} talents into the mean streets, rocking getaway cars up on two wheels, hugging corners, running from cops. This stuff would make a pretty exciting video game!
Getaway Driver
From knocking out armed guards to intimidating rival gangs with a single arched eyebrow, {0.SimFirstName} is now the brawn behind the brains.  And {M0.he's}{F0.she's} closer to the action than ever. Don't mess with {M0.him}{F0.her}!
The Muscle
There's no trade route too treacherous, no cargo too controversial for {0.SimFirstName} to covertly ship across the universe and into {M0.his}{F0.her} customers' covetous hands. Capitalism is capitalism. And a 2000% markup is a 2000% markup.
Want the horn of an endangered zygax? How about a quilt handmade from 2,000 tiny Q505Bs? Maybe just a few Gibsonian chill-out pods for the big party next weekend? {0.SimFirstName} doesn't ask questions. {M0.He}{F0.She} just makes it happen. 
Any ranger who's quick with a laser can make more Simoleons in private security than serving the public good. {0.SimFirstName} protects galactic warlords, exterminates cabals of tribal terrorists, and helps corrupt governments maintain plausible deniability. 
When the universe is in danger, one {M0.man}{F0.woman} gets the call: {0.SimFirstName}, Space Ranger! With {M0.his}{F0.her} stout heart, keen wits, and a phozoplasmic Warp Pack strapped to {M0.his}{F0.her} back, Ranger {0.SimFirstName} defends the known galaxies from evil!
This here galaxy's {0.SimFirstName}'s jurisdiction now. Even-handed with the punishment and generous with the attitude, {M0.he}{F0.she} don't take no nonsense from alien punks, no matter now many tentacles or ocular cavities or rows of teeth they have. Also, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to talk like a sheriff!
{0.SimFirstName}'s drawn a pretty good beat. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} patrolling planet Illustria, which is scenic and upscale, with nice shops and restaurants. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't get the Bloodwar planet, which is also pretty scenic but has fewer restaurants. 
This is it: Astronaut. The best of the best. The heroic few. The job kids want to be when they grow up that they still want to be as adults. {0.SimFirstName} will now go boldly into that great beyond to explore the secrets of the universe and eat weird freeze-dried ice cream.
{0.SimFirstName} was hoping that if {M0.he}{F0.she} &quot;accidentally&quot; derailed a shuttle-board &quot;simulation&quot; {M0.he}{F0.she} might be able to launch the shuttle and get to space…but it turns out that actual spacecraft are pretty well-secured. That's good, because {0.SimFirstName} is still learning how to space brake and star park.
Low orbit is where the real action is-satellites, space stations, space walks, daredevils attempting to break the world record for high-altitude parachuting. If something goes wrong, it's also the closest place to breathable air, which is why {0.SimFirstName} likes it.  
Guiding virtual rockets into place, analyzing the movements of blinking dots on a computer screen, running simulations.... Looks like all those hours {0.SimFirstName} spent playing video games are paying off! 
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't think of {M0.himself}{F0.herself} as just a glorified mechanic. The shuttle costs billions of Simoleons, and any screw-ups would cost lives. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} more like a glorified engineer.  
 Play Chess ({0.String})
{0.SimFirstName} has always loved being under the sun! After all, {F0.she}{M0.he} is strong, energetic, and loves the smell of freshly cut grass. And grass is green, so simoleons must smell like grass! That, or lawnmower exhaust. Either way, mowing lawns is a great work out for {F0.her}{M0.him}!
{0.SimFirstName} is continuing their babysitting adventure by securing a job at The Munchkin Menagerie's Holding Hands Daycare. Working with a loving, experienced team of childcare professionals, {F0.she}{M0.he} will help provide a gentle, caring and stimulating environment that honors the genius in every child.
Daycare Admin
Little-known fact: Space is an absolutely filthy place. When the shuttles return, guess who gets to hose them down and scrub off the gunk? {0.SimFirstName} hopes the goo is just dirt and not some incurable form of Oozing Space Measles.  
{0.SimFirstName}'s always had dreams about exploring the cosmos, walking among the stars, and discovering places unknown. {M0.His}{F0.Her} journey begins here, in the file room, categorizing expense reports.&#xD;&#xA;
Has Anyone Ever Thought of This?
