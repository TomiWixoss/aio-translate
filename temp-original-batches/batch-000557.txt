This is horrible! I didn't wait this long for my new phone on opening day. I'm out of here.
I could have grown and cooked my own food by this point. This is unacceptable. I'm leaving!
Hmm... training after my shift. Are you helping me improve or are you trying to tell me I'm not good enough? Either way, I better study hard.
Thanks, I appreciate you investing in my future here! I'll go to a class next time I'm off work!
Thank you {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}. This will be a great opportunity to refine my skills. I'll go after my shift.
Great, just what I wanted, a chance to go to a class in my off time.
Off site training? Will there be an obstacle course? Don't tell me. I want it to be a surprise.
It is so good to hear the extra effort I've been putting in is noticed. Thank you!&#xA;
Wonderful. I try to be a model employee and it looks like my effort is paying off.&#xA;
The appreciation feels great. Keep the compliments rolling in. I can't get enough of them.&#xA;
Thanks for the feedback {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms} {0.SimLastName}! I won't let it go to my head.
Thank you {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}! I think I'm pretty awesome as well.
That was better than any poster I've ever read.
110%? After that speech I'm giving 120%!
A buzzword free inspirational speech. I'm inspired because you managed to pull that off.
Yes! This is our time! We can do it.&#xA;
I'm ready! I can do it! I believe in myself! Thanks for the pep talk boss.&#xA;
I'll work harder, I promise.&#xA;
Why are you so hard on me {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}? I'm doing my best.
I'll shape up and stop making mistakes. I just didn't sleep well last night.
I'm so ashamed. I didn't mean to mess up. Please don't put this on my permanent record.&#xA;
But... but... but... I've been trying to not mess up.
I'm motivated by my desire to stay employed.
How am I feeling about my job? Meh!
Things are going well. I feel I'm really starting to stretch my work skills.
I don't want to be too critical, but maybe if you put me in charge I could turn things around.&#xA;
I don't know why I'm still here. I couldn't be more unhappy.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to make the employee of the month.&#xA;
I don't know how much more of this I can take. You will miss me when I'm gone.
I'm feeling really fulfilled in my current role. It couldn't get much better.&#xA;
Things here are great! You're a fantastic boss and I couldn't be happier.
Things are okay. I can't say this is my dream career though.&#xA;
I like working here. My co-workers are all really fun to work with.
You are terrible, these co-workers are terrible, this whole place is terrible.&#xA;
Things could be better if you spent a little more time paying attention to the business.&#xA;
It's great working with you {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}. I feel you are a fair boss.
Who needs weekends when your job is this good?&#xA;
I'm doing okay boss.  Nothing new to report.
I love this job! I think I found my true calling.
I'm underpaid and overqualified.&#xA;
The customers don't seem to appreciate my work right now. At least they are not complaining either.&#xA;
You're a terrible boss. I wish that you weren't, but you are. Every day.
Things are not going well. I feel like I'm the only one working around here.&#xA;
Work is what work is... It's just a means to an end for me.
Listen {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}, maybe you should spend more time on the business than on checking with me.
I'm almost tempted to stay here for some overtime. Almost...
The work here is rewarding. We get along well, and I feel valued. I'm satisfied with that.

Hi there! My name is Nanny {0.SimLastName}, nice to meet you!\n\nI am sensibly sufficient in every way. I can play, cook, and mentor!\n\nAnd yes, I’m not opposed to changing diapers and cleaning up messes, if needed. Let’s have a fun day together!
Hello! How are you doing today? It is delightful to see you again!
You are learning so fast {1.SimFirstName}! Excellent!
Sometimes bearing your soul through a series of revealing cards that are delivered an entire class of teenagers isn't a good idea. This was probably one of those times. While {0.SimFirstName} went in a more sensitive direction, everyone else went comedic, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} is the laughing stock of the class. Maybe in a week everyone will stop talking in goo-goo voices to {M0.him}{F0.her}.
Who takes {1.String} seriously, anyways? Those kids with sappy cards were, well… saps! Not {0.SimFirstName}. Everyone who opened {M0.his}{F0.her} cards had a good laugh. Now {0.SimFirstName} is considered the funniest kid in school. Who knew {0.SimFirstName} could be such a comedian?
Apparently {0.SimFirstName} isn’t funny. The teacher didn’t think so. {M0.His}{F0.Her} classmates didn’t think so. Even {0.SimFirstName}’s friends didn’t think so. The word being thrown around is ‘insensitive.” Apparently, {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to start taking people’s feelings a little bit more seriously and maybe not mock holidays that others hold dear.
{0.SimFirstName} decided to buy flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and make it seem like {M0.he}{F0.she} was popular! The rouse was a success until lunch when the school bully pulled {0.SimFirstName} aside and announced that they knew…\n\nThankfully, the bully thought it was funny, and {0.SimFirstName} got off scot-free (and with {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch money)!
{0.SimFirstName} decided to buy flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and make it seem like {M0.he}{F0.she} was popular! Unfortunately, the plan backfired and {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates were jealous. Instead of looking cool, {0.SimFirstName} spent the rest of the day ignored…
{0.SimFirstName} decided to surprise the entire class with flowers! While sitting in math, each flower was hand-delivered, taking enough time to get them out of a test!
{0.SimFirstName} decided to surprise the entire class with flowers! Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot to sign the cards and when the flowers were delivered another kid took credit. What a crummy {1.String}!
