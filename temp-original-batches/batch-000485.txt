Multicolor Pool Trim
A pool is the only place where having a trim adds and doesn’t subtract.  No one would go to a barber, say “I just want a trim” and leave with more hair than they came with. They should call it a border. So get a border and go for a dip. Let no weird nomenclature get in the way of your relaxing swim.
