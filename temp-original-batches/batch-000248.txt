{1.SimFirstName} and I just welcomed home our new baby! Are you able to stop by?
I have some exciting news {0.SimFirstName}! {1.SimFirstName} and I just had our baby; would you be up for coming over and saying hello?

I'm the parent of a newly adopted toddler, {0.SimFirstName}! I'm so excited, but also very nervous. If you have any spare time would you want to come by?

Hi, neighbor. Just letting you know that I moved in nearby. Maybe… come over if you want? Don’t be a stranger!

Visit a Neighbor's Home
Hey, {0.SimFirstName}, it's me, {1.SimFirstName}. I don't know about you, but I felt like we had an instant connection... Can I take you out to my favorite place?
{2.SimFirstName} is such a jerk, you were right about {M2.him}{F2.her}.
{1.SimFirstName} and I have a little bun in the oven. I can't describe to you how excited I am to be having a baby!
{0.SimFirstName}, I wanted to let you know that I'm pregnant! {1.SimFirstName} and I will be expecting a little one soon!
Baby News! {1.SimFirstName} and I are pregnant, and I wanted to make sure you heard it from me first.
Thanks, I'll call him Lewis
Major Sancho to Ground Control! It's good to see you, Nova. By the way, I brought you a Space Slug from Sixam. Isn't he cute? It's the perfect pet, you don't even have to feed him! He's very gassy, though...
Yes - Cash is trash!
No - I worked so hard to get here!
I've had the best idea! We understand each other and we work well as a... team, right? What if we created our own game or app together and became indie developers? No one could fire us ever again! Come on, {0.SimFirstName}? Let’s stick it to the man! I'll share with you the secret beverage I use to boost performance. If you start coding right after you drink this, you'll level your programming skill in no time!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I hope you’re not working too hard! Remember to use some of those precious vacation days to chill!
Thanks for allowing me to crash at your place, {0.SimFirstName}. I got you this Space Print as an apology for being a jerk. It reminded me of the night we spent at your dad's observatory... Not that I think about it often or anything. Place it near your computer and activate it, it will help you boost your programming skill gain! And again, sorry for being a supercompetitive tuna head.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! Guess what, I got promoted too! I used my bonus to buy furniture and MADE. IT. RAIN. I got lots of flashy new items that will quickly get me into a good mood so I’ll have EVEN MORE time for career advancement. Smart, huh? You gotta spend money to make money! I gotta admit, I’m surprised you were promoted as well… Must’ve been luck! When I’m your manager I’ll make sure mistakes like that don’t happen again.\n&#xD;&#xA;
I'll buy stuff with my bonus too!
Should I trust &quot;The New Lewis&quot;?
Grrr, stop self-inviting yourself!
Learned to Creep
After learning to roll over in both directions, continued practice with &lt;b&gt;Tummy Time&lt;/b&gt; will help {0.SimFirstName} build muscle and increase coordination to allow {0.SimPronounObjective} to start creeping.
Watch out world, {0.SimFirstName} is on the loose! Having learned to crawl, there's no shortage of mischief {0.SimPronounSubjective}'ll be able to get up to.

The world just got a bit brighter with {0.SimFirstName}'s very first smile!

Learned to Wave
{0.SimFirstName} is getting stronger every day. What a momentous occasion when {0.SimPronounSubjective} can wiggle around, bend over, and even stick {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} toe in {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} mouth. How flexible!
Put Toe In Mouth
Playing with toybox toys, dollhouses, blocks, and the Infant Playmat will help {0.SimFirstName} progress through {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} Fine Motor milestones!
Aim high and reach far! {0.SimFirstName} first reached for the {2.ObjectName}, but the sky's the limit! Who knows what {0.SimPronounSubjective} will reach for next?
Learned to Reach
Using the Infant Playmat to &lt;b&gt;Look At Toys&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Play With Infant&lt;/b&gt; will eventually lead to {0.SimFirstName} reaching for things all on {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} own!
{0.SimFirstName}'s powerful fingers are now able to perform the Pincer Grasp! Nothing will escape from {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} fingers unless {0.SimPronounSubjective} wills it!
