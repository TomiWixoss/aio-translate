Invite {1.SimFirstName} to Stay the Night
Appreciate you letting me crash here for the night while I get myself together. I honestly expected you to laugh in my face. Thanks, {0.SimFirstName}, I won't forget this.  
Invite the Sim to sleep at your house for the night. 
I'm not sure what I was thinking. Why did I expect you of all people to help me? You've always been so eager to be the best and rub your accomplishments in my face. I bet you'd just loving this. Well, you better enjoy this moment, {0.SimFirstName}, because I promise you, I'm not going to rest until I climb back to the top. Game on, loser.
