Congratulations! You have a Horse! Owning a Horse is a way of life that requires hard work, training, and lots of care.\n\nTo properly care for a Horse, you'll need a handful of items. Stock up from Build Mode through &lt;b&gt;Objects by Room&lt;/b&gt;: go to the &lt;b&gt;Outdoors&lt;/b&gt; section and then &lt;b&gt;Animals&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nHelpful items may include:\n\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Animal Feeder&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Horse Water Trough&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! Horse Bed&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Hay Now! One Big Ball&lt;/b&gt;\n⚒ &lt;b&gt;Horse Jumps or Barrels&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&#xA;
The Horse is in a &lt;font color='#1E81E6'&gt;neutral Mood&lt;/font&gt;, which has no impact on the chances of winning.
This Horse is in a &lt;font color='#008000'&gt;positive Mood&lt;/font&gt;, which slightly improves the chances of winning.
This Horse is asleep, which has no impact on the chances of winning.
This Horse is in a &lt;font color='#ff0000'&gt;negative Mood&lt;/font&gt;, which slightly reduces the chances of winning.

{1.String} Successful!!
{1.String} was awesome! {0.SimFirstName} had a wonderful time and got to do everything {M0.he}{F0.she} planned to do.
{1.String} was Awful!
{1.String} really wasn't up to {0.SimFirstName}'s expectations. {M0.He}{F0.She} didn't get to participate in enough of the traditions {M0.he}{F0.she} likes. Maybe next year.
{1.String} is Over!
{1.String} was pretty good! {0.SimFirstName} got to do a lot of the things {M0.he}{F0.she} wanted to do... but... not everything. Next year {M0.he}{F0.she} hopes to do even more!
Prepare to participate in all your favorite traditions.

Challenge Scenarios
{0.SimFirstName} ran out of {2.ObjectCatalogName} to use as bait. {M0.He}{F0.She} will continue fishing without bait.
There's some fancy fish here that only nibble on flowers.
Discerning fish here enjoy the freshest of produce. Try some fruit on the line.
The rarest catches here are at the top of the food-chain. Baiting your line with a medium-sized fish might just lure them out.
Most fish here will eat almost anything - as long as it's organic, they're biting!
Some fish really need a bait they can sink their teeth into.
Prized catches here like to prey on small fish. Poor, small fish. 
Some fish here prefer munching on amphibians. Try using a Frog for bait.
These fish are biting at anything. As long as it's valuable, they're going for it!

Select Sim to Forge Connection
{0.SimName}'s familiar needs more room to answer their master's summons.
The preeminent symbol of magic and ancient knowledge. They have a strong connection to the moon and stoically follow their chosen Spellcaster.
When you need a protector that truly frightens your opponent consider the skull. It is hard not to be intimidated by this floating, haunting familiar.
Regal and powerful, this dragon should never be discounted based on its size. It is a formidable foe as well as a cherished companion.
Pure energy coalesced in the form of a tiny fairy familiar, it is impossible to make out any features beyond its magical wings. One can feel what can only be described as a slight spark when near.
Be warned to avoid the direct gaze of the glowfrog. They are usually quite mischievous characters although quite harmless when left to their own devices.
