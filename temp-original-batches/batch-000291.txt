This section displays Sims without a designated residential interested in this unit, including played and not played households. The Rent Cap for each household represents the maximum amount of Rent Per Day they can afford. Look for the green checkmark, as it indicates a compatible match ready to move in. It's also a good idea to choose a household with a Beds Wanted count that matches the number of beds available in this Unit.
