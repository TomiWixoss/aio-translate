Figured It Out
Pulling up one's sleeves to learn on the job is rewarding.
Secret Admirer
It seems the secret admirer is no longer a secret. What to do next?
Not Paid
Freelancers aren't volunteers. Writers should be paid for their work!
Missed Deadline
Missing a crucial deadline is a blow to one's morale. Sigh.
Not contributing in a group project shouldn't mean getting the same grade as those who did the work.
Lower Grade
My boss is such a kidder. He wouldn't have taken me out.
Heckler Shutdown
That heckler probably wishes he'd never spoken up.
Flubbed Attempt
Time to figure out how to deal with hecklers.
Hey now! A few extra Simoleons certainly improved THIS life moment.
Class Gossip
Being the topic of gossip is so miserable.
A great grade without having to do any work? Perfect!
A+ Project
Writing Praised
Smelly Tirade
The only thing that stinks more than being yelled at is being yelled at by someone who smells this bad.
There's nothing wrong with being perfectly average, right?
Perfect C Student
P.E. Nap
Exercise will burn energy, but naps will re-energize!
Sometimes, keeping your head down and working is the best route to take.
No News is Good News
You have to stay alert in this business, or the news will pass you by.
Caught Napping
That nap was really quite nice, at least until the Coach interrupted it.
Someone Else in Trouble
Sometimes, people get what's coming to them.
Sent into the Hall
Being bothered in class is bad enough, but getting in trouble for it is infuriating.
Riot Stories
It's always exhilarating to perform for friends.
The only thing worse than a long day at school is a long night of homework.
Mountain of Homework
It feels great to only have reading left over and be done with everything else!
