Cool, Thanks!
Game Options
Welcome to Sims Delivery Express our new Base Game content drop system!\n\nThis system will be able to deliver short bursts of content without requiring a Game Update so everything will be done in the background. You just need to restart after the downloads are completed and enjoy!\n\nYou can expect the following:&lt;ul type=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Build mode or Create A Sim content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny game fixes, those that don't need a Game Update to be delivered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\nIn the future, we hope to maybe expand this list but for now we hope you enjoy every upcoming Sims Delivery! To find out more, check out the settings for this system in the Game Options Menu.
