Theoretical Electronics by Nikolai Volt
Nikolai theorized that a time travel component could be built with:\n\n• A piece of Ironyum\n• A piece of Plathinum\n• A common electronic component\n\nAnd one other item which must contain the essence of time...but he was unable to discover what held time!

IOU Note

The History of Time Travel
It is both now and ever, long and short, and started when someone tried to fix past mistakes. In doing so, the fabric of time itself crystalized and became something material.\n\nIt goes on to say that while some believe books, movies, or even video games are merely windows into the past, others believe they may be a form of time travel itself.
A little knowledge of time travel might help on where to begin!\n\nGo to a Library Venue, and select Read History of Time Travel from a bookshelf.\n\n&lt;i&gt;(+25 Event Points)&lt;/i&gt;

That helped put things into perspective!\n\nMaybe it's best to take some time, and continue the search for clues after regrouping.
