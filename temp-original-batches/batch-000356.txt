{0.SimFirstName} presses on {M0.his}{F0.her} headset and tries to focus, but an overexcited fan crashes into {0.SimPronounObjective} and spills “N-ergy Drynk” all over the keyboard. Photos of the resulting brawl quickly go viral, which doesn’t do much for {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation.
Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} makes a fabulous presentation. If only the partner had heard it! After a round of thanks and handshakes, {0.SimFirstName} is sent on {M0.his}{F0.her} way, none the richer for {M0.his}{F0.her} time.
Yes! {0.SimFirstName} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} system rebuilt just in time for the tournament. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fingers fly through the mouse- and key-clicks with deadly accuracy, earning {0.SimPronounObjective} thousands of Simoleons in prize money and a streaming video deal.
At first no one answers, until the new intern shifts to let {0.SimFirstName} see his screen. It’s a doctored-up photo all right, but the ax-wielding mutant isn’t {0.SimFirstName}. It’s {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, which is easy enough to laugh off.
Whoops! Who knew blackwater fever is actually a complication of malaria? Apparently, the company {0.SimFirstName} was supposed to be speaking for does. After all, it’s a media company, packed with journalists who live to sniff out lies. {0.SimFirstName} takes a beating online, but at least {M0.he}{F0.she} can let it blow over while {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} on {M0.his}{F0.her} retreat.
Blissfully ignoring all incoming emails, {0.SimFirstName} manages to get a lot of work done. Unfortunately, none of it was the high priority work that the production team was trying to assign to {M0.him}{F0.her}. Now the team will have to scramble to pull an important demo together!
{0.SimFirstName} has done {M0.his}{F0.her} homework and it shows! Surprised but pleased at the attention, the partner sets down his phone and begins to question {0.SimFirstName}, giving {0.SimFirstName} ample opportunity to demonstrate {M0.his}{F0.her} thinking and secure some seed funding.
Looks like the old flame is still full of fire. By the time {0.SimFirstName}’s manager picks up the chat, he gets a blazing tirade, which he kindly passes on to {0.SimFirstName}. It is easily the worst service call of {M0.his}{F0.her} career.
Fat chance finding anyone in this gamers’ paradise. By the time {0.SimFirstName} elbows {M0.his}{F0.her} way past the warrior queens, zombies, and plumbers, {M0.his}{F0.her} shift is already over and {M0.his}{F0.her} boss is furious.
The media company is angry about the cancellation-{0.SimFirstName}’s picture is all over their marketing-but hey, blackwater fever is no joke. {0.SimFirstName} pulls off the lie, and is smart enough to lay low until {M0.his}{F0.her} suntan fades.
Well, the table isn’t a problem anymore, but {0.SimFirstName} didn’t avoid confronting {M0.his}{F0.her} team. Forced to explain why {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t just say something, {M0.he}{F0.she} loses the loyalty of key employees, who head for greener pastures.
{0.SimFirstName} should have done a little research before vouching for {M0.his}{F0.her} colleague. When the ugly truth is dragged into the light, {0.SimFirstName} is accused of colluding and {M0.his}{F0.her} company’s stock plummets.
WAR MEADOW 6 is totally amazing, a huge jump forward from the 5th one that came out four months ago. And {0.SimFirstName} should have plenty of time to check it out, since {M0.his}{F0.her} boss will never let {0.SimPronounObjective} demo a game again!
Great managers know when to stay above the riff-raff. Whatever the joke was, it passes, and {0.SimFirstName} is happy to see more camaraderie on {M0.his}{F0.her} team.
{0.SimFirstName} manages to make a joke of the whole thing, charming the audience and moderator with {M0.his}{F0.her} humor and charisma. The moderator gives {0.SimPronounObjective} extra opportunities to show off {M0.his}{F0.her} expertise, gaining {0.SimPronounObjective} valuable contacts at the event.
{0.SimFirstName} has either overestimated {M0.his}{F0.her} skills or underestimated the project. Sure, nobody else in this cubicle pit could do better, but when deadlines slip and bugs appear, everyone looks {0.SimFirstName}’s way.
Lucky for {0.SimFirstName}, the relationship wasn’t as memorable as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought—or at least, the flame doesn’t acknowledge {M0.his}{F0.her} name or chat picture. {0.SimFirstName} meets this customer’s service needs, and avoids an awkward confrontation.
Without the interference, {0.SimFirstName} is able to clear everything off {M0.his}{F0.her} plate in record time. Not bad! Now {M0.he}{F0.she} should be able to take some time and get to the root of the producer’s problems.
Success! {0.SimFirstName} presents the game up the chain without the CEO’s changes. Everyone loves it-except the CEO-but by now it has so much momentum that he green lights it as is.
Hang Tight
Phew! A press release reveals that the competitor’s product isn’t even targeted at the same market and has a radically different feature set than {0.SimFirstName}’s. Succeed or fail, it won’t have an impact on {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
{0.SimFirstName} strains to drown out the noise and becomes hyper-focused on the game. {M0.He}{F0.She} sees and hears nothing except his enemies evaporating in {M0.his}{F0.her} crosshairs. {0.SimFirstName} wins the round by a wide margin, and Furball and his friends go wild!
The problem with attacking popular people is that they’re really, really popular. The sponsor drops {0.SimFirstName} like a hot coal, but at least no one can blame {M0.him}{F0.her} when the team gets destroyed in the first round.
Patience never was a virtue of this particular ex, so {0.SimFirstName} is rid of the problem quickly. {M0.He}{F0.She} can now spend {M0.his}{F0.her} time on more important pursuits, like completely disguising {M0.his}{F0.her} profile picture.
The sponsor suggests a practice round with software to track APM. Luckily, the numbers prove {0.SimFirstName} right, and the weak link is dropped before any real damage is done.
Whoops. A press release reveals that the competitor’s product is not only targeted at the same market segment, but it has a radically larger feature set than {0.SimFirstName}’s. Furious that {0.SimFirstName} didn’t see it coming, management kills {M0.his}{F0.her} project.
{0.SimFirstName} hasn’t made it this far for nothing. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} played tired before, and {M0.he}{F0.she} can certainly do it now. Three deep breaths, and {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} in the zone…and crushing it.
Just as {0.SimFirstName} predicted, the self-promoting superstar makes a pitiful showing. Unfortunately, the sponsor doesn’t know enough about gaming to see who the weak link is. Everyone is dropped and the team is disbanded. And Mr. Superstar will probably have another deal lined up by tomorrow...
LAN party foul! A grown adult sweating in a fur suit for the entertainment of a few hundred gamers is sad enough, but getting dressed down by {0.SimFirstName} is just pathetic. The crowd quickly takes the Furball’s side and now {0.SimFirstName} has to contend with raucous jeers!
Welp, that’s enough from THAT 9-year-old! {0.SimFirstName} boots him, and even though the squad has to play the next match a man down, without the distracting child to deal with, they coordinate and dominate.
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} makes it to the booth, and just in time for {M0.his}{F0.her} shift! Seeing gamers play the game for the first time is a blast, the event is a huge success, and there’s still plenty of time to hit the show floor!
It takes time, and {0.SimFirstName} has to set all of {M0.his}{F0.her} other work aside, but {M0.he}{F0.she} finally manages to give the producer what he needed. In the next team meeting, the grateful producer calls {0.SimFirstName} out for going above and beyond.
Ahh. That smells better, though it would take at least 3 more bottles to really rid the place of the offending odor.  Foul Boy is, of course, the only tester in the pit to complain about the {M0.men’s body spray}{F0.air freshener} smell.
The moderator seems to take it in stride, but a few minutes into the panel, it’s clear she has it out for {0.SimFirstName}. After humiliating {M0.him}{F0.her} in front of the audience and the mirthful press, she makes sure {0.SimFirstName}’s name is correct in the resulting coverage.
Ah, the joys of technology. It isn’t as easy to coordinate tactics when one of your squadmates is silent, but it’s far less distracting this way. Besides, this smart-mouthed 9-year-old has to go to bed sometime, right?
{0.SimFirstName} can’t risk permanent damage to {M0.his}{F0.her} system with a rush repair job. {0.SimFirstName} plays the tourney on a machine {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} never used before. The results aren’t pretty.
Apparently, all those energy drinks have Foul Boy a bit tense. He storms out, swearing that {0.SimFirstName} sucks, the job sucks, {0.SimFirstName} sucks, life sucks, and did he mention that everyone on the whole QA team sucks? But it does smell better now.
At the official pitch meeting, {0.SimFirstName} can’t seem to present a single concept without the CEO challenging {M0.him}{F0.her}. The other execs, sensing the negative energy, kill the project before it even gets a chance.
Nothing is wrong with the company books, and reporters soon discover that the CFO’s jilted ex is responsible for the entire mess. Nobody blames {0.SimFirstName} for investigating, except maybe the CFO, but he has bigger problems to worry about at the moment.
Well, it isn’t {0.SimFirstName}’s best performance by a long shot, but then nobody’s on their game…except the new girl {0.SimFirstName} has been smack-talking with the most. She destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And then the press destroys {M0.him}{F0.her} some more.
Oh dear, Foul Boy has a foul mouth, and {0.SimFirstName} is getting the brunt of it. While Foul Boy unleashes a tirade against {M0.him}{F0.her}, the other testers take advantage and log several bugs that {0.SimFirstName} could have discovered.
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t sure whether {M0.he}{F0.she} comes off as gracious or spineless, but {M0.he}{F0.she} makes a much better impression than the moderator, who proceeds to flub her way through the session. The panel is completely ignored by the press, which is probably best for everyone.
Upper management panics and decides to rush {0.SimFirstName}’s product to market, bugs and all. This can only lead to poor reviews and disappointing sales. Meanwhile the competitor gets to glide to success as the “improved” product. Infuriating!
Way to dig in and get the job done, {0.SimFirstName}! Sure, it might take some longer days (or weeks) to get up to speed, but {M0.his}{F0.her} manager praises {M0.his}{F0.her} initiative, even if she offers no OT.
This time, work comes first! {0.SimFirstName} delivers a thought-provoking keynote that generates great press for {M0.his}{F0.her} company, and then makes up for the lost vacation day with a few indulgent after-parties.
{0.SimFirstName} emails the concept to a few other studios, but no one bites. And now {M0.his}{F0.her} own studio has moved on to a new idea. {0.SimFirstName}’s game has joined countless other great concepts in limbo.
{0.SimFirstName} is a popular Sim, and {M0.his}{F0.her} employees respect {M0.him}{F0.her} for being direct. The pool table is reserved for the weekly company happy hour and productivity goes up.
The great thing about being the {M0.King}{F0.Queen} is practicing on all the free mice and keyboards corporations send you. While the replacements aren’t {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite brand, {0.SimFirstName} is familiar with them and quickly gets a feel for the new controls. Victory is imminent!
{0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not the only one who can’t take any more of this hateful 9-year-old’s outbursts, but it sure feels like it when {M0.his}{F0.her} squad realizes they have to play the next match a man down. They rebel and refuse to coordinate. The match is a disaster.
Phew! Reporters soon discover that the CFO’s jilted ex is responsible for the entire mess. Reassured by the solidarity within the leadership team, shareholders invest more and the company’s stock recovers.
Embarrassed and angry at being called out, the partner answers {0.SimFirstName}’s question rudely and begins to attack {M0.his}{F0.her} plan. {0.SimFirstName} tries to recover, but when the partner claims to have another meeting, {M0.he}{F0.she} is met with the door.
Nobody seems to hear {0.SimFirstName}, becoming suddenly very focused on work. Too nervous to take it any further, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets it go, losing even more face and drawing more snickers.
Well, that didn’t go well. An employee points out that they’re all working for shares, and could be making bank elsewhere. They obviously have faith in the company; it’s {0.SimFirstName} who needs to believe in them. More people chime in, then pack up and walk out.
{0.SimFirstName} feels a bit sheepish for leaving early, but embarrassing {M0.himself}{F0.herself} in front of a few fellow pros isn’t nearly so bad as doing it for the press. Luckily everyone is too distracted to notice when {M0.he}{F0.she} exits stage right.
Kudos to {0.SimFirstName} for having the guts to ask for help! Unfortunately, nobody here has the first idea of how to do it, either, especially {M0.his}{F0.her} manager. And she would rather see {0.SimFirstName} sink than her.

{0.SimFirstName} announces an Ancient Art mixer. People can dress in togas and olive branches! Before {M0.he}{F0.she} knows it dozens of people have signed up for the event. This looks good!

{0.SimFirstName} rallies other artists, and before too long, everyone is fired up to move post-post-post-retro-cubist-fauv-modern-eccentricism forward. How long until it evolves another &quot;post?&quot;
