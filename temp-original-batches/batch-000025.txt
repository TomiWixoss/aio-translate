Handiness Skill
Broken objects can be repaired with a little time and effort. While repairing, Sims improve their Handiness Skill.
Sims in the Focused Emotion will generally be better at Handiness interactions.
As Sims improve their Handiness Skill, they'll be able to upgrade their household items. Upgraded items have new benefits. For example, they can be unbreakable!
Sims need to spend upgrade parts to upgrade items. Upgrade parts can be found in piles of salvage next to repaired items or can be purchased through the computer.
