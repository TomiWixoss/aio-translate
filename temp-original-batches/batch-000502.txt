{0.SimFirstName} has been training for this moment {M0.his}{F0.her} entire career. An extra smidge of espresso, slightly thicker foam and then the masterpiece—not just a milky pattern, but a towering 3D foam crocus! Delighted, the boss sips it…and loves it! {0.SimFirstName} is going places now…
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. {0.SimFirstName} brews up a fresh pot, labeling it “Midnight Magic” and slapping an Organic! sticker on the sign. Customer after customer orders a cup, only to dump it out and demand a different refill. When {M0.his}{F0.her} manager comes back from break, he tastes it, dumps the pot and asks for Java Lamp.
{0.SimFirstName} has been training for this moment {M0.his}{F0.her} entire career. An extra smidge of espresso, slightly thicker foam and then the masterpiece—not just a pattern, but a towering 3D foam crocus…that flops onto the boss’ §600 tie. Maybe {0.SimFirstName} has a little more training to do after all…
Scrub It Clean
Throw It Out
End of Day Cleaning
{0.SimFirstName} is just about to hang up {M0.his}{F0.her} spiffy white apron when {M0.his}{F0.her} manager nods toward the sink. There’s an old steel carafe that’s been rotting there since the Dark Ages. Inside, burnt moldy coffee laps gray, gluey froth. Cleaning it will take forever (and be unspeakably gross). Tossing it out, however… 
New Beans
{0.SimFirstName} is contentedly grinding {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite blends—Java Lamp and Captain John’s Cleanse—when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a new variety of bean in the shipment. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes a whiff, noting the caramel overtones and approachable aroma beneath. There’s no label. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} brew a batch, or try mixing it with something else?
Career Opportunity
Whoa. The corporate boss has just arrived at {0.SimFirstName}’s café and is ordering a latte. He’s distracted, frowning and listening to the manager, hardly glancing at {0.SimFirstName} while placing his order. Of course, {0.SimFirstName} could make sure he notices. Serve him something extra special. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could play it safe and make a regular old latte.

Ellie is furious at getting the Time Out and screams that they’re for babies. Dropping the paint, she starts throwing toys, stuffed animals, books. {0.SimFirstName} will be lucky to get her calm, clean and into her pj’s before her parents get back, not to mention tackling this terrible mess…  
{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath and tries reasoning with the child-turned-dervish. Ellie drops the paint, glares wickedly and starts throwing toys, stuffed animals, books. At this rate {0.SimFirstName} will be lucky to get her calm, clean and into her pj’s before her parents get back. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s already decided they can deal with the mess… 
{0.SimFirstName} explains that {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t like this game, and asks Ellie to tell {M0.him}{F0.her} when she’s done so they can clean up. {M0.He}{F0.She} steps outside. A second later, Ellie comes out, eyes down, lip out. They wash the walls. A hot bath and a few books later, she’s contentedly dreaming in her bed.
Now that {0.SimFirstName} has explained it, the girls have agreed that taking turns is fair. The only problem is who goes first. “My turn,” one shouts. “No, MINE.” The bigger girl yanks the doll so hard the head pops right off the body. “It’s dead. You killed it!” they wail. {0.SimFirstName}’s supervisor comes running.
{0.SimFirstName} takes the doll away until the girls agree to share. One girl shoves the other. “See what you did? It was mine.” During the ensuing shoving match, the bigger girl yanks the doll back so hard its head pops off. “It’s dead! You killed it!” they wail at {0.SimFirstName}. {M0.His}{F0.Her} supervisor comes running.
Ellie is furious about the Time Out, but it works. After a few minutes of pouting, she helps {0.SimFirstName} wash off the walls. A hot bath and a few books later, she’s contentedly dreaming in her bed. Luckily, her parents are more embarrassed than angry, and very relieved that {0.SimFirstName}’s willing to come again.
Wow. Charlie has a serious set of lungs for a 4-year-old. {0.SimFirstName} practically has to force feed him the green glop, with the boy eyeing his cookie prize the entire time. Three tantrums, one dinner, and one cookie later, he finally goes to bed, grumbling about “the worst sitter in the world.”
{0.SimFirstName} takes the doll away and explains that neither girl gets it if they can’t share. Tears well in both girls’ eyes, and then one shoves the other. “See what you did? It was mine.” “No, mine.” “MINE.” {0.SimFirstName} quickly interrupts the shoving match with Music Time! Three verses into Old MacDonald, and all is happily forgotten. Nice!
{0.SimFirstName} looks at the green glop on the boy’s plate and sighs. If anyone deserves a cookie, it’s Charlie. {M0.He}{F0.She} hands over the cookie, but Charlie has to PROMISE to eat a full meal afterward. Charlie nods, swallows the cookie, and hardly touches his dinner. But he goes to bed happy!
This is going pretty well! Now that {0.SimFirstName} has explained it, the girls have agreed that taking turns is fair. The only problem is who goes first. {0.SimFirstName} chooses the meaner girl. “That’s life,” mutters the meek one. So many lessons being learned!

Sharing Lessons
{0.SimFirstName} is happily watching some children play Family when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears screaming from inside the playhouse. Two girls have hold of the same baby doll and are tugging and screaming at each other. {0.SimFirstName} knows this is a “teaching moment”—the perfect opportunity for a lesson about sharing. So, how do you teach that again?
Charlie's Dessert
{0.SimFirstName} is babysitting for a new family, dolloping Quinoa and Kale Delight (“Charlie’s favorite!”) onto a dinner plate and sweetly ignoring the crashing sounds from the boy’s bedroom when suddenly it’s quiet. {M0.His}{F0.Her} heart skips. Then a small voice asks, “Can I have a cookie?” Charlie is not supposed to have ANY cookies until after dinner.
Painting the Walls
{0.SimFirstName} goes to get little Ellie ready for bed. {M0.He}{F0.She} calls. No answer. Opens her door. Oh no. Red, blue and a mysterious brown over every wall. On her face, in her hair, flying from her fingers. {0.SimFirstName} begs her to stop but she just screams, “NO!!” {0.SimFirstName} isn’t supposed to give Time Outs, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has to do something…
{0.SimFirstName}’s team brings home some fine data points, but was the mission really worth the expense? The agency honchos are considering scrapping worthless little missions like this, which aren’t worth anyone’s time. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s paid to clean, not question authority. But after the second time the shuttle comes back with strange damage and markings, the bosses start to notice. Turns out the astronauts have been taking the shuttle on joyrides, and {0.SimFirstName} could have put a stop to it if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} spoken up earlier.
Although {0.SimFirstName} tries to steer carefully, an asteroid crashes into the side of the ship. Not only is the paint job ruined, but there might be a huge hole, too. {M0.He}{F0.She} has to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} mission short and return to base early. 
{0.SimFirstName} searches for the origin of the sound…and eventually discovers that it’s nothing but an old, busted radio in an abandoned spacecraft. {M0.He}{F0.She} wasted a ton of time and fuel for nothing. 
With a full night’s sleep, {0.SimFirstName} can employ expert-level test-taking strategies and do some critical thinking. {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to pass the test with a fairly decent grade, despite not actually knowing anything.
The senior officer gets furious when {0.SimFirstName} refuses to obey his command, but in a few seconds it’s clear that the situation is under control. It was just a light bulb out, not a fuel emergency. The senior officer praises {0.SimFirstName} for cool thinking in a crisis.
Outside the venue, some fans get a little grabby with the singer, but that’s not {0.SimFirstName}’s problem.  A few citizens praise {M0.him}{F0.her} for refusing to subsidize celebrities with public resources.
“Stop asking so many questions,” says {0.SimFirstName}’s boss. Where the shuttle went and who was on it and what stars they may or may not have blown up are of no concern of {0.SimFirstName}’s.
{0.SimFirstName} straps {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into the pod and blasts off, headed straight for terra firma. As {M0.he}{F0.she} looks into the rearview mirror, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the ship explode! {M0.He}{F0.She} got out just in time. 
{0.SimFirstName} leaves the suspect handcuffed at a Space Gas station, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back from the hijacking scene all that’s left are the cuffs and the lingering smell of gas and failure. The guy’s long gone, and {0.SimFirstName} has lots of paperwork to do to explain why.
Money is nice, but so is sleeping soundly at night. {0.SimFirstName} isn’t scared of getting {M0.his}{F0.her} hands a little dirty, but this space gangster is legitimately a maniac. It isn’t worth it. {0.SimFirstName} passes on the job.
It's not a popular move, but it's good business! {0.SimFirstName} makes a killing on the skins, which gives {M0.him}{F0.her} a little room to invest in some even more exotic inventory.
Customers respect that {0.SimFirstName} didn't cheat them. Even once the current craze for Snyxskin is over, they'll keep coming back to {0.SimFirstName} for all their exotic goods needs.
{M0.He}{F0.She} installs the system once it’s approved, but the pilots love it so much that they’re angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for not doing it sooner! Just can’t win for losing in this place. 
It takes much of {M0.his}{F0.her} potable water and {M0.his}{F0.her} best space pillow, but {0.SimFirstName} manages to smother the fire. Mission control praises {0.SimPronounObjective} for keeping {M0.his}{F0.her} cool, and rewards {0.SimPronounObjective} with the location of a secret stash of Astronaut Food Stix on board the ship. The mission continues.
A few miscreants protest, but soon the galactic citizens are shaping up. The cleanup campaign’s even got its own adorable advertising mascot: Smoot the Scolding Cephalopoid.

Orbiting the moon has proven a prudent, if boring choice! {0.SimFirstName} will surely join the annals of other Sims who've seen the moon from a closer distance; yes, those nearly brave heroes whose names no one can remember will surely be remembered forevermore.
This has been a terrifying ordeal of deception and malevolence, and {0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn't even WANT to know who's been following {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} heads home as fast as the ship will go.
It was an act of sheer optimism for {0.SimFirstName} to believe {M0.he}{F0.she} could decipher the workings of an alien spacecraft. {M0.He}{F0.She} isn’t very handy with machines anyway. The sun is starting to set and it won’t be safe to stay out any longer. {0.SimFirstName} will have to abandon the search and hope for the best on the flight home.
Approching the crew, it becomes obvious from the look in their eyes that they have contracted space madness! Immediately, the astronauts begins pelting {0.SimFirstName} with food, forcing {M0.him}{F0.her} to flee back to the rocket. {0.SimFirstName} sends a message to command. Hopefully, they know what to do.
{0.SimFirstName} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} pod to go investigate, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets out there {M0.he}{F0.she} can't remember what {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to be doing. As it turns out, one of the symptoms of Space Madness is short-term memory loss. Bored, {0.SimFirstName} simply goes home.
With {0.SimFirstName}’s help, Hiattooine's food replicators begin launching non-grilled cheese—at hyperspeed! The Rebel forces are soon buried in disgusting sandwiches. {0.SimFirstName} is arrested along with them, and is forced to hand over the landing stabilizers on the rocket to secure {M0.his}{F0.her} release.
The only thing {0.SimFirstName} catches from the muck is a swamp-borne disease. The trial is over, and the creature will not help {M0.him}{F0.her}. The only option now is to fire up the engines and go for full burn to clear the swamp. There’s no telling what damage that could do to the ship, though....
{0.SimFirstName} cautiously inspects the hat with an outstretched arm.  Who knows; it could have space-lice!  Murmurs through the crowd indicate that something is amiss.  They think {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t know how a hat works!  Before a rapid donning can ameliorate the confusion, {0.SimFirstName} is zapped back onto {F0.her}{M0.his} spaceship, which is already cruising towards home.
Bad things happen when a person consumes 17 packages of astronaut mashed potatoes. But wait - {0.SimFirstName}'s slowly starting to feel sharper, more clear-headed…why did {M0.he}{F0.she} do so many weird things? {M0.He}{F0.She} must have had Space Madness! In case it comes back, {0.SimFirstName} heads for home immediately.
As {0.SimFirstName} cruises deeper into space, the pressure differential causes a warping of {M0.his}{F0.her} brain's equilibrium centers. In short, {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness is cured! By science! {M0.He}{F0.She} realizes how bizarre {0.SimFirstName} been acting and flags a passing ship for help returning home.
{0.SimFirstName} opens the fuel valve and watches all {M0.his}{F0.her} propellant trickle out. Soon, the engines sputter and die. Now {M0.he's}{F0.she's} floating through deep space with no way to get home. The rocket automatically activates its distress beacon. Hopefully a friendly ship will stop by and give {0.SimFirstName} a tow…and some fresh oxygen.
{0.SimFirstName} really has been meaning to polish up on {M0.his}{F0.her} social skills. The little creature takes great offense to {0.SimFirstName}’s pleas. Suddenly, all of the creatures in the camp begin to hiss. They draw tiny but vicious-looking blades. This planet isn’t safe anymore. It’s not ideal, but {0.SimFirstName} will have to attempt the flight home without a new catalyzer!
Wrong! The panel shuts down and the door won't open. {0.SimFirstName} has no choice but to drift aimlessly and hope a passing ship tows {M0.him}{F0.her} back home…
Why slow down now? {0.SimFirstName} accelerates past the red—but without thrusters {M0.his}{F0.her} engine bursts into flames. The cops tow {0.SimPronounObjective} back to the station, where they charge {0.SimPronounObjective} for alien-napping and endangering a minor. Hopefully {0.SimFirstName} can escape and make it back home from here…
{0.SimFirstName}'s oxygen is down to fumes when a trader ship passes by and detects the signal from the beacon. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} saved! The ship's alien cook makes {M0.him}{F0.her} something like a grilled cheese while the ship's mechanic fixes the hull breach with his terrible foreclaws. Looks like {0.SimFirstName} lives to explore another day!
{0.SimFirstName} fires an ion blast at the creature’s stash of rocks—and misses! Grinning from ear to pointy green ear, the alien chortles, catches an asteroid in the phase beam and hurls it at {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, cracking a tail panel. He’s reaching for another as {0.SimFirstName} blasts away at top speed. Hopefully, the ship can still land…
The pain spirits will be forestalled by the spastic gyrations of the dance, or so {0.SimFirstName} thinks. Through sheer luck {M0.his}{F0.her} random flailing actually activates the ship's emergency beacon. A rescue crew soon shows up to tow {0.SimFirstName} back into {M0.his}{F0.her} home orbit.
{0.SimFirstName} drops everything and runs! Dozens of spider-like aliens descend on {0.SimPronounObjective} and carry {0.SimPronounObjective}, roughly, back to the ship. An alien technician climbs aboard and programs something. {0.SimFirstName} finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} rocketing toward home, hoping {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel will somehow last...
&quot;No worries, dude,&quot; says the alien. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes, but promises to help out next time. As {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts off for home, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the alien forlornly playing his didgeridoo as he fades into the distance. {0.SimFirstName} might want to consider getting that expanded cargo bay.
{0.SimFirstName} runs to the ship, but the pain in {M0.his}{F0.her} side is unbearable. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s not fast enough. As the rocket door opens, a nightmare in black fur pounces on {0.SimPronounObjective}! It’s all teeth and claws until {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to scramble into the ship. The wounds can be dressed, but {0.SimFirstName} will have to fly home without the catalyzer.
Ignoring the computer, {0.SimFirstName} manages to manually connect the dynotherms. {M0.He}{F0.She} always was good with machines! The error message clears. Now {0.SimFirstName} should be able to pilot the ship back home safely.
Unfortunately, the police captain's no idiot. When {0.SimFirstName} turns on the charm, that only makes the officer more suspicious. The police find and confiscate the contraband, giving {0.SimFirstName} a stern warning to keep away from alien riff-raff. Relieved and refueled, {0.SimFirstName} blasts off for home.
Diplomacy first, {0.SimFirstName} always says, but this time it ain’t happening. The instant {M0.he}{F0.she} lands on the yellow moon, {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship is surrounded by a mob of angry-looking colonists. They rock &quot;the government {M0.man's}{F0.woman's}&quot; rocket back and forth until it falls over, and race to their fighter ships. {0.SimFirstName} hopes {M0.he}{F0.she} can still get home safely.
Though {0.SimFirstName} pushes really, REALLY hard, the triangular hole fails to accept the ball. Jeers erupt from the crowd, as the spectating beings exchange both sideways glances and lost wagers. Abruptly, {0.SimFirstName} is zapped back onto {M0.his}{F0.her} spaceship, already cruising towards home.
