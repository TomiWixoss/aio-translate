Test Day
{0.SimFirstName} has two different tests today, and one of them is going to be tough. There’s a little time to study beforehand. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} spend all of {M0.his}{F0.her} time studying for the harder test, or use the time to study for both tests equally?
Study Group
{0.SimFirstName} is struggling in a couple of subjects. There’s a study group that meets every day during free period. {0.SimFirstName} can either go and get some tutoring, or blow it off and assume {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} doing well enough to pass. 
Counter Bullying Stratagem
Now that {0.SimFirstName} gets pretty good grades, some bullies have been picking on {M0.him}{F0.her} lately. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} confront them with a witty comeback, or ignore them and hope they’ll pick a different target? 
Bathroom Cash
While taking a quick break, {0.SimFirstName} spies some money just sitting on a sink in the bathroom. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} slide it in {M0.his}{F0.her} locker for safekeeping, or just turn it in to the principal right away?
Aid a Friend
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend hasn’t studied for the big exam today. Since {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} taking it earlier in the day, {0.SimFirstName} could easily remember the questions and slip {M0.his}{F0.her} friend the answers. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do it, or just let the friend figure it out? 
Language Exam
Taking a language exam, {0.SimFirstName} is stumped by one of the questions. What’s the correct pronoun case preceding a gerund? Maybe {0.SimFirstName}'s neighbor knows—should {0.SimFirstName} take a peek at the other student’s test paper, or try to work it out on {M0.his}{F0.her} own? 
Grade Boost
A big unit test is coming up in history class. {0.SimFirstName}'s been doing okay, but a good score would really boost {M0.his}{F0.her} overall grade. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do {M0.his}{F0.her} usual amount of studying, or study as much as {M0.he}{F0.she} can? 
Class Presentation
{0.SimFirstName} has to present in front of the entire class! {M0.He}{F0.She} has some great ideas for how to jazz up {M0.his}{F0.her} presentation, even if they’re not exactly what the teacher asked for. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} go all-out and make {M0.his}{F0.her} presentation shine, or just do what was asked? 
{1.String} School Party
All week at school, kids had been asking their sweethearts to the annual {1.String} School Party. There will be cookies and punch, music, the exchanging of flowers and cards, and of course, awkward chaperones! {0.SimFirstName} had yet to be asked, so {M0.he}{F0.she} had two options…
Decorating for the {1.String} Dance
When the teacher asked for volunteers to help setup for the {1.String} dance, {0.SimFirstName} was quick to raise {M0.his}{F0.her} hand! Not only would {M0.he}{F0.she} get out of class for a few hours, but {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} be given a unique opportunity.
Outdoor Studying
The teacher announces some outdoor study time to get the kids out of the classroom for a while. Should {0.SimFirstName} take {M0.his}{F0.her} studying outside, or just go hang outside with {M0.his}{F0.her} friends until it’s time to go back in?
Extra Credit
{0.SimFirstName}'s teacher approaches {0.SimPronounObjective} in class with an offer: Stay through lunch to do some extra assignments and maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can bump up {M0.his}{F0.her} grade a bit. Should {0.SimFirstName} bother with the extra credit, or just blow it off? 
Group Project
{0.SimFirstName}'s latest classroom assignment is a group project. {M0.His}{F0.Her} groupmates are all pretty smart—should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to contribute as much as they do, or just let them do the work? 
Movie Day
The best day in any class is always movie day! The science teacher decided to show a movie instead of teach—should {0.SimFirstName} pay attention, or just take a nap? 
Rival's Notebook
While leaving the bathroom, {0.SimFirstName} notices that {M0.his}{F0.her} chief academic rival has left {M0.his}{F0.her} notebook sitting on the sink. It’s got notes, homework, and lots of other important information inside…should {0.SimFirstName} return it to its owner, or just toss it in the trash? 
SDT Scores
{0.SimFirstName} just got the results from {M0.his}{F0.her} SDT (Success Determination Test). {M0.His}{F0.Her} scores aren’t quite as high as {M0.he}{F0.she} hoped they would be. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} sign up to re-take the test, or just be happy with what {M0.he}{F0.she} has?
Maintaining Consciousness
Ugh, another boring day in boring class. {0.SimFirstName}'s got to find a way to keep {M0.himself}{F0.herself} awake—should {M0.he}{F0.she} shoot some spitballs at {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, or really try to focus on paying attention?
Cram Night
{0.SimFirstName} has an extremely important test coming up, but school has been so busy lately... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} drink a ton of cola and cram right up to the test, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} find some light activity to do and give {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a little rest?
Make {1.String} Flower Cards
During Art, {0.SimFirstName}’s class was instructed to create flower-themed cards for each other. After gathering glitter, colored pencils, construction paper petals, and fuzzy pipecleaners, {0.SimFirstName} sat down—{M0.his}{F0.her} creative juices flowing. The cards would be shared and opened with the rest of the class during the party later, so this had to be good! Two themes came to mind…
Running the Class
The teacher has to step out for a second to talk to a parent. She asks {0.SimFirstName} to run the class for a little while—should {0.SimFirstName} keep following the lesson plan the teacher laid out, or do something fun and easy with {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates?
Due Date
{0.SimFirstName} suddenly realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t have that big assignment that’s due today! {M0.He}{F0.She} could just go to class and take a huge zero, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could get out of class... by pulling the fire alarm. 
Counselor's Office
{0.SimFirstName} is sent to the guidance counselor’s office to discuss ways to “improve {M0.his}{F0.her} academic experience.” The counselor’s asking all sorts of questions…should {0.SimFirstName} tell the truth, or just make something up that will leave the counselor satisfied?
Standardized Test
Big standardized test today. {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t feel fully prepared... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} actually try to guess the answers correctly, or just see what happens when {M0.he}{F0.she} fills in all C’s on the form? 
Average Out
{0.SimFirstName}’s last math test was not {M0.his}{F0.her} best work. {M0.He}{F0.She} got a so-so grade, which could really bring down {M0.his}{F0.her} average. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} ask to do some extra credit, or just try hard to get a perfect grade next time?
School Project
Students are allowed to choose their own assignment for an upcoming school project. Should {0.SimFirstName} choose an easy assignment and ensure a good grade, or find a more challenging assignment and learn something new?
