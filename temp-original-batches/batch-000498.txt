{0.SimFirstName} wins fair and square, because hard work and perseverance always beat underhanded techniques! Yeah, {0.SimFirstName}’s surprised, too.
The assembled Supreme Villains nod and applaud politely. Is it time to eat yet?
{0.SimFirstName} manages to switch off the phone without being discovered, but the moment is ruined. The informant gives up some intel, but not what {0.SimFirstName} really wanted.
All it takes is a stealthy kick in the shin for the rival agent to go down. {0.SimFirstName} wins the sack race and the admiration of all. 
The buzzing goes away almost as fast as it appeared. Things seem to be normal, so {0.SimFirstName}’s pretty sure everything’s fine for now.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to trip {M0.his}{F0.her} rival, but the rival’s quicker than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought—{0.SimFirstName} whiffs and ends up on {M0.his}{F0.her} back. {M0.He}{F0.She} loses the race and looks like a fool.
The important take away here is that sometimes cheating totally works. {0.SimFirstName} loses, and no one sees that {M0.his}{F0.her} rival was cheating. Hooray! Another moral victory for {0.SimName}!
{0.SimFirstName} manages to hold out for a few minutes until reinforcements show up. Just in time, too—{0.SimFirstName} was running out of fingernails to have things shoved under.
When they hear that {0.SimFirstName} works for Good, the henchmen relax a bit. Turns out they’re undercover, too. The three trade stories about the best places to hide an audio wire.
{0.SimFirstName} knows these guys really just want a friend. After only a few minutes the suspect gives up his boss, his boss’s boss, and everyone else he’s ever worked for.
The other researcher does a stellar job, and {0.SimFirstName} promises to cover for him when he's in a pinch. {0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are pleased. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s mentor explains how he’s just been having trouble at home, and everything goes back to normal—until the mentor goes rogue during a mission and publicly announces his alliance change! If {0.SimFirstName} had told someone sooner, maybe they could have stopped him from flipping. 
Oh, right! National security! A lot of those secrets are not {0.SimFirstName}’s to give away. The deal with the publisher is canceled, and {0.SimFirstName} is sharply reprimanded by {M0.his}{F0.her} bosses. 
The villain brings backup, and only someone with a temper problem and lack of respect for authority could handle it. {0.SimFirstName}’s hothead agent makes some split-second decisions that save everyone’s lives.
Before {M0.he}{F0.she} can swallow, the guards rush over and pry it out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. Really? Eating the evidence? The guards seem to show more pity than anger.
{0.SimFirstName}’s handlers know that {M0.his}{F0.her} integrity is above suspicion. {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} never turn traitor just for a few lousy Simoleons. It’d have to be an absolute TON of Simoleons. 
A criminal from the agency’s most-wanted list strolls onto the scene—with the item. {0.SimFirstName} tries to tackle him, but he gets away.
On his way out the door, the informant snatches up two weapons prototypes and {0.SimFirstName}’s lunch from the fridge. Sayonara, suckers!
{0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are satisfied with {M0.his}{F0.her} findings. When you’re a spy, you start to get suspicious of everyone, after all. {M0.His}{F0.Her} trust within the agency has never been higher. 
{0.SimFirstName}’s outfit is so average, so unremarkable, that {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes a virtual ghost. Nobody notices {0.SimPronounObjective} as {M0.he}{F0.she} goes about {M0.his}{F0.her} spy business and the mission proceeds like clockwork.
Thanks to a hidden pocket in a very private place on {M0.his}{F0.her} body, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} able to successfully conceal the document as {M0.he}{F0.she} makes {M0.his}{F0.her} escape, jumping out a window and landing in some bushes. 
Who comes home and goes directly to the attic?! The suspect, apparently. {0.SimFirstName}’s team is caught red-handed and the case is blown. 
Lobro is as kind and magnanimous as he is evil and power-hungry. He signs an autograph, takes a selfie, and promises to call {0.SimFirstName} if he ever has an opening for a nemesis. 
{0.SimFirstName} was able to catch a suspect, but {M0.his}{F0.her} superiors are not convinced {0.SimFirstName} has the evidence to put the perp away! The last thing anyone wants is for the suspect to get off on a technicality and roam the world again.
The publisher sounds pretty excited to have the rights to {0.SimFirstName}’s story! There’s already talk of a major motion picture and tie-in video game. 
{0.SimFirstName} gets a call a little later. The dog got better, the grandma is overjoyed, and the informant will never squeal again. Even Supreme Villains get happy endings! 
{0.SimFirstName} shoves the paper into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth and hastily chews it down. It’s not the worst document {0.SimFirstName}'s ever eaten, but it’s not the best. The guards will never be able to figure out what {M0.he}{F0.she} took. 
{0.SimFirstName} shows the villains a prototype of {M0.his}{F0.her} Über Oscillation Vortex. The crowd goes wild! One audience member is so impressed, he spills his experimental age-reverse potion onto himself and immediately de-grows into an infant.
{0.SimFirstName} is a shadow agent, so {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} good at keeping secrets. {M0.He}{F0.She} finds the money and no one at HQ is ever the wiser. 
{0.SimFirstName} chooses the most likely candidate, who's dragged away protesting his innocence. &quot;Wow, who'd have thought?&quot; murmurs the big boss. {0.SimFirstName}'s secret is safe...for now.
The information on the disk is so valuable, it should never fall into the wrong hands. {0.SimFirstName}'s handler is glad that {M0.he}{F0.she} made the right call.
{0.SimFirstName} laughs {M0.his}{F0.her} best maniacal laughter and gleefully tells the informant that he’s headed for a tour of Prison Island, where inmates are hunted for sport before being forced to watch bad reality TV.
Being out on her own forced the young agent to learn to think quickly and rely on her wits. Now {0.SimFirstName} is regarded as a wise, skilled leader. 
Although {0.SimFirstName} tries desperately to make meaningful eye contact, {M0.he}{F0.she} clams up and lets Lobro pass by. {M0.He}{F0.She}’ll always wonder what might have been.
It turns out that the “reporter” was really an internal agency investigator. {0.SimFirstName} passed the loyalty test with flying colors, and it looks really good on {M0.his}{F0.her} file.
Seriously? Hardened criminals don’t just roll over because someone says “Please.” The suspect laughs in {0.SimFirstName}’s face and refuses to talk. 
The information the agent retrieved was so valuable, {0.SimFirstName}’s superiors don’t care that {M0.he}{F0.she} broke the rules.
At the last second {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} has no idea what to whisper, and winds up suggesting some pretty unsettling things. The informant leaves before revealing any intel.
{0.SimFirstName}'s Evil boss is starting to mistrust {M0.him}{F0.her}...another failure will look really bad.
{0.SimFirstName}’s partner will never know the truth, but they’ll never be able to work closely together either. The life of a spy is lonely and complicated, but it’s what {0.SimFirstName} signed up for.
Everyone loves a humble superspy! There’s not a dry eye in the house as {0.SimFirstName} tearfully dedicates {M0.his}{F0.her} award to the woman who taught {0.SimPronounObjective} how to break someone’s wrist just by touching their arm. 
{0.SimFirstName} successfully threatens, fist-wags, and spittle-flecks {M0.his}{F0.her} way to a confession. It’s not pretty, but this is how law enforcement is done. 
That package is probably halfway around the world by now. {0.SimFirstName} calls it in. HQ will try to track it, but no one expects to find it. 
While rifling through some boxes, {0.SimFirstName} hears sirens. The suspect heard noises downstairs and called the police. Now {0.SimFirstName}’s team has a LOT of explaining to do
The young agent is incompetent, and without {0.SimFirstName} there to hold it together, the whole mission would have been a disaster. The agency is grateful for {0.SimFirstName}’s dedication and hands-on style. 
Here it is! With the item in hand, {0.SimFirstName}’s team uses bedsheets to rappel down the side of the house and escape into the night. Good thing this guy keeps his bedsheets in the attic! 
The young agent barely knows her grenade pen from her actual pen, and the mission is nearly a disaster. Not that it's {0.SimFirstName}’s fault—{M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t want the agent on {M0.his}{F0.her} team in the first place. 
As the sun comes up, {0.SimFirstName} finally finishes the big report. But then {M0.he}{F0.she} crashes under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and misses the presentation meeting! The work is done, but missing the meeting doesn’t look good on {M0.his}{F0.her} record. 
Turns out that last year’s President of the Supreme Villains was killed by a rogue vortex, and the villains are not amused. They shame {0.SimFirstName} from the stage with a flurry of boos and lasers.
{0.SimFirstName} will take {M0.his}{F0.her} secrets to {M0.his}{F0.her} grave, if necessary, because that’s what Double Diamond Agents do. 
“For always inspiring me to work faster, punch harder, and decrypt codes more accurately, I thank you.” {0.SimFirstName} dedicating {M0.his}{F0.her} award to {M0.his}{F0.her} nemesis is regarded as gutsy and courageous. 
Senior agents can’t come running to the rescue every time. “You’ve got to start taking more initiative,” says {0.SimFirstName}’s boss. This isn’t going to look good on {M0.his}{F0.her} next performance review. 
“If you had failed, I was going to have you taken out,” {0.SimFirstName}’s Evil boss says, and then he enjoys a hearty laugh. It’s so nice to have a boss with a sense of humor again! 
Not all evildoing is exciting. Some isn’t even remotely interesting! Still, evil is evil, so {0.SimFirstName} cancels out the threat and all is well. 
The rules are there for a reason, {0.SimFirstName}...agents can't just make things up as they go. The hothead deviates from the plan and the whole mission is compromised. 
No op ever goes according to plan, and the bookworm just isn’t decisive enough. When things get real, the bookworm spends the whole time crying in the corner and {0.SimFirstName} looks terrible to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss.
{0.SimFirstName}'s skills must be a little rusty.... {M0.he}{F0.she} can't manage to locate the cache. If {M0.he}{F0.she} called in {M0.his}{F0.her} support team {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} have to share, so {M0.he}{F0.she} lets it go.
The creeps in IT love the pictures! The other agent wasn’t breaking any rules, so he doesn’t get in trouble, but he’s definitely embarrassed. {0.SimFirstName} even gets a new hard drive! 
The other researcher intentionally makes errors and leaves out information in order to make {0.SimFirstName} look bad. Now the other researcher is in line for a promotion and {0.SimFirstName}’s boss thinks {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} incompetent. 
Without {0.SimFirstName} in the office to manage {M0.his}{F0.her} caseload, all {M0.his}{F0.her} other cases fall apart. {M0.He}{F0.She} returns home to a mountain of paperwork. 
Suddenly, doors open, drinks are offered, and attractive strangers want to help. {0.SimFirstName} discovers that life’s just easier for the terminally hot. The mission’s completed in half the time and {0.SimFirstName} enjoys a little time off. 
Hey, what else is {M0.he}{F0.she} going to do with {M0.himself}{F0.herself}? {0.SimFirstName} doggedly keeps pursuing {M0.his}{F0.her} quarry until he slips up, and {0.SimFirstName} slaps some cuffs on him. Unfortunately, there’s no one available at the agency to process him! Oops.
The suspect’s response to being threatened? A surprisingly accurate detailing of prisoner’s rights according to domestic law and international human rights principles. Huh. {0.SimFirstName} is not getting anything out of this guy aside from a lesson in ethics. 
{M0.His}{F0.Her} getup attracts so much attention from strangers that {0.SimFirstName} finds it hard to get anything done. The mission is a total fail because {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t manage to be alone. 
Evil was just a lucky guess…all these henchmen look alike. The three share a few laughs and chat a bit about improvised surgery and the best way to burn off fingerprints.
The new partner does not react to that information well. Fortunately, he just thinks {0.SimFirstName} is only trying to test HIM, and doesn’t take it as the literal truth. That was close!
Really? All that work, and there’s no mole after all? {0.SimFirstName}’s findings make the agency even more suspicious, and now they are starting to think {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} in on it… 
{0.SimFirstName} enjoys a little “me time” in the office alone. Peeking in Co-workers’ desks, humming loudly to {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, making creative weapons from office supplies – good times! By the end of the day the budget dispute is ended but {0.SimFirstName} has to restart {M0.his}{F0.her} search from scratch.
After inspecting the electrical sockets, techs discover that the whole office is bugged! {0.SimFirstName}’s bosses praise {M0.his}{F0.her} spy instincts and promise to fast-track {0.SimPronounObjective} to Agent status. 
After some ingenious crypto-work, {0.SimFirstName} beats the firewall, and discovers that nothing is what it seems. {M0.He}{F0.She} rushes {M0.his}{F0.her} findings to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, and it turns out {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} uncovered a nefarious plot!
Internal Affairs carts {0.SimFirstName}'s mentor off kicking and screaming. He swears he's innocent, but that's what they all say. 
It turns out that the new guy’s a double agent too! Wacky! Now that they know the truth about each other, they are even more effective. 
Later, during a routine sweep, techs discover that the whole office was bugged! {0.SimFirstName} could have saved hours of compromised work if only {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} spoken up.
Slick move. The informant is very excited to be with {0.SimFirstName}, and gives up some great intel.
It takes a special mind to deliver on such a complicated case, and {0.SimFirstName} makes sure the suspect is caught and brought to justice. {M0.His}{F0.Her} handiwork will not go unrecognized by the higher-ups.
No one could have predicted that the villain would bring his foreign henchmen, but luckily the bookworm speaks their language like a pro. At least enough to say “Freeze—get down and put your hands up!”
Pssh, Lobro didn’t get where he is by mingling with the littles. Lobro’s henchmen tell {0.SimFirstName} that {M0.his}{F0.her} company is not appreciated, but they say it with punching.
