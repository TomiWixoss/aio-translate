Well, they did say they would pay anyone that participates. Even late and unfinished, the organizers gave {0.SimFirstName} the &quot;You Tried Prize&quot; as they called it. Where &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; they getting this money?
The client knew what they wanted, and {0.SimFirstName} gave it to them. It was drowned out by the other 20 games that company released at around the same time, but {F0.she}{M0.he} still got paid.
The client knew exactly what they wanted, and {0.SimFirstName} delivered. The result was fantastic, and earned a top spot in that company's hall of fame. This earned {F0.her}{M0.him} a hefty bonus!
Surprisingly, the client was not upset at all that {0.SimFirstName} failed to deliver. According to the representative, the company has hundreds of these projects going all the time, expecting a few to drop here and there. A prorated amount was paid to thank {0.SimFirstName} for {F0.her}{M0.his} time. Business as usual, it seems.
The game was delivered on time, much to the appreciation of the client. They've been expecting everything to go wrong, like they always do. {0.SimFirstName} is happy for {F0.him}{M0.her} but really wishes that {F0.he}{M0.she} would stop asking to be friends.
The client was very nice, and intensely driven. They had a complete launch plan ready, with soft launches and marketing beats. So when {0.SimFirstName} delivered the game ahead of schedule, the entrepreneur almost didn't know what to do. After a bit of freaking out, they added a bonus to the final payment.
The client was very disappointed that {0.SimFirstName} had nothing to show. Apparently, they are running low on funds as it is. Still, the client gave a small percentage of the pay hoping that the good deed will mean things will turn around for them soon.
As soon as {0.SimFirstName} sent the finished app over, {F0.she}{M0.he} started receiving stickers from the client. It was fun at first, but the constant flow of reaction GIFs and emotes is getting very tiring. At least the pay was nice.
{0.SimFirstName} delivered the app so fast, the client was able time it with the release of a highly anticipated new phone. This pushed downloads through the roof! The client decided to share a bit of the initial profits with {0.SimFirstName} a nice bonus.
&quot;We could be sending each other smiley faces and animated hugs right now!&quot;\n\n{0.SimFirstName} received some very angry text messages about failing to deliver. Then, possibly fearing the messages would be publicized, the company representative sent an apology and a small portion of the contract pay.
A dating app isn't the easiest piece of software to make, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to get it done on time. The company representative was delighted for a while, but then learned that their significant other has started using it... Best look the other way.
The dating world has just been rocked. The client insists that {0.SimFirstName} is the Cupid of modern society, whatever that means. No matter, {F0.she}{M0.he} received more than the agreed payment, so no complaints!
It appears that the one most disappointed by the failure to create a dating app was the partner of the one that put up the job posting. Who also turned out to be the president of the company. {0.SimFirstName} was paid a percentage of the contract amount out of spite.
{0.SimFirstName}'s product slogan proved to be &quot;just what the doctor ordered&quot;, according to the marketing exec. That poor exec seems stuck in the past, a relic of the pre-digital age. {0.SimFirstName} can't imagine that marketing firm will be around much longer, but their money is still good for now, at least.
The marketing execs are impressed at {0.SimFirstName}'s modern take on marketing copy. Not only did they decide to use the slogan {M0.he}{F0.she} ultimately submitted, but they think there's a lot of value in the off the cuff ideas {M0.he}{F0.she} dropped in their initial discussion... So much so, that they've decided to pay {M0.him}{F0.her} an additional bonus!
The marketing exec accused {0.SimFirstName} of lollygagging, as the submission deadline for the requested marketing copy had come and gone. Still, the exec was a {M0.woman}{F0.man} of {M0.her}{F0.his} word, and tossed {0.SimFirstName} some clams for the partial work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} managed to complete.
The marketing intern expressed {M0.her}{F0.his} thanks and gratitude. {0.SimFirstName}'s work on the magazine campaign arrived just in the nick of time; saving the intern from an embarrassing dismissal from {M0.her}{F0.his} temporary position at the firm.
&quot;{0.SimFirstName} this ad campaign is brilliant! Way better than my original scratch 'n sniff idea. The client was thrilled, my boss was satisfied... Best of all, the firm offered me a full time job! You're talking to a Marketing Assistant I now! I'm so grateful... here, take my signing bonus as an extra thank you.!&quot;
While {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the agreed upon work on time, the intern that'd secretly hired {M0.him}{F0.her} had a failure of {M0.her}{F0.his} own... The intern's boss discovered that {M0.she'd}{F0.he'd} outsourced {M0.her}{F0.his} work, and immediately booted {M0.her}{F0.him} from the firm's office. Thankfully, the marketing firm ended up having to pay {0.SimFirstName} a prorated amount for the work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} done to avoid infringing upon labor laws.
&quot;Oh honey, you did &lt;i&gt;so well&lt;/i&gt; on that newspaper ad! No seriously, &lt;i&gt;good job&lt;/i&gt;! It's really impressive in this day and age to find people still committed to working in a print medium. Here's your money; ta-ta!&quot;
&quot;Hmph. Even I, a digital copy editor, have to admit that you did a bang up job on that newspaper ad copy {0.SimFirstName}. Look, this doesn't change anything... print advertisement is still on the way out. With work like that though, my bosses may force me to keep contracting print freelancers for awhile longer. Ugh, just take your bonus and get out of here.&quot;
&quot;Hah, I knew you'd fail to get the gig completely finished on time. The world has moved past print ads, and it's clearly moved past you. Here... have this pittance for the work that you put in, but know that I'm just taking pity on you.&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} gave the client a ring, to let them know {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} completed {M0.his}{F0.her} work. They seemed to be in a hurry, only briefly glancing at {0.SimFirstName}'s updated copy before giving their approval. After receiving a swift payment, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to move on to {M0.his}{F0.her} next gig.
{0.SimFirstName} blitzed through the gig's tasks, churning out some hip marketing copy at record speed. Remarkably, a bunch of irreverent, adventurous, confident, and chill sims started engaging with the brand on Simstagram, sharing their approval of the refreshed product page. Success! The client was thrilled with {0.SimFirstName}'s work, and in addition to a monetary bonus, {M0.she}{F0.he} promised to treat {0.SimFirstName} to a chili dog meal if {M0.he's}{F0.she's} ever in the area. Strange...
The client called {0.SimFirstName}, clearly upset that {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} missed {M0.his}{F0.her} deadline for completing the gig's required tasks. {0.SimFirstName} could hear them chuckling on the other end of the line; surely an attempt to suppress their anger in the face of {0.SimFirstName}'s failure. Through clenched teeth, they remarked that {0.SimFirstName} would be paid for the portion of work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} completed, but the underlying message was clear... &lt;i&gt;&quot;Don't call back; don't waste our time again.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
{0.SimFirstName}'s proposed product logo has managed to achieve perfect brand synergy with the client's other offerings. That's no small feat! The client is happy to have retained {0.SimFirstName}'s services, and will keep {M0.him}{F0.her} in mind for future projects.
{0.SimFirstName}'s product logo is having a strange unintended affect... Test subje... ahem; Consumers are feeling a sudden and strong emotional bond to the brand, and without any prompting are taking it upon themselves to evangelize the product to other Sims. This fascinating development has the client thrilled, and they've kicked over a bonus payment {0.SimFirstName}'s way.
Boxes of the client's product are languishing on store shelves, as the generic branding is failing to resonate with modern consumers. This could have been avoided, had {0.SimFirstName} not missed the deadline to complete all of {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks. Thankfully, the contract clearly stated that {0.SimFirstName} must be compensated for the partial time {M0.he}{F0.she} did spend on the project.
The client was beyond impressed that {0.SimFirstName} was able to craft a compelling logo that'd be sure to carry the company forward into our bold Web 4.0 future. Truth be told, {0.SimFirstName} just painted the company's name in Helvetica font... but whatever, they seem happy.
The client was stunned when {0.SimFirstName} delivered a brand new logo that it looked like it could last all the way into a Web 5.0 world. What an accomplishment! They heralded {0.SimFirstName} as an artistic luminary, showered {M0.him}{F0.her} with a bonus payment, and insisted that {M0.he}{F0.she} give a motivational speech at the company's next town hall meeting.
The company's CEO is upset... {0.SimFirstName} was given a clear deadline to complete all of the tasks needed to craft a logo, and {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't come through. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} fortunate to have still received a partial payment after leaving the company with such an outdated logo in a rapidly moving Web 3.0 world.
{0.SimFirstName}'s sleek new company logo is making the client's business the talk of Sillisim Valley. No doubt venture capital firms will soon be in touch with funding offers. Watching the company's market cap skyrocket from the sidelines will be bittersweet, but at least {0.SimFirstName} got paid, and added some highly visible work to {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio.
The executive had to admit the {0.SimFirstName} did a fantastic job with the company's new logo, as venture capital firms had already started to beat down their headquarters doors with funding offers. While still refusing to offer any stock grants, {M0.she}{F0.he} acquiesced and sent {0.SimFirstName} a sizable bonus check.
{0.SimFirstName} missed the deadline to complete a new logo for the Sillisim Valley startup company that hired {0.SimPronounObjective}, and the company's angel investor is NOT happy. Oh well, it's not {0.SimFirstName}'s problem... That is, unless {M0.he}{F0.she} ever decides to switch freelancer trades and try {M0.his}{F0.her} hand at programming.
{0.SimFirstName} managed to get the last of the requested icons submitted, just as the clock ticked down to zero on the icon lock milestone. Good news - on top of the gig's payment, {0.SimFirstName}'s time spent on the project was just enough to ensure {M0.his}{F0.her} name is included in the game's credits. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} an official game dev now!
Squee! The studio's art director is head over heels in love with the game icons that {0.SimFirstName} created. They're. So. CUTE! Not only have they paid {M0.him}{F0.her} an added bonus for the top-notch work, but they decided to confer {M0.him}{F0.her} with honorary SimGuru status.
Uh oh - {0.SimFirstName} missed the icon lock milestone, and the project has a strict schedule to stick to. Thankfully, the game already has a rich pool of existing icons to draw from and reuse, but this certainly reflects poorly on {0.SimFirstName}'s professionalism. At least {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} still collect partial pay for the portion of work {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to complete.
{0.SimFirstName}'s app icon arrived to the team just in time for their mobile launch, and they unanimously agreed that {0.SimFirstName} nailed it. It wasn't long before {0.SimFirstName} started noticing more and more sims around town with their faces buried in their phones... Can this blight upon society be traced back to {M0.his}{F0.her} irresistible iconography? Oh well, at least the money was good.
The dev team's plans seemed ambitious, but with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed icon being put to use, their app's install base has skyrocketed upwards! Daily active users are off the charts! Engagement metrics are reaching unheard of levels! Even lapsed users are returning in droves, excited to be a part of this new digital sensation! The app's devs are likely out purchasing sports cars, yachts, mansions... whatever it is that rich people do... but they were nice enough to tell their accountant to kick a bonus {0.SimFirstName}'s way.
{0.SimFirstName} was unable to complete all of the required tasks in time, and the app's dev team missed their launch window. Absolute market saturation was &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; achieved. This app that was once destined for greatness, now faces an uphill battle just to claw its way back to the mobile store's front page. Still, {0.SimFirstName} managed to wrangle a partial payment for the time {M0.he}{F0.she} invested into the project.
Unsure about the job, {0.SimFirstName} completed the tasks while second guessing every word and action. It wasn't speedy, but it was done on time. The Simstagram representative thanked {F0.her}{M0.him} for the work and promised that more will come if {F0.she}{M0.he} wanted it. {0.SimFirstName} isn't so sure...
Simstagram may be cruel, but they're fair. Possibly motivated by the thinly veiled threat, {0.SimFirstName} finished the job in record time. {F0.She}{M0.He} was rewarded with a very decent amount of extra pay. It's almost worth the worry!
Simstagram was furious with the failure. {0.SimFirstName} tried to appeal to the company by complimenting how incredible their security was, but to no avail. Partial pay was given for the time spent, but {F0.she}{M0.he} couldn't shake the foreboding feeling that something bad is in store for {F0.her}{M0.him}.
{0.SimFirstName} delivered the report on time, much to the relief of the Landgraab representative. Apparently Landgraab receives over 150 attacks a day. It's hard to imagine that level of stress!
The representative from Landgraab was overjoyed at the quick delivery of the security report. They kept repeating that it was exactly what the company needed. {0.SimFirstName} wasn't so sure, but can't complain about the bonus given to {F0.her}{M0.him}.
The contact from Landgraab had a panic attack after being told that the job was not done in time. {0.SimFirstName} helped {0.SimPronounObjective} calm down by reassuring {0.SimPronounObjective} that {F0.she}{M0.he} was not going to lose {F0.her}{M0.his} job. As thanks, the contact allowed {0.SimFirstName} to keep a portion of the payment, but still filed a complaint.
{0.SimFirstName}'s report was answered with a very confusingly redacted email. It's a wonder how the NSSA operates with so much information missing in every message, but it doesn't matter as long as the payment goes through.
The completion of the job ahead of schedule was met with a heavily redacted email that somehow still had a very happy and excited tone. It's a wonder how the NSSA operates with so much information missing in every message, but at least extra payment can't be covered up!
After the deadline passed and {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} was sent a heavily redacted email. It was easy to tell the sender was upset, and the blanks seemed to only be covering adjectives instead of sensitive information... {0.SimFirstName} received a small payment for {F0.her}{M0.his} services.
The excitable representative loved the report that {0.SimFirstName} gave, and wouldn't stop praising {F0.her}{M0.him}. It was flattering at first, but it went on for far too long. After what seemed like an eternity, {F0.she}{M0.he} finally received the payment.
The contact from Bubbleplace reached impressive levels of excitement when {0.SimFirstName} completed {F0.her}{M0.his} report ahead of time. They went on and on about how impressive engineers are, which was flattering at first, but quickly became arduous. Still, {0.SimFirstName} received a nice bonus for {F0.her}{M0.his} efforts.
The contact from Bubbleplace seemed all too cheerful when {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the contract. Apparently, they considered it success in a way, thinking it just proved their security systems are that tough. They thanked {F0.her}{M0.him} for taking the time with a small payment.
The company might be shady, but they pay well. {0.SimFirstName} can't complain after receiving the paycheck, though {F0.she}{M0.he} can't get that strange feeling out of {F0.her}{M0.his} head that {F0.she}{M0.he} is seeing more spam mail...
Chain Mail, Inc. might seem a bit strange and shady, but they are very generous. When {0.SimFirstName} delivered {F0.her}{M0.his} report ahead of schedule, the company made sure to reward {0.SimPronounObjective} with a little extra payment.
Even though, {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} was still paid a portion of the agreed amount. The real punishment came later, when {F0.her}{M0.his} inbox was suddenly filled with spam mail.
{0.SimFirstName} delivered the report on time, much to the relief of the Llamacorn representative. Apparently, even as {F0.she}{M0.he} was working on the gig, Llamacorn received over 200 attacks!
The contact at Llamacorn was thrilled with the early report delivery. {0.SimFirstName} received a good bit more pay than {F0.she}{M0.he} was expecting, but no complaints here!
{0.SimFirstName}'s contact at Llamacorn became very suspicious of {0.SimPronounObjective} when told the job was not completed. In a hurry, {F0.she}{M0.he} was paid a small amount, thanked for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, and digitally shoved out the door.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forged painting is a true delight for the shady collector, who immediately hung it in a prominent position above {M0.her}{F0.his} fireplace. Hey, whatever makes them happy - as long as {0.SimFirstName} gets paid.
After submitting the forged painting, the true brilliance of the art collector's scheme came to light. The collector wasn't interested in adding {0.SimFirstName}'s painting to {M0.her}{F0.his} own personal collection... No, the collector was stealing the original, and replacing it with {0.SimFirstName}'s forged copy. {0.SimFirstName} was initially alarmed at the risk of being caught, but some extra hush money from the collector got {M0.him}{F0.her} to look the other way, for now...
The shady art collector is furious that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks on time. After threatening to tip off the authorities though, {0.SimFirstName} was still able to extract a partial payment for the time {M0.he}{F0.she} put in, which only seems fair.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forgery was convincing enough to allow the shady art dealer to quickly complete a sale to an all-too-eager collector, before too many questions could be asked.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forgery was immaculate; {M0.he}{F0.she} nailed every aspect of the recreation which could possibly be scrutinized. The dealer's customer brought in an independent expert to review the painting, who unwittingly authenticated it. The entire operation was an incredible success, and the dealer paid {0.SimFirstName} a handsome bonus - or maybe that was simply hush money?
