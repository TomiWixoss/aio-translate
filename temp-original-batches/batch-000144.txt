Customize your experience by selecting which Packs to load. Disabling Packs removes their specific content, such as hair, clothing, objects, and gameplay functions from saved games. We recommend only disabling Packs when starting a new Saved Game to avoid any unintended loss of content and progress.\n&lt;i&gt;Keep in mind, the confirmation process may take longer as more Packs are selected.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;font color='#EC262E'&gt;Warning&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Removing content from an existing Saved Game may have unintended gameplay consequences. We recommend only removing content after backing up your Saved Game or when starting a new Saved Game!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nA restart may be required.
