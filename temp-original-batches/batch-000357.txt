{0.SimFirstName} can't get the manifesto published anywhere. {M0.He}{F0.She} quietly hosts it on a personal website, which no one visits, and the movement dies a quick death.
That guerilla street artist, working on the side of trains, is the talk of the art world. With sponsorship from {0.SimFirstName}, the artist is able to hold his first gallery show. Everyone raves about it.
Viewers are caught off guard to see a talking palm tree, and many of them come to see the exhibition.
{0.SimFirstName}'s latest painting sells for more than anything else at the auction! By far! Surely the poodles shall write songs and poems of {0.SimFirstName}'s legendary generosity.
The magazine had never before featured an artist using {M0.his}{F0.her} body as a canvas. {0.SimFirstName}'s work is praised. 
The museum displays {0.SimFirstName}'s collection in a back room, with poor lighting. Maybe a new wing wouldn't have been such a bad idea.
{0.SimFirstName} keeps the student after class, for a stern talking to and more homework. The student quits on the spot and runs off to study with a local graffiti artist.
With extra attention, the class clown agrees to focus more on his technique. He soon seems to be making some progress using unconventional colors.
&quot;Still Life of a Barn&quot; doesn't push any boundaries. But its exquisite detail at least rounds out {0.SimFirstName}'s portfolio.

&quot;Sweet Grandpa&quot; confuses some viewers but adds to the whispered remarks about {0.SimFirstName}'s innovative style.
The editor is pleased with the layout and compliments {0.SimFirstName} on  {M0.his}{F0.her} design skills.
{0.SimFirstName}'s explanation that  the artist's most famous work, &quot;Is just a red square with a blue dot!&quot; draws several annoyed stares and a unanimous, &quot;You just don't get it.&quot; from the crowd.
{0.SimFirstName}'s explanation that the artist's most famous work, &quot;Is just a red square with a blue dot!&quot; draws several, &quot;I was thinking that, too!&quot; admissions from colleagues. Good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} spoke up!

Hands-On Approach

Try the Demo
Discredit Machine
{0.SimFirstName} finally pulls {M0.his}{F0.her} nose out of an art history book, brain overflowing with valuable data, only to see that class ended 20 minutes ago. Uh-oh.
Preparing is for mortals. A genius lives in the moment. {0.SimFirstName} crams like crazy and aces the exam.
Missing Model
{0.SimFirstName} is supposed to apply body paint to a model for a magazine shoot, but the model never showed! Thinking fast, {0.SimFirstName} realizes the only choices are to paint {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, or to cancel the photo shoot.
Museum Collection
A major museum wants to buy {0.SimFirstName} 's entire collection. Should {0.SimFirstName} sell the collection outright, or tell the museum they also have to build an honorary {0.SimFirstName} wing in which to display it?
Discussion Etiquette
Everyone is raving about the new work by the university's visiting artist. {0.SimFirstName} may decide to offer the counter opinion that the visiting artist is an overinflated hack, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could go along with popular consensus that his work changes art as we know it?
Residency Exchange
{0.SimFirstName} must do farm chores in exchange for {M0.his}{F0.her} artist residency. But raking in the garden has caused blisters to form on {M0.his}{F0.her} hand. Now holding a paintbrush hurts! Which begs the question: Skip the chores or toughen up?
Artistically Late
{0.SimFirstName} arrives late to the local art walk, and there's no more sidewalk space left to set up a table and sell watercolors. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could set up half in the street? Or would it be better to give up and just spend the night schmoozing? 
Oddly Heated Discussion
An artist who uses odd mediums, such as dirty bathwater and curdled milk, is always trying to engage {0.SimFirstName} in a heated discussion. Should {0.SimFirstName} argue art theory with her or ignore her?
{0.SimFirstName} is molding local art majors into tomorrow's virtuosos. {M0.He}{F0.She} just can't decide on the best approach to curriculum: let them get their hands dirty, or lecture them on theory instead?
Appraise-Bot 2000
{0.SimFirstName} is shocked to hear about &quot;Appraise-Bot 2000,&quot; a machine that studies brush strokes, color characteristics and 56 other key elements, spitting out an appraisal—in under 30 seconds. {0.SimFirstName} can either discredit the machine publicly, or try the Appraise-Bot 2000's free demo.
Interview Attire
{0.SimFirstName} will be interviewed by the local news about {M0.his}{F0.her} recently curated exhibition of &quot;Island Art.&quot; As a publicity stunt, should {M0.he}{F0.she} dress in the palm tree costume or just go with dress slacks and a nice shirt?
Bad Image
One day, at {0.SimFirstName}'s part-time art magazine job, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a bad reference image. Adjusting the layout is an option. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could just replace the image with {M0.his}{F0.her} own work.
The class clown in {0.SimFirstName}'s after school art program mixes the entire class supply of purple and yellow, creating something between &quot;pea soup&quot; and &quot;muddy rainwater.&quot; Is it better to keep Mr. Laugh Riot after class for extra tutoring—or boot him?
Harsh Critiques
{0.SimFirstName}'s work is being critiqued for the first time, and the response is especially harsh. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} get defensive and try to explain {M0.his}{F0.her} thought process, or quietly take notes and try to do better in the future?
Browsing through an art brokerage website, {0.SimFirstName} notices that a certain painting has been grossly undervalued. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take advantage of this deep discount, or contact the site to have them correct the mistake? 
Attendance at the museum has dropped since  {0.SimFirstName} took over as curator. To turn it around (and save {0.SimFirstName}'s reputation), should {M0.he}{F0.she} suggest the museum start holding social events or begin offering community classes?
The artist residency at this farm means two whole months for {0.SimFirstName} to create the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; for {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio. Which leads to the question: experimental work or something more mainstream?
Portfolio Piece
{0.SimFirstName} hired a model to sit for {M0.his}{F0.her} final portfolio piece, but after two sessions, the model leaves town for a family emergency.  {0.SimFirstName} will now need to finish the piece from memory—or start over.
A Review Bribe
{0.SimFirstName} is reviewing an exhibition for a major art magazine. On the sly, the gallery curator offers to show one of {0.SimFirstName}'s paintings later in exchange for a favorable review. Will {0.SimFirstName} accept the bribe—or be fair?
Manifesto 
{0.SimFirstName} may have invented a new movement: post-post-post-retro-cubist-fauv-modern-eccentricism. Is the next step writing a manifesto for the movement, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to convert more artists first?
A new gallery is calling for work. {0.SimFirstName} knows their last show was traditional, but {M0.he}{F0.she} just finished rolling around on canvases, covered in mustard, for a series entitled &quot;U = My Sunshine.&quot;  Should {0.SimFirstName} bring them the edgy work, or play it safe?
Forgotten Test
For an ART school, there sure is a lot of essay writing. {0.SimFirstName} has been so focused on developing {M0.his}{F0.her} craft that {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot the big essay test today! There's just enough time for a cram session, or to pull together a study group.
Fumes
{0.SimFirstName} accidentally inhales some turpentine fumes while cleaning the community ed room. Would a responsible employee take a rest and recover, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} power through the shift?
Grandfather Portrait
What began as a moving portrait of a grandfather's weathered face is looking more and more like an oatmeal cookie. {0.SimFirstName} can keep painting, or re-title it and call it done.
{0.SimFirstName} has a little capital from selling a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} private collection, which can either be used to sponsor an upcoming artist or to reinvest for the future. What to do?
Exhibit Label
Cleaning the museum one night, {0.SimFirstName} notices an exhibit label may list the incorrect artist. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} report it, proving {M0.his}{F0.her} masterful grasp of art history — or just use {M0.his}{F0.her} time to finish mopping?
Stained
After the big gallery show, one of {0.SimFirstName}'s paintings is returned to {M0.him}{F0.her} with a stain on the corner. Is it time to yell at the gallery owner, or try to remove the stain?
{0.SimFirstName} has been tapped to review a popular art show for one of the top art blogs. Is this an opportunity to give it to readers straight, or to remember that art is subjective?
New Technique
A promising young art student in {0.SimFirstName}'s class discovers the brilliant technique of &quot;raw goat's milk yogurt tempera painting.&quot; {0.SimFirstName} could now borrow this technique for {M0.his}{F0.her} upcoming big show, or let the student have credit.
The charity art auction needs {0.SimFirstName}'s work to raise money for homeless poodles. {M0.His}{F0.Her} recent stuff is worth more. But that means more money for the poodles and less for {0.SimFirstName}. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} just give them an older painting?
Dress Slacks, Nice Shirt
Palm Tree Costume
Adjust Layout
Replace With Own Art
{0.SimFirstName} forgets about the label and, in record time, finishes polishing every square inch of the museum floor into a blank canvas for tomorrow's feet.
Extra Tutoring
Boot Him
Art is all about expression, but c'mon... {0.SimFirstName} boots the troublesome student and now has the class—and the color mixing—back under control.
Quietly Take Notes
Defend the Art
{0.SimFirstName} was wrong -- the label was accurate! Now {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll}  never get that big promotion to gift shop cashier.
{0.SimFirstName} was correct! It wasn't even a cubist work. It was a replica of an ancient cave painting!  Who would mislabel that?!
{0.SimFirstName} waits until the cafeteria monitor is near, then shouts for the mean kid to unhand {M0.his}{F0.her} food. The monitor quickly walks over and scolds the mean kid in front of everybody. All that AND {0.SimFirstName} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} bag of chips too!
{0.SimFirstName} shrugs. Squirms. Then tries to explain about hard work and trying your best and how goofing off just makes you look dumb. It sounds right to {0.SimPronounObjective}, but the spitball that whizzes by {M0.his}{F0.her} head tells {0.SimPronounObjective} that wasn’t the right answer.
{0.SimFirstName} finishes the last few questions correctly and decides to hope for the best. The school likes to brag about its test scores, but how much can one test matter? Unfortunately, the teacher thinks it matters a LOT. She assigns extra work for the next month to ensure that {0.SimFirstName} catches up.
{0.SimFirstName} picks a seat way in the back where the girl won’t go (too far from the board). Of course, now it’s a lot harder to see the teacher write on the board and {0.SimFirstName}’s not getting called on anymore…
{0.SimFirstName} scribbles a note and passes it back to the kid: “Stop or I’ll tell.” The kid wads up the paper and fires it at {0.SimFirstName}, but it misses and rolls up to the teacher’s feet. For once, somebody else gets in trouble, and {0.SimFirstName} gets off scot free! 
{0.SimFirstName} is just placing the cookie into the open bag when a loudmouth kid accuses {M0.him}{F0.her} of going through someone else’s lunch! Before {0.SimFirstName} can answer, the teacher appears and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} write an apology, up on the board where everyone can see. No good deed...
It’s not always the best move to involve the teacher, but seeing as {0.SimFirstName}’s only in grade school it’s not the worst idea. Caught with marker still on his hands, the culprit is sent to the principal and worse, home to his furious mom.
{0.SimFirstName} knows better than to chew someone else’s gum, especially with all the flu bugs going around. Unfortunately, {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher finds it at Free Time and makes {0.SimPronounObjective} scrape all the desks. So unfair!
