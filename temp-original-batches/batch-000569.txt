Tassels
Every tassel has been found and the collection is complete.\n\nKhun Mae would be proud! Her story is also one that ended in victory, with the people of Tomarang cheering and showering their saviors in gifts and glory. For her bravery, Khun Mae was made Leader of the village. But as she rejoiced, she was also left bewildered by her sacrifice's outcome: a soul split in two. A tiger sat quietly in the crowd, watching her, waiting for her command. This tiger was special, as it now carried the other half of her soul. She knew they would be bonded for life, so she snipped a tassel from her shirt and tied it around its neck. The village embraced them both and Tomarang lived on in peace, thriving under The Great Mother and her other half. Legend has it, these are the very same tassels she once wore!\n\nClick on a tassel in your Sim's &lt;b&gt;Inventory&lt;/b&gt; to combine all 10 colors into a special reward.
