A Change of Scenery
The Weakest Link
Burn Out!
The teacher decides to provide {0.SimFirstName} with a little life lesson. (Isn’t it great when they do that?) {0.SimFirstName} learns that if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants a better grade, {M0.he}{F0.she} should study harder first instead of cry about it after.
The teacher is still not back by the end of class, so it doesn’t matter that {0.SimFirstName} started {M0.his}{F0.her} other homework first. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} just do {M0.his}{F0.her} reading at home later.
The truth is that the material is hard, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t always feel compelled to try harder. The guidance counselor’s a little surprised at the honesty, but grateful that the issue isn’t something more severe. 
So trusting, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are. {M0.He}{F0.She} picks an unlocked locker and snatches a lunch. Someone’s mom has a lot of time on her hands, because this is a feast!
All it takes is a few answers to make sure that {0.SimFirstName}’s friend passes. Now {M0.his}{F0.her} friend owes {0.SimPronounObjective} a gigantic favor—not a bad position to be in!
{0.SimFirstName} paints such a bleak picture of {M0.his}{F0.her} home life that the counselor insists on talking to {M0.his}{F0.her} parents about {M0.his}{F0.her} living conditions. Uh-oh. 
All {0.SimFirstName} has to do is walk around the lunchroom and {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are happy to share whatever they don’t want. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets so much food, {M0.he}{F0.she} might just forget {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch every day!
All high-achievers take the test at least twice—some five or six times. {0.SimFirstName} is confident {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} get the result {M0.he}{F0.she} wants eventually! 
{0.SimFirstName} is so slammed trying to study for another round of testing while finishing {M0.his}{F0.her} regular schoolwork, that {M0.he}{F0.she} has trouble concentrating. {M0.His}{F0.Her} next test score is even lower!
The other kids agree that they should just do it, but when it comes time for grades, the teacher can tell that {0.SimFirstName} hasn’t been pulling {M0.his}{F0.her} weight. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a grade lower than the rest of the group.
It takes a fair amount of self-control, but ignoring the bullies works. Eventually they get bored and move on to a different target. {0.SimFirstName} feels a little bad for that other kid, but hey, school is a jungle sometimes!
{0.SimFirstName} spends so much time trying to figure out answers that {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves half the bubbles unfilled. {M0.He}{F0.She} would have done better just to take the random guesses.
How about that! {0.SimFirstName} has learned more than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. {M0.He}{F0.She} earns a passing grade on the test.
{M0.His}{F0.Her} presentation blows the other students’ out of the water. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets the highest grade in the class, and the teacher submits {0.SimPronounObjective} for Student of the Millennium.
It’s weird, but things seem to make a little more sense coming from {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates than the teacher. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} actually starting to wrap {M0.his}{F0.her} head around this!
Without {M0.his}{F0.her} notes, the rival is lost…{0.SimFirstName} aces the next few tests and {M0.his}{F0.her} rival has to work twice as hard just to keep up.
{M0.He}{F0.She} made the productive, non-frivolous choice, and {M0.he}{F0.she} got an extra half-hour of study time in. Excellent. This will definitely make a difference, come college application time.
It really is okay to take a short break now and then. {0.SimFirstName}’s brain reaches information overload, and {M0.he}{F0.she} goes back into class feeling more overworked than ever!
Since {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t have to think about the answers, it’s a very quick and stress-free test! {M0.He}{F0.She} spends the extra time daydreaming. 
{M0.He}{F0.She} plucks a sack out of the first unlocked locker {M0.he}{F0.she} sees, but when {0.SimFirstName} opens the bag {M0.he}{F0.she} discovers a half-dissected frog. Gross! Who keeps that in a locker?! Serves {0.SimFirstName} right for being a sneak.
{M0.He}{F0.She} tries to do the reading, but {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t concentrate since {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} thinking about that mountain of homework. At the end of class, {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t even remember what {M0.he}{F0.she} just read.
It’s just too far over {M0.his}{F0.her} head, and {0.SimFirstName} gets a poor grade. Now it’s going to be even harder to get out of this class with a B or higher!
It was going to be a quiet working day anyway, and {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates barely notice the difference. It’s not like {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} lecturing them on the periodic table or anything.
Darn it! {0.SimFirstName}’s tattling actually woke the kid up! By the time the teacher looks over in his direction, he’s sitting straight up, bright-eyed and grinning from ear to ear. The teacher admonishes {0.SimFirstName} for wasting time. 
{0.SimFirstName} skims over the important material before the test. {M0.His}{F0.Her} score ends up being right in the middle of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates’. Coulda been better, coulda been worse. Perfect C student performance.
Although the class has a good time, the teacher springs a pop quiz later, and nobody is prepared. Despite the fun they had, they blame {0.SimFirstName} for this quizaster.
The students run screaming outside, and so many scatter that classes are called off for the rest of the day! {0.SimFirstName} better wrap up that assignment tonight!
{0.SimFirstName} successfully pushes the drone of snoring out of his mind so {M0.he}{F0.she} can focus on the drone of the teacher’s voice. No problem!
Not only did {0.SimFirstName} manage to score a few extra points toward {M0.his}{F0.her} final grade, the extra practice actually helped {0.SimPronounObjective} understand the material better!
{0.SimFirstName} is able to manage a good grade on the difficult test, but the answers for the easy test didn’t come quite as easy as {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} hoped. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a B+ and a C-. Rats.
{0.SimFirstName} is just thinking about how {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not going to think about the snoring anymore when the teacher suddenly calls on {M0.him}{F0.her}. Wait, what was the question? Um... The other students laugh while {0.SimFirstName} wonders how {M0.HE’S}{F0.SHE’S} the one who gets in trouble!
Turns out that pulling the fire alarm is mildly illegal. For the foreseeable future, {0.SimFirstName}’s free study time will now be detention time. And {M0.he}{F0.she} still got a zero on the assignment.
{0.SimFirstName}’s best educated guess turns out to be right! And the final grade on the test isn’t that bad. {M0.He}{F0.She} might just be getting the hang of this!
{0.SimFirstName} lifts a few answers, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} test back, it turns out the other student was clueless, too. {M0.He}{F0.She} didn’t get caught, but {M0.he}{F0.she} still fails the test. Thanks for nothing, kid!
{0.SimFirstName}'s all caught up on {M0.his}{F0.her} sleep for the day. And if the teacher noticed she didn’t care, at least not enough to interrupt movie day. 
{0.SimFirstName} studies and practices like mad, and greatly improves {M0.his}{F0.her} grade on today’s test! It turns out {M0.his}{F0.her} reward was directly proportional to {M0.his}{F0.her} effort!
{0.SimFirstName} focuses hard and reviews ALL of the material—and it pays off big time. {M0.He}{F0.She} scores higher on the test than anyone else in the class. The teacher congratulates {M0.him}{F0.her} on a job well done!
The test was harder than {0.SimFirstName} thought it would be, and {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t know many of the answers. {M0.He}{F0.She} squeaks out a pass, but now {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll have to work extra hard in the class.
{0.SimFirstName} stands {M0.his}{F0.her} ground. {M0.He}{F0.She} can’t risk {M0.his}{F0.her} own grade, after all! The friend doesn’t like that, swearing never to help {0.SimFirstName} ever again.
Who says a formal education doesn’t pay off? By the end of the day {0.SimFirstName} will leave this school a little wiser and a little richer!
What good is a study group? A book’s a book, no matter how many people are there when you read it. Can a study group teach you street smarts?? That’s what {0.SimFirstName} wants to know.
Losing those notes makes the rival fall so far behind, {M0.he}{F0.she} comes to {0.SimFirstName} for help because “everyone knows {0.SimFirstName} is the smartest.” {0.SimFirstName} feels so guilty {M0.he}{F0.she} winds up tutoring {M0.his}{F0.her} rival during study time.
The other student seems to know his stuff! His answer makes perfect sense. {0.SimFirstName} should sit next to him in every class. Hey, maybe this is one of those alternative learning styles {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} heard about!
