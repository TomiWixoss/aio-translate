{0.SimFirstName} decides to take a job as a performer at a child’s birthday party. How hard can it be? When the child asks {M0.him}{F0.her} to juggle, though, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not sure {M0.he}{F0.she} remembers how. {M0.He}{F0.She} can try it-not much looks breakable in here-or try to distract the child.
{0.SimFirstName} has been practicing and practicing a section of a score and just can't quite get it right. It is more than a little frustrating. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} keep at it, or take a break?
{0.SimFirstName} hopes to make some extra cash on the side by teaching piano to neighborhood kids, but {M0.his}{F0.her} very first student spills soda all over the piano keys. {M0.He}{F0.She} can tell the little barbarian to come back next week, once it’s fixed, or charge the mother for cleaning and repair.
Hired to play piano for a private black-tie event, {0.SimFirstName} forgets to pick up {M0.a tux}{F0.an evening gown} at the rental shop. With no time left and limited options, {M0.he}{F0.she} can either borrow one that’s a little tight or dress down and hope no one notices.
While performing at a private party, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly draws a complete blank. What’s the next line? {M0.He}{F0.She} can improvise or just stop and save some face.
After a regular gig at a comedy club, {0.SimFirstName} notices {M0.his}{F0.her} paycheck is a little light. {M0.He}{F0.She} can go confront the owner right now, or hang tight until {M0.his}{F0.her} second set later on.
{0.SimFirstName} knew it wasn’t a great idea to start {M0.his}{F0.her} comedy set so late. The crowd is getting rowdy, and {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} losing control fast. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either yell to get their attention or give up and shut it down.
It isn’t easy to find piano bars these days, but {0.SimFirstName} is lucky like that. {M0.His}{F0.Her} sad, sweet melodies have everyone feeling all right, until a former favorite comes back and reclaims the bench for himself. {0.SimFirstName} can play this two ways: offer to let him play a set, or tell him to move along.
{0.SimFirstName}’s power-drill jingle is just about to air when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a women’s deodorant commercial is using a very similar tune. What’s worse, {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t remember whether {M0.he}{F0.she} heard it before or after {M0.he}{F0.she} wrote {M0.his}{F0.her} jingle. {0.SimFirstName} can alert {M0.his}{F0.her} client, or hope that no one notices.
{0.SimFirstName} is at a friend’s birthday party when all falls quiet. To liven things up {M0.he}{F0.she} tries out a few gags from {M0.his}{F0.her} latest routine, but is not getting any reaction from the guests. {M0.He}{F0.She} can dial it up, or shut it down.
Uh oh. {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is double-booked to play at a starlet’s private party and a charity event for third-world hunger. The good cause could give {M0.him}{F0.her} an out, but the starlet is known for her temper … and killer parties.
{0.SimFirstName} is asked to collaborate on the script for the Music Awards, to help the MC, but the final script doesn’t include any of {0.SimFirstName}’s jokes. {M0.He}{F0.She} could say nothing and settle for a nice check, or go to bat for a few of {M0.his}{F0.her} better gags.
Toward the end of a luxurious launch party, {0.SimFirstName} runs out of material. {M0.He}{F0.She} could easily repeat a few numbers without anyone taking notice, or use the opportunity to try out a classical world rock fusion ballad {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been composing.
At a joke-off, another comic goes for potty humor. {0.SimFirstName} can sink to his level, or try to rise above the stink and keep it clean.
{0.SimFirstName} has created the best kitty litter jingle ever! But when {M0.he}{F0.she} pitches it to {M0.his}{F0.her} client, the VP of Dumbing Things Down asks {0.SimPronounObjective} to work in the word “piddle” based on recent market research. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} make the change, or fight for {M0.his}{F0.her} art?
Uh oh. {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is double-booked for a friend’s party, which {M0.he}{F0.she} agreed to do for free, and a high-paying corporate event. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} give up the paycheck and help {M0.his}{F0.her} friend’s party, or do the corporate event and bail on {M0.his}{F0.her} friend?
{0.SimFirstName} has been invited to give the toast at {M0.his}{F0.her} best friend’s wedding. At last, a captive audience! Does {M0.he}{F0.she} play it safe and keep the friend’s skeletons in the closet, or bare all in the hopes of a good laugh and maybe even a gig?
{0.SimFirstName} has just won over the crowd at a local event when some attention-hog gets jealous and starts heckling {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} can play it two ways-take Mr. Funny Guy head on, or repay his insults with silence.
Regular gigs are great, and so are regular fans. Until {0.SimFirstName}’s fans get a bit unruly. When a {M0.gaggle of table-dancing girls breaks}{F0. sweaty moshpit of men break} 3 different tables on 3 different nights, the club manager tells {0.SimFirstName} to get it under control or get off the stage. Will {M0.he}{F0.she} confront {M0.his}{F0.her} fans or take the party elsewhere?
{0.SimFirstName} has stumbled upon an Open Mic night at a local coffeehouse. Might be a good chance to brush up on {M0.his}{F0.her} guitar skills! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} win over the crowd with a couple of well-loved cover songs or play some original material instead?
{0.SimFirstName} has attained the honor of performing with one of the most celebrated cellists of all time-who is also a great musical influence. But while they are practicing, {0.SimFirstName} hears a part he seems to be playing incorrectly. {M0.He}{F0.She} can point it out or trust that the maestro knows what he’s doing.
{0.SimFirstName} is MCing a special press party for a new product launch. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} on fire, roasting the competition, when {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been bashing the wrong company. {M0.He}{F0.She} can play it off like {M0.he}{F0.she} knew {M0.his}{F0.her} mistake all along, or make a quick exit and hope people forget the gaff.
What’s scarier than Mozart’s darkest symphonies? A bride who doesn’t get her way. Or at least, the bride who is standing over {0.SimFirstName} screaming about a “playlist” of classical music {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to prepare. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either apologize for the mistake or remind the bride that she never sent it.
{0.SimFirstName} enters a comedy contest, but just before {M0.he}{F0.she} goes on, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that the person before {0.SimPronounObjective} is using jokes from {M0.his}{F0.her} set. Should {0.SimFirstName} call him on it when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the mic, or come up with something new fast?
At last! {0.SimFirstName} has found a real gig! Well, okay, it’s amateur night and pretty much anyone with a pulse can perform, but {0.SimFirstName} is officially on the list. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} invite friends, or consider this a private test run?
With just a few keystrokes, {0.SimFirstName} calculates a new course and punches in the coordinates. {M0.He}{F0.She} flies well clear of the asteroids and even catches a nice glimpse of the Northern Lights. 
{M0.He}{F0.She} disengages the fuel lock and dumps thousands of gallons of propellant into space. Then the senior officer takes the stick and they head for the nearest space garage.
There’s a minor altercation outside the venue where a fan gets a little handsy with the singer. She’s okay, but her handlers raise such a stink with the Star Council that {0.SimFirstName} gets blamed for it. 
{M0.His}{F0.Her} grade isn’t great, but {0.SimFirstName} squeaks out a pass…just barely.
Turns out the astronauts took the shuttle on an unapproved joyride, and they all get fired. Although {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t like feeling like a snitch, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss takes note of {M0.his}{F0.her} attention to detail. Also, those astronauts were kind of jerks anyway.
None of the boys had any contraband. In fact, they were studying for a big exam. This is exactly why the Planet Patrol is not very popular in this sector. {0.SimFirstName} is going to deal with the fallout from this for a while...
This reminds {0.SimFirstName} of that old video game about asteroids - it was called SPACE ROCK BLASTERS.  {M0.He}{F0.She} wends {M0.his}{F0.her} way through the asteroid field without getting even a scratch on the shuttle’s paint job.
No good deed goes unpunished - no sooner does {0.SimFirstName} sell out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mid-priced skins than a competitor enters the market, charging triple. He sells out and makes a fortune that could have been {0.SimFirstName}'s.
People are so disgusted and outraged that a citizen’s commission forms in order to deal with the trash situation. They get paid by private donation, so the sheriff’s department saves money, too!
There’s a reason the senior officer is the senior officer: to make these calls. Doesn’t {0.SimFirstName} trust him? He shoves {0.SimFirstName} off the driver’s seat and performs the fuel dump himself, and chews {0.SimFirstName} out the whole way to the space garage.
Nobody cares. Nobody cleans. Nobody changes a darn thing. Eventually, the galaxy is swimming in refuse and {0.SimFirstName}’s got to figure something else out. 
Some space monsters just want to watch the galaxy burn. {0.SimFirstName} is fine stepping into some moral grey areas, but this gangster has no code of conduct at all! Even though it makes {M0.him}{F0.her} look weak, {0.SimFirstName} has to bail on the job.
The crowds are so unruly and uncontrollable that the singer’s private security never could have handled it on their own. {0.SimFirstName}’s deputies help preserve order, and as a thank you, the singer makes a generous donation to {0.SimFirstName}’s department. 
The team delivers beautifully, and they gather tons of useful data for {0.SimFirstName}. They describe new plant and animal species, write down a new alien language, and discover potable water on an alien world.
Word spreads that {0.SimFirstName}'s prices are out of line and soon {M0.his}{F0.her}line of customers dries up. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s single-handedly deflated demand for the product. Soon {M0.he}{F0.she} has to drop {M0.his}{F0.her} prices to lower than market rate, just to get the skins off {M0.his}{F0.her} hands.
{0.SimFirstName} climbs into the pod and launches toward home. {M0.He}{F0.She} watches the ship retreat in {M0.his}{F0.her} rearview mirror, and sees the fire go out on its own. {M0.He}{F0.She} shouldn’t have bailed-now the mission’s a failure and {0.SimFirstName} has no way to recover the shuttle.
{0.SimFirstName} triangulates the origin of the transmission and follows it to the source…an alien ship! {0.SimFirstName} flies the flag of universal peace and makes the first recorded contact with a new race of alien beings. They are very proficient at math and love éclairs. 
The task isn’t too difficult, but {0.SimFirstName}’s team executes flawlessly. The rest of the agency knows that they’re dependable in a pinch.
While {0.SimFirstName}’s deputies are acting as glorified babysitters, smugglers and bandits have the solar system to themselves. You could steal Galactic Hall! The Star Council chides {0.SimFirstName} for leaving the galaxy understaffed.
Between the Endangered Space Species Act and the Carnivorous Plant Weapons Treaty, {0.SimFirstName}’s got enough problems with government regulation. The upside just isn’t worth getting caught. {0.SimFirstName} coughs up the taxes.
The team never quite makes it to the right coordinates, so they see nothing, hear nothing, and discover nothing. They come home empty-handed and {0.SimFirstName}’s got to answer for it. 
{0.SimFirstName} leaves the suspect handcuffed at a Space Gas station. When {M0.he}{F0.she} returns from stopping the hijacking, the suspect is still there, surly as ever. {0.SimFirstName} makes the collar on both cases.
The gangster throws some epic parties and pays so well that {0.SimFirstName} can spend {M0.his}{F0.her} time counting money instead of thinking about ethics.
Rules are there for a reason. Once {M0.he}{F0.she} gets approval to install the system, {M0.he}{F0.she} does. The pilots like it and everyone gives {0.SimFirstName} a polite round of applause. 
{0.SimFirstName} tries to calculate the new course in {M0.his}{F0.her} head, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} types in the new coordinates {M0.he}{F0.she} flies totally off-track. Now {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got to work to bring the ship back into orbit before {M0.he}{F0.she} floats away!
Out of the thousand crates in the warehouse, the customs inspector picks {0.SimFirstName}’s to open…he discovers the tiles and fines {0.SimFirstName} more money than {M0.he}{F0.she} would have spent on taxes in the first place.
Sleep isn’t a substitute for actually knowing the answers. {0.SimFirstName} feels great, but {M0.he}{F0.she} still doesn’t know anything about Space Geography. {M0.He}{F0.She} fails, and it will be a while before {M0.he}{F0.she} can retake the test.
{M0.He}{F0.She} might have gotten a decent grade...if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} stayed awake through the whole exam. But {0.SimFirstName} was so exhausted that {M0.he}{F0.she} fell asleep right at {M0.his}{F0.her} desk. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} has to wait months to take the test again.
Nobody listens to {0.SimFirstName}, and although {M0.he}{F0.she} collects some money in fines, the space jails and star courts are now filling up with litterbugs. The whole thing is becoming more trouble than it’s worth.
Turns out the gangster was looking to clean up his act. Not a lot, of course, just enough to organize and expand his profits. {0.SimFirstName} could have been the one to lead that organization effort. Sounds like it would have been a pretty plush job!
Better to finish the arrest in progress before charging off on another mission. A Flornaxian Fire Bird in the hand, etc... {0.SimFirstName} will focus on getting one evildoer off of the spacelanes, and let {M0.his}{F0.her} colleagues handle the bigger case.
As soon as the pilots start using {0.SimFirstName}’s system, they realize how much easier they've made things. The feedback on the system is so positive, no one cares that {M0.he}{F0.she} broke the rules.
The client would have paid some major Simoleons to move those dire space chinchillas, and now he’s not happy. He’s trash-talking {0.SimFirstName} all across the galaxy, and pledging all future business to {0.SimFirstName}’s closest competitor. Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to work twice as hard to turn a profit in this sector!
As soon as the pilots start to use it, the system crashes. Now the pilots have to work twice as hard to drive the shuttle, and they tell everyone about {0.SimFirstName}’s dumb plan. {M0.He}{F0.She} is disciplined and forced to clean the lavatories as punishment. 
Everyone knows that customs is the worst-funded part of any government. The tiles sail through undetected and {0.SimFirstName} saves a lot of money.
When {0.SimFirstName} shows up at the rendezvous point with the dire chinchillas, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds half the Planet Patrol there-{M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been set up! {0.SimFirstName} quickly sets {M0.his}{F0.her} ferocious cargo on the Patrol agents and escapes, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has nothing to show for this job.
One of the kids had a laserblade in his pocket-supporting the buzz that young Glorzaks have been gathering weapons lately. Maybe now the Planet Patrol will be able to find and shut down their supplier.
{0.SimFirstName} worries that for the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} life, when things get quiet, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} wonder what that sound was…could it have been the key to understand all of life? Could it have been coded directions to a space treasure? {0.SimFirstName} will never know.
{0.SimFirstName} didn’t see the reports that young Glorzaks have been gathering weapons. Later, one of the boys in the group robs a spacemarket with a pocket laserblade. Could {0.SimFirstName} have prevented the crime?
The Glorzaks were just hanging out, and they appreciated that {0.SimFirstName} didn’t harass them. They share some xxulyps with {M0.him}{F0.her} (they’re like donuts) and give {M0.him}{F0.her} the inside scoop on what’s happening in this sector. Nice kids!
Luckily, the new client has deep pockets. When {0.SimFirstName} delivers the dire chinchillas, he pays {M0.him}{F0.her} double the street value of the critters. And {0.SimFirstName} only suffered a few minor lacerations-no problem!
Just because they’re expensive doesn’t mean they will last a long time or work well. Those panels are junk, and {0.SimFirstName} has to replace them all anyway.
Aha! A faulty connector widget was causing the error messages-the panels are fine after all! Good thing {0.SimFirstName} checked them out.
Sweet Talk the Guard
Use {M0.His}{F0.Her} Authority
Although the old client is angry at {0.SimFirstName} for dumping the moon rocks, the new job has a huge payday. {0.SimFirstName} comes out ahead, and the new client is now a regular client.
{0.SimFirstName} dumps the moon rocks and agrees to take the new job, but the new client never shows up to meet her. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} been played! Now {0.SimFirstName}’s out a lot of cargo, {M0.his}{F0.her} old client is angry, and the new client is nowhere to be found.

{0.SimFirstName} maneuvers the shuttle into landing position, and lets gravity do the rest. {M0.He}{F0.She} didn’t burn up any extra fuel and managed to safely land the craft.
As the shuttle hits the ground, the broken thruster collapses, and the whole ship breaks apart. Luckily it’s just a computer simulation, but {0.SimFirstName} won’t be piloting any real ships anytime soon.
{0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are screaming in {M0.his}{F0.her} ear, but the grateful astronauts inside the shuttle are glad {M0.he}{F0.she} made the safe call. {0.SimFirstName} has the team look into the equipment to find out what’s wrong.

{0.SimFirstName} emerges on the other side of the wormhole, with no memory of recent events. It feels like it’s been several days, but according to the ship’s high-precision digital chronograph it’s only been a few minutes. What happened in the wormhole? And why does {0.SimFirstName} feel so strange?
