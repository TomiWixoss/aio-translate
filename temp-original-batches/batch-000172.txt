Recommended Worlds
I recommend checking out &lt;b&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Oasis Springs!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nYou can always get more info on a World by hovering over it.
Welcome to &lt;b&gt;Residential Worlds,&lt;/b&gt; where you get to choose the perfect world for your Household to live!
This World does not have any good starter Lots for you. I recommend you select &lt;b&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Oasis Springs&lt;/b&gt; instead for now!
Continue Anyway
Never Mind
This Lot doesn't have a starter home built on it. I recommend you move to one that has a starter home instead!
Bulldozing a Lot will result in no house being present. I recommend moving into a Furnished home instead!
No Starter Homes
If you decide to start on this World, you'll need to &lt;b&gt;build&lt;/b&gt; the entire home for your Household. But don't worry! You can always go back to the &lt;b&gt;Residential Worlds!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI'd recommend going back and selecting &lt;b&gt;Willow Creek&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Oasis Springs&lt;/b&gt; instead.
Furnished
This screen allows you to select a move in option. Since this is your first starter home, try selecting &lt;b&gt;&quot;Furnished&quot;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nDon't like the flow of things? You can always redecorate or change your furniture later!

Interaction
Adding a new Vacation Rental lot to any world is easy! Travel to any lot that does not have a Household already occupying it. Once in Build Mode, on the upper left hand side of the screen, select the Venue Info icon. From there, the venue can be changed to “Vacation Rental” from the Lot Type drop down. This lot is now a Vacation Rental Lot. While in Build Mode, be sure to place any objects you’d like to have available to future vacationers.
While on vacation, Build Mode is locked. Sims on vacation in Residential Worlds may purchase necessities on their phone in the Household section with the “Order Supplies Now…” interaction. Destination Worlds have unique locations to purchase supplies for that world.
When Sims reserve their home away from home, the active Household must pay daily rent up front. Rent is dependent on the Lot Value for the selected Lot. There is a drop down that allows players to choose how many days they would like their vacationers to rent the lot. A total tally of cost is displayed on the bottom right hand side of this menu. Helpful Tip: Once in game, Sims may use the Travel section of their Phone to choose to extend their vacation or end it early. 
Upgrades
Some Upgrade benefits will make objects perform better, not break, or provide emotional benefits to Sims.
As your Handiness Skill improves, you'll be able to find rare Upgrade Parts and unlock more powerful upgrades.
Sims in the Focused Emotion will generally be better at upgrading household items.
Sims need to use Upgrade Parts to upgrade items. These can be found in piles of junk next to broken objects or even in garbage cans!\n\nYou can also purchase upgrade parts from the Order menu, if you have enough Handiness skill.

Rocket Science Skill
The Rocket Science skill is built using the Rocket Ship.  What Rocket Ship?  That's classified.\n\nOr… you could try being an Astronaut.
Space, a frontier. Some say the final one--but not the Rocket Scientist!  Sims with the Rocket Science skill see space as only the beginning!
Increasing the Rocket Science skill will increase your build speed and unlock new Upgrades for your Rocket Ship.

Higher quality paintings can provide powerful Emotional benefits.\n\nHave your Sim paint while in an Emotion, hang your creation on a wall, and choose View to recreate the Emotions imbued within the paint into your Sim.
Sims who are good enough at Painting could sell their paintings as an alternate career!
Sims in the Inspired Emotion will generally paint better, but explore all of the emotions while painting to bring out your inner artist.
