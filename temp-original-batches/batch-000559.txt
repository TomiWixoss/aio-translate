{0.SimFirstName} ate the Forbidden Fruit!? Ok, don't panic! It'll be alright, just try and act natural.\n\nNO really! Natural... like a plant. Drink lots of water and stay in the sun, and {M0.he}{F0.she} will flourish and photosynthesize, which will replenish {M0.his}{F0.her} hunger.\n\nKeep in mind that as a PlantSim, {M0.he}{F0.she} won't need to eat regular food. Thankfully, that also means that {M0.he}{F0.she} won't have to go to the bathroom either!
