Avoid the (Hypothetical) Booby Traps
The results show that this ship once belonged to the Boronians, creatures of pure Boron. This is useful scientific data, as very little is known of creatures of the fifth element. Scans continue now that the results have been seen, and the rocket backs out of the wreck. What happened just before?
Even in space, nature calls. {0.SimFirstName} docks with a starside rest station. It's pretty nasty in there…but then {0.SimFirstName} looks closely at the top of the toilet and discovers that it's inhabited by a teensy tiny alien civilization!
With {0.SimFirstName}’s help, the colonists quickly access Hiattooine’s food replicators. Not only are they making non-grilled cheese, but they’re making them 1,000 times faster than before! Buried under an avalanche of inedible sandwiches, the government surrenders, agreeing to reopen talks if the colonists undo their handiwork. A victorious {0.SimFirstName} flies home, reward in hand.
{0.SimFirstName} puts a paltry few boxes in the back of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. One box is smoking, and another's making a whimpering sound, but {0.SimFirstName} doesn't ask questions. {M0.He}{F0.She} delivers it on time and makes a few extra bucks.
While passing the asteroid belt, {0.SimFirstName} notices something ducking behind a nearby rock. {0.SimFirstName} slowly guides {M0.his}{F0.her} ship in to investigate.
Correct! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} zooms through the cosmos, arriving at a debris field. What should {F0.she}{M0.he} do?!
{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the seemingly undamaged station, but hears some odd laughter echoing down the halls. {M0.He}{F0.She} follows the strange sounds to the mess hall, where some clearly deranged astronauts are throwing bricks of freeze-dried ice cream at each other. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
Hey! Turns out government-sanctioned bullying can be rather fun! Hovering over the yellow moon, {0.SimFirstName} blasts the volume on {M0.his}{F0.her} comm and demands to talk to the Rebel leader. A balding man in flowing robes emerges from a small hut and gazes up at {0.SimFirstName} fearfully.
Why not? That should get the government off {0.SimFirstName}'s back! Maybe this hot plate will do the trick? No...no, that just causes pain. Lots and lots of pain. What can {M0.he}{F0.she} do to deal with it?
Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} gives a vicious war cry, and a high-speed dogfight follows! {0.SimFirstName} emerges the fearless victor. Avoiding the time-edge this time around, {F0.she}{M0.he} can return home safely.
Really? Are you sure you--I mean, {0.SimFirstName} should erase all the data on yo--{M0.HIS}{F0.HER} computer? All data will be permanently deleted. Proceed?
{M0.He}{F0.She} unseals the air tank and peeks inside - there's nothing in it! Nothing at all! Suspicious! {M0.He}{F0.She} puts it in the air lock and jets it into space. A few minutes later {M0.he}{F0.she} sees an empty air tank float by {M0.his}{F0.her} window. How did that get there? Is someone following {0.SimPronounObjective}? Is that rogue tank a listening device?
{0.SimFirstName} gently and lovingly sprinkles water on the crop fields. The plants start growing strong and the aliens rejoice! Now they want more sunshine.
Someone picks up {0.SimFirstName}’s distress call and claims to be nearby. In minutes, a large, rundown-looking fighter emerges from the nebula’s glow. “Follow us, {M0.Bucko}{F0.Buttercup}!” a low, reptilian voice says over the comm. Does {0.SimFirstName} follow?
{0.SimFirstName} can't let the government see {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo, because then THEY'LL KNOW. But after jettisoning all the cargo, the ship is still too heavy! The only thing left is fuel and food, so {0.SimFirstName} starts eating all the astronaut food {M0.he}{F0.she} can.
{0.SimFirstName} gives them more food, more sunlight, and even starts giving some of the aliens rides from one end of the colony to another. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} basically become their slave, all just to get them to like {M0.him}{F0.her}. While they're sleeping, {0.SimFirstName} sneaks away to go home and meditate on the nature of co-dependency.
{M0.He}{F0.She} dismantles every non-essential part of the ship for extra sheet metal to cover the breach, but {0.SimFirstName} has seen better patches on pants. {0.SimFirstName}'s not even positive it will make re-entry into atmosphere! {M0.He}{F0.She} straps in for a bumpy landing.
{0.SimFirstName} pulls the toilet over to a sunnier part of the rest stop. Now the aliens have everything they could ever need. &quot;Our deity is so generous,&quot; cry the aliens. But now they're a little spoiled, and they start asking {0.SimFirstName} to smite their enemies.
Juvenile or not, {0.SimFirstName} knows it’s best not to cross a frightened alien. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} almost back to the Flea Market when the creature shows itself. It is a juvenile, whose big brother dared it to board {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy before arriving home. It will take off {0.SimFirstName}’s handcuffs if {M0.he}{F0.she} agrees....
Hoping {M0.his}{F0.her} allergies stay under control, {0.SimFirstName} lunges into the hissing mob and gropes about wildly. Pain shoots up {M0.his}{F0.her} arm as {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers close around a wriggling, velvety beast. Success! {M0.He}{F0.She} wrangles the animal into the ship and thrusts it into a iron cage. {0.SimFirstName} can’t wait to see what they’ll make of this back home…
Hmm, this is a little disturbing. {0.SimFirstName} thought that would help. The next symptom of Space Madness is paranoia and bad decision-making. Why didn't the fresh air tank help? It must have been a conspiracy!! {0.SimFirstName} needs to deal with this right now.
