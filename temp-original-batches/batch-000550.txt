An itchy burning sensation is irritating {0.SimFirstName} from underneath! 
Nearby Crying!
You...cry? Me cry too? &lt;b&gt;WE CRY&lt;/b&gt;?! WAAAH!!
Crying Infant
The world would be oh-so-much better if the crying would just stop!
Crying Baby
Yuck. {0.SimFirstName} thought toddlers were bad, but these infants are completely unmanageable. Could someone take this... thing... away?

Why Would You Put Me Here?
{0.SimFirstName} is sad from being put in some weird backpack thing! What's going on!?
Why Would You Hold Me?

Snuggled up, {0.SimFirstName} feels safe and sound from being held by a close Sim.
How Dare You Put Me Down!
The warmth and comfort is absent... and now it feels like the end of the world!
How Dare You Put Me Here!
Let me go!! {0.SimFirstName} is not enjoying this weird backpack thing. What kind of contraption is this?!
How Dare You Hold Me!
Maybe it's the Sim or just the situation that's bothering {0.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} is now infuriated from being held and wants to be put down!
Can't Reach!
Tragedy has struck! The thing {0.SimFirstName} really wants is just out of reach. How is {0.SimPronounSubjective} supposed to carry on without it?

So So Slee...py...
{0.SimFirstName} is incredibly tired, even if {0.SimPronounSubjective} doesn't show it in the same way as less-calm Infants. {0.SimPronounSubjective|xxUpper} needs to sleep right now.

Babies are so cute, but getting spit up on is gross. Yuck!
Craving New Flavors
Bleh! {0.SimFirstName} is tired of milk. Try exploring baby foods!
Were Those Fangs?!
Biting is a natural part of development, but were those fangs?! How strange.
Ouch!
Biting is a natural part of development, but who knew tiny teeth could be this sharp?
{0.SimFirstName} is receiving the bare minimum of care. That should be enough, right?
Needs Met
{0.SimFirstName} feels relatively cared for. There is always room for improvement though...
{0.SimFirstName} feels abandoned by {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} caregivers. Someone better tend to this helpless being's needs soon!
Needs Help

Listening to an uncomfortable joke can leave a Sim in an icky mood.
Broken Dreams
Feeling Festive
Takes the place of Moodlets when traits dictate the Moodlet should be blocked
Gift from Mother Nature
There's nothing better than hand-picked food!
Better than Expected!
Hey that was pretty good! Maybe I should eat &quot;out&quot; more often.
It's Just Ok
That definitely tasted &quot;natural.&quot; Could use some more flavor.
Happy by Potion
Mmm... Drinking that potion really makes a Sim feel content.
Joyful Mean-Spiritedness
Mean Sims delight in being nasty to others.
New Baby!
No moment in a Sim's life is more joyous than the birth of a child!
Out of this Life
When you're as old as Grim, it's only natural to pick up a few impressive tricks over time. {0.SimFirstName} had an experience that {0.SimPronounSubjective} will never forget!
Grim Satisfaction
Grim has got it goin' on! Who knew that an undead being from the afterlife could move like that?!
Deathly Performance
It was an interesting thought, but {0.SimFirstName} had not considered the &lt;i&gt;actual reality&lt;/i&gt; of WooHooing with Grim. Cold bony claws, the eerie sense of dread...
Brush with Death
Narrowly avoiding death would give any Sim an optimistic view on life!
