The Logic skill benefits Sims in some careers and in Interactions like Hacking via the computer.
Sims in the Focused emotion will generally find it easier to keep their mind logically focused.

Guitar Skill
Sims in the Inspired emotion will generally be better Guitarists.

Sims with a higher level Guitar skill will learn new, more challenging Songs, new musical interactions, and will be able to Write Songs.
Gardening Skill
There are several ways you can speed the evolution process of your plant. Fertilization is often the fastest method. You can Fertilize plants with almost anything--from fruits to fish. The more valuable your Fertilizer, the more of a boost your plant will get.
As you level your Gardening skill you will gain access to new gardening techniques such as fertilizing or splicing. All of which you can use to become the best agriculturalist you can be.
To have your Sim start gardening, you will need to acquire some seeds. Seeds can be purchased through Planter Boxes found in Build Mode or from a computer.\n\nPurchased seeds can be found in your Sim's inventory.
When you plant your first seed click on it to Water, Weed, or Spray for Insects. Your plant's visual state should provide information about what it needs. Your plant's happiness is determined by three factors: Infestation, Water, and Weeds.\n\nThe better you take care of your plant, the faster you can Evolve it.
Once you become skilled enough, you will be able to combine plants by taking a cutting from one plant and grafting it to another. Doing this will cause the plant to grow both crops from one plant. It may also create special seeds.
Having a high Gardening skill allows you to Evolve plants. There are five Evolutions in total, stage one being normal and stage five being perfect. The more evolved your plant, the more valuable their harvest will become.
Cooking Skill
Sims with the Focused emotion will generally prepare better food.
Higher quality kitchen appliances also lead to better quality food. 
Cooking improves your Sims' Cooking skill, unlocks new Recipes, and allows your Sims to prepare tastier, more fulfilling food.
Sims with a high Comedy skill will be able to Perform Routines at a Microphone to the delight (or annoyance) of other Sims.
Eventually, your comedic timing will increase to the point where you can start writing actual Comedy Routines at the computer.
The Comedy skill allows you to Write Jokes on the computer, laying the groundwork for becoming a hilarious comedian.

Controlling Sims
When you select something in an Interaction menu, it will appear in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Action Queue&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nIf you’re in a hurry (or changed your mind), you can click on any actions in the queue to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;cancel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Right-click&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on a Sim’s thumbnail to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;center the Game Camera&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on them.\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Home icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will appear when your Sim is away from their home lot. Clicking this will send them home.\n\nAn &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Away Action icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; appears on Sims who are not in the currently loaded Neighborhood. Clicking it will display different options for you to direct your Sim from afar. You can also choose to bring that Sim to you, or send yourself to that Sim through this menu.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Click&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the ground, an Object, or a Sim to reveal the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Interaction menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nHere you will find all the Interactions your controlled Sim has available with the thing you clicked on. More interactions can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unlocked&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with higher Relationship scores, Skill levels etc.
Sims will do things &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;on their own&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but why let them have all the fun? Shape your Sims’ lives by giving them some much needed &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;guidance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you can find a row of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;thumbnails&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, representing each Sim in your current household. This is where you select which Sim to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;control&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nYou can also use the [Spacebar] to change your active Sim.\n\nYour active Sim has a green, yellow, orange, or red crystal hovering above their head. That's the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plumbob&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Its color indicates the state of the Sim's Needs.
Sentiments
Sentiments are how a Sim feels about another Sim based on recent past experiences. There are Positive and Negative Sentiments, which can influence a Sim’s Mood and behavior when the other Sim is around! These are discovered naturally through gameplay and will fade over time. The amount of time it takes for a Sentiment to fade depends on if it is a Long-Term or Short-Term Sentiment. \n\nNew experiences together can also make existing Sentiments fade more quickly or more slowly. Positive Sentiments are easily eroded by very negative experiences, and a successful apology goes a long way towards healing any Negative Sentiments. The colored backdrop behind a Sentiment icon indicates how far it is along in the fading process.\n\nA Sim may have up to four Sentiments about another Sim at a time. If a Sim acquires more than four Sentiments about a particular Sim, the least important Sentiment will be replaced.
You can see which Sentiments your Sim has about another Sim while they are having a conversation by clicking the Sentiment icon on the Conversation Panel at the top center of the screen. This will reveal details on any acquired Sentiments with that Sim.
You can also see which Sentiments your Sim has about another Sim from the Sim's Profile, as well as the Sentiments that the other Sim has about your Sim. To view a Sim's Profile, click on the Relationships panel and find the desired Sim. Click on the Sim’s picture and choose “&lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;”. Sentiment information is located in the “Sentiments” dropdown.
If you complete a Scenario goal, your Sims will be rewarded with things like Traits, Potions, or even Satisfaction Points to use in the Rewards Store. \n\nThe Rewards Store can be accessed from a Sim's Aspiration Panel.\n \nThere are many ways to complete a Scenario, so try out new strategies and ways to play!
Romance
Different relationships offer different and interesting social possibilities available to your Sims. Begin exploring all the Romance options!
Successfully Romancing with a Sim improves the romantic aspect of their relationship.
A secondary relationship bar will appear to track your Romance. Your relationship with other Sims change as a result of both friendship and romance levels.
Relationships
The better the relationship, the more interesting the social possibilities available to your Sim!
Information a Sim learns about another Sim is stored within the &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sim's Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. This includes information on their current relationship.\n\nTo view a Sim's Profile, click on the &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relationships&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; panel and find the desired Sim. Click on the Sim’s picture and choose “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;”. Relationship information is located in the “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relationship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;” dropdown.\n\nYou also can open the Profile of another Sim by clicking on that Sim and choosing “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;” from the “&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Actions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;” category.
Socializing with other Sims is a great way to improve your Sim's Social Need.
Relationships between Sims of different ages will now face different advantages and challenges. Sims will gain or lose relationship at different speeds depending on both the types of interaction &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; the age of the other Sim.\n\nFor example, Child Sims will become friends much faster with other Child Sims, since they understand each other so well. But a Child Sim will find it a bit more difficult to raise their relationship with a Teen or Young Adult Sim, who might take the Child less seriously than their peers. Adult Sims will struggle to raise their relationship with Teen Sims, as Teens will often see them as uncool. But Adult Sims will have a much easier time befriending Elders.
Sims improve relationships when having positive social interactions with other Sims.
Fitness Skill
Athletic Sims lead healthier lives and will push back any excess weight gain from over-eating.
Sims in the Energized Emotion will generally exercise better.
Sims with higher Fitness Skill can Mentor and Train others of lower Fitness Skill.
Positive Emotions
Experiment with different activities to discover new positive Emotions. Be sure to inspect the Emotion's benefit by hovering over your Sims portrait in the HUD, to take full advantage of them.
Different positive Emotions convey different benefits. For example, Inspired sims are better at creative activities. 
New interactions become available and others disappear based on your Sims' emotions.
Positive emotions should be seen as an opportunity to accomplish great things. Experiment as your Sims navigate the emotional landscape.
Paying Bills
Additional Power or Water utility that the player generates for the week is detailed on the right side of this menu. These utilities are automatically set to Auto Sell and will deduct from the weekly bill when it arrives. Toggling them to Store will allow the player to accrue Power or Water until a cap is reached. Excess Power or Water utility may be sold at any time by pressing the Sell Now button.
As Sims buy more items and increase the value of their home, their bills will increase. Bills are primarily comprised of a tax on the lot’s value as well as the utility usage of objects in the form of Power and Water. 
Not paying bills will result in the possible loss of your utilities, such as Power and Water. If bills remain delinquent long enough the Repo Person will arrive and take objects to pay off any debts. 
Bills arrive in the mailbox. They can be paid via the computer, your phone, or on the mailbox.\n\nYou will get a notification reminder before your bills become late.
Click the “Show Bills Information” interaction on any mailbox to view additional information pertaining to Bills and Utilities. Hover over any line item title in the Current Billing Estimate section of the menu to learn what is affecting your upcoming bill. See the current estimate to the right.
Off-the-Grid
Family

When your Sims develop a romantic Relationship, you can eventually ask to become &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;romantic partners&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;propose&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can find these social interactions in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Romance category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nOnce engaged, two Sims can get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;married&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;elope&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; interaction or plan a wedding by using the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Plan a Social Event&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; option in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Cell Phone’s Social app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
There are two ways to have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;children&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Try for Baby&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Social interaction, or the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adoption service&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; found through Hire a Service in the Cell Phone’s Home app.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Try for Baby&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; becomes available once a Sim who can get pregnant and a Sim who can impregnate build a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;strong romantic Relationship&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adoption service&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is available for couples as well as singles.
Emotions
Taking care of your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and participating in activities associated with their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (such as reading books if you have the Bookworm Trait) are good ways to get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;positive Moodlets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;negative Moodlets go away&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; faster with some &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;self care&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Taking a shower, using the mirror for a pep talk or to calm down, or crying in bed may be helpful, depending on what Emotion your Sim is dealing with.
Sims are feeling creatures! Their current mood, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, has a big impact on what they do and how they do it. \n\nA &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;positive Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; may help your Sim to build &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, develop &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and get promoted in their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Negative Emotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, however, may cause your Sims to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;fail&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at things or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;stop&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them from doing those things altogether until they feel better.\n
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is based on their current &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Moodlets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nEach Moodlet has a different strength, duration, and associated Emotion. The main &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;source&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Moodlets are your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and recent &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;experiences&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nYou can see your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;current Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Moodlets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;portrait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Hover the cursor over the Sim or a Moodlet to learn more!
Aspirations
Hover the cursor over each &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Goal&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for more information. As your Sim completes these Goals, they will get &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Satisfaction Points&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that can be spent in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Reward Store&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is what they aspire to be, do, and experience! In &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, this is represented by the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration Goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. These can help you set the course of your Sim’s life!
Most &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have multiple &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, each with their own set of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. When all of them are completed, your Sim will get a powerful &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Reward Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nYou can see your current Stage and the Reward Trait by hovering the cursor over the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your current Aspiration, use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Select New Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.
Aging &amp; Death
Follow your Sims from the cradle to the grave. As time goes on, Sims will &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and go through seven &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Life Stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Baby&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Toddler&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Teenager&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Young Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Elder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nEach Life Stage offers unique &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;experiences&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;challenges&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Some Sims may have an &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;accident&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; before they reach the golden years of elderhood. \n\nBeware of fire, swimming while tired, and huge chunks of rock hurling towards you from the sky. Or you know, don’t, and see what happens!
You can modify the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lifespan&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Sims, and which Sims age and which don’t. Open the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and navigate to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gameplay&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tab.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Auto aging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is on by default for Played Sims. This includes your current &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;active Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and other &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Households&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you have &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;played&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; previously. \n\nIf you want your active Household to age, but not your other Households, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Only Active Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Auto Age (Played Households)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; setting.
Dying isn’t the end! When Sims meet their untimely (or timely) demise, a Sim can begin a new chapter by becoming a Ghost.\n\nBy choosing &lt;b&gt;Become a Playable Ghost&lt;/b&gt;, the Sim will remain in the Household and continue to be playable as a Ghostly presence.\nChoose &lt;b&gt;Become a Freeroaming Ghost&lt;/b&gt; if you would prefer this Sim &lt;i&gt;live on&lt;/i&gt; as a Ghost in an unplayed Household. These Sims will no longer be a played Sim but can still be found in the World.
Live Mode
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the game Mode in which your Sim, well, live! You can tell your Sims what to do in order to shape their lives, or see what they get up to on their own.\n\nThere’s a lot you can do in Live Mode, but to get you started, here are some basic tips: manage your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; so they can be their best selves, join a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to make some money, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;explore&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the world to meet other Sims and discover new activities!
Lessons
Lessons are divided into &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which each cover a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Game Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Pack&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Within Categories there are also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Subcategories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you can open to find even more Lessons. \n\nSelecting a Category or Subcategory gives you a short &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;overview&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of its content.
In the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Lessons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; library you’ll find information about everything from how to customize unique Sims and mastering the build tools to how you make your Sims rich and happy (or poor and miserable, if that’s your style.)\n\nCurrently, you’re in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Getting Started Category&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of Lessons. Here you can find all the basic knowledge you need to start playing.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the basics, feel free to browse through the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;other Categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for more in depth information and inspiration.
What Should I Do Next?
Some Sims want to be the best, maxing out as many &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Careers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as they can!\n\nA true &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;virtuoso&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; might work hard to climb the ranks of the Musician branch of the Entertainment Career while leveling every instrument Skill, while a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;foodie&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; dedicates themselves to the Cooking, Gourmet Cooking, and Mixology Skills as well as the Food Aspirations.\n\nMastering Skills is also a great way to make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; why not build your fortune creating &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;masterpieces&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the Painting Skill or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;hacking&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the Programming Skill?
Last but not least, let your creative juices flow in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Play around with the tools and explore the Object catalog to discover the depth of possibility this game mode has to offer.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Recreating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a building you’ve visited or lived in, or a floorplan you found online, can be a fun challenge. You could also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;research&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; different architectural and interior design styles, and create your own &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;interpretations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Leave reality behind&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and pull your inspiration from fairy tales and science fiction; who wouldn’t love to live in a giant mushroom or spaceship?
A popular playstyle among Simmers (Sims fans) is playing the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;same family, generation after generation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and growing an impressive family tree! \n\nHaving babies and nurturing them as they age up to Toddlers, Children, and Teenagers allows you to play with all the different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;life stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nDid you know the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fertile Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the Reward Store increases your chances of having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;twins and triplets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;?
In The Sims 4, only your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;imagination&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sets the limits! But sometimes, with near endless possibilities, it can be hard to know where to start. Let us offer some &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;suggestions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
The world is full of things to discover! &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Explore each Neighborhood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and experience what they have to offer. New places also offer new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Collectibles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; such as harvestable plants, fishes, fossils, and crystals.\n\nWhy not &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;show off your discoveries&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at home with shelves filled with fossils, aquariums with rare fish, or a flourishing garden with rare (perhaps even &lt;i&gt;supernatural&lt;/i&gt;) plants? \n\nSome &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;secrets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; exist outside the edges of the World Map. If you were to encounter a strange tree or an old mine entrance, perhaps you should take a closer look… 
Why not experiment with how Sims &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;interact&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and what impact different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Social Interactions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have on their relationships? Become the life of the party, an irresistible heartbreaker, or spread chaos wherever you go! \n\nTry one of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Love&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Popularity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Deviance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; categories for some inspiration, or work on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Charisma&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Comedy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Mischief&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Skill to unlock unique interactions.\n\nSims who reach Mischief level 3 can buy a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;voodoo doll&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; via a computer. Better stay on their good side…
Explore every facet of &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Create a Sim&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and see how far you can push the customization tools! Why not try to create yourself, a friend, a fairytale character, or a celebrity?\n\nWhat kind of character would make for a great &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;friend&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;enemy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;love interest&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for your Sim? Create them, add them to your world, and see what happens!\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Media tropes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be a great source of inspiration. Who is your version of the gold digger, the nosy neighbor, the hopeless romantic, the secretive hacker, or the evil genius?
