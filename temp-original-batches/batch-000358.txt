Phew! {0.SimFirstName} feels so much better with a few SugarBops in {M0.his}{F0.her} tummy, and the teacher didn’t even notice. {M0.He}{F0.She} even snuck a few to {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor, who traded a cool sticker for them.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t get all the words right, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does get a few letters right in each word! Besides, {M0.he}{F0.she} gave it {M0.his}{F0.her} best effort, and that’s what counts the most, right?
{0.SimFirstName} stuffs the cookie into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth, hurriedly brushing away crumbs. Chocolate chip—awesome! {M0.He}{F0.She} is so energetic in class afterwards that {M0.he}{F0.she} even earns a star for enthusiasm.
Who needs a friend like that anyway? {0.SimFirstName} tunes it out and plays with the new {M0.boy}{F0.girl} at recess. Later, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds the invite in {M0.his}{F0.her} cubby, buried under a stale bag of pretzels. Oops!
{0.SimFirstName} tries to shuffle over to the hooks where {M0.he}{F0.she} keeps a {M0. sweatshirt}{F0. sweater}, but before {M0.he}{F0.she} can tie it around {M0.his}{F0.her} waist, an older kid shouts, “EWW! That kid wet {M0.his}{F0.her} pants!” Everyone stares. {0.SimFirstName} borrows pants from Lost &amp; Found to wear for the rest of the day.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to take pride in {M0.his}{F0.her} work and not risk getting a late mark. Brandishing {M0.his}{F0.her} poster, {M0.he}{F0.she} turns it in, earning a flaccid smile from the teacher and a bright red B.
{0.SimFirstName} thinks hard—where would {M0.he}{F0.she} go if {M0.he}{F0.she} were a tiny, fluffy critter often surrounded by screaming children? Up on the shelves? Behind the toilet? Inside Mr. Bones? By the time the teacher comes in, the lab is a mess and Fluffy’s still missing.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher sees {0.SimPronounObjective} doodling and comes over to check {M0.his}{F0.her} work. Frowning, she picks up the paper, circles 5 spelling errors and insists that {0.SimFirstName} use the remaining time to do it all over again.
Pretending to concentrate, {0.SimFirstName} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes and recites the letters the girl showed him. “Incorrect,” snaps the proctor. {0.SimFirstName} loses! The brainiac falls off her chair laughing, along with half the room. It was a mean trick!
Sometimes adults are smarter than they look. {0.SimFirstName} shuffles to the front and asks to go see the school nurse. The teacher says {M0.he}{F0.she} can go...right after the test!
{0.SimFirstName} nudges {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor with an elbow, and the kid makes his way to the stage. The poor kid is given cymbals and asked to “improvise.” What follows is a noisy, embarrassing mess that will stay with the boy for years. Yikes!
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} manages to unzip {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack just enough to get a good look at the words. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t get all the words right, since they are still covered in doodles, but then getting a perfect score would make {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher suspicious.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to quell {M0.his}{F0.her} anxiety by taking big, deep breaths, and what do you know, it works! Sure, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates shoot {0.SimPronounObjective} some funny looks, but when you’re an A student you have to take every test seriously!
{0.SimFirstName} sits back while the other kid takes the stage. The kid looks pretty embarrassed as he’s asked to “improvise” something on bongos. But before {0.SimFirstName} can laugh, the music teacher calls {M0.him}{F0.her} up to play back-up on rainstick. That’s not even a real instrument!
{0.SimFirstName} stashes {M0.his}{F0.her} poster in the hall. Later, at recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} goes to recover it and cover it with silvery marker swirls, only to find it gone! Someone threw it out! Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to start all over AND take a late grade!
Yep, Ballistic Watermelon—yum! {0.SimFirstName} chews happily through the rest of the class, feeling pleased if a little queasy.
{0.SimFirstName} slides quickly under the bleachers, wedging {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into a nice shady spot. Unfortunately, lying down in the shade is a little too restful. When {0.SimFirstName} awakes, Coach is glaring down at {0.SimPronounObjective}. Now everyone has to watch {0.SimFirstName} finish {M0.his}{F0.her} laps!
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is not pleased at all with {M0.his}{F0.her} timely achievement. Frowning, she picks up the paper, circles 5 spelling errors and insists that {M0.he}{F0.she} use the remaining time to do it all over again.
This is {0.SimFirstName}’s chance to show off {M0.his}{F0.her} talents! Up to the front {M0.he}{F0.she} goes, where the teacher hands {0.SimPronounObjective} some cymbals. Crash-bang! This is one performance no one will forget, not for a long time.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to wait it out and see if anyone comes forward. Sure enough at lunch some friends laugh and wave to {M0.him}{F0.her}. “Hey, Cutie!” one taunts. {0.SimFirstName} wads up the note and tosses it at them, laughing along with the joke. Someday it’ll happen for real, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} relieved it’s not today.
Oops. Turns out the party wasn’t even for {0.SimFirstName}’s friend—it was only a show on TV! {0.SimFirstName} feels a little silly, but very glad {M0.he}{F0.she} asked.
The mean kid swipes {0.SimFirstName}’s brownie, just as expected. But what the bully WON’T be expecting is a brownie full of laxatives! Unfortunately, before {0.SimFirstName} can enjoy a self-satisfied chuckle, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the mean kid offer the brownie to the principal in an effort to suck up! Oh no!!
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t think {M0.his}{F0.her} answer is all that funny, but for some reason, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are falling off their seats laughing. Wow! Great crowd! {0.SimFirstName} has definitely got this.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is busy writing on the board. Shuffling the top paper under {M0.his}{F0.her} shirt, {0.SimFirstName} excuses {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to the bathroom. Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} is followed by the owner of the paper, who takes {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch in exchange for silence.
{0.SimFirstName} hides the plane in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack until recess. By the time {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to the playground, the nose is bent and the thing won’t fly straight. Back to the drawing board…
Phew! {0.SimFirstName} tells the teacher what happened, and the teacher helps {0.SimPronounObjective} transfer {M0.his}{F0.her} answers onto a new form. Just enough time to finish the rest of the test!
Yes! {0.SimFirstName}’s plane does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing on the substitute’s desk. Amazingly, the sub still doesn’t see it, but {0.SimFirstName} scores points with {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, who do.
{0.SimFirstName} glances around and decides it’s too risky. But imagining that cool shade helps {0.SimPronounObjective} pick up a little speed! {0.SimFirstName} finishes all {M0.his}{F0.her} laps with a new personal best time!
{0.SimFirstName} jumps off the bench, shouting, “Gross! What WAS that?” {M0.His}{F0.Her} friends laugh, but “with” {0.SimPronounObjective} more than “at” {0.SimPronounObjective}. Phew!
{0.SimFirstName} runs into the hall, shouting, “Fluffy is loose! Fluffy is loose!” Soon the lab is packed with kids on a rescue mission, and the gerbil is recovered in no time. With all the commotion, no one thinks to ask how he escaped, and {0.SimFirstName} decides it can stay between {M0.him}{F0.her} and Fluffy, this time.
Up to the front {0.SimFirstName} goes, where the teacher hands {M0.him}{F0.her} some cymbals. Crash-bang! {M0.He}{F0.She} makes so much noise {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t even notice the teacher’s cries for {M0.him}{F0.her} to stop—not until the principal snatches the cymbals away. Oops.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is very pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} focus and effort. After all, {M0.he}{F0.she} rarely finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} assignments at all, so why would the teacher expect pictures? {0.SimFirstName} even gets the coveted gold star!
Lunch is almost over when the class bully notices the bib on the floor. He can’t wait to find the “little baby” who dropped it, but the new kid says nothing and neither does {0.SimFirstName}, who may have just made a new friend.
{0.SimFirstName} places {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe over the bib and grabs it when {M0.he}{F0.she} thinks no one is looking. Unfortunately, the class bully IS looking and immediately starts calling {0.SimPronounObjective} a little baby. Little help here, new kid? No??
Well, this time at least, being honest doesn’t pay. {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher makes {0.SimPronounObjective} help out the nurse while {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates go on the trip.
Well, that didn’t go well. {0.SimFirstName} only got a shrug for an answer, and now {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is actively avoiding {0.SimPronounObjective}. Oh well, who needs a friend like that anyway? *sigh*
The girl seems happy enough and {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t really know her. Unfortunately, some older kids notice, too, and they start pointing and laughing loudly. The girl cries. {0.SimFirstName} can’t help but feel that all of this could have been avoided.
To take {M0.his}{F0.her} mind off lunch, {0.SimFirstName} actually pays attention to the lesson. Wow, how cool—{0.SimFirstName} is really and truly learning something today!
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is very pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} extra effort. Of course, {0.SimFirstName} could have spent the time checking {M0.his}{F0.her} work for spelling errors, but baby steps are fine for now. {0.SimFirstName} gets a gold star!
{0.SimFirstName} shrugs. Squirms. Then tells the truth. “I’m smart?” {M0.He}{F0.She} wasn’t trying to be funny, but the laughter feels friendly enough. One question down, 22 more to go! {0.SimFirstName} has definitely got this.
Even if the girl IS trying to copy, she’ll never admit it. When {0.SimFirstName} accuses her of cheating, those sweet, innocent eyes fill with tears and now everyone thinks {0.SimFirstName} is mean. Rats!
No one ever looks closely at these things, and no one can read {0.SimFirstName}’s mom’s writing anyways. {M0.He}{F0.She} signs it quickly under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and passes it in with a smile.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is busy writing on the board. Shuffling the top paper under {M0.his}{F0.her} shirt, {0.SimFirstName} excuses {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to the bathroom. A few minutes and several word changes later, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s got a pretty convincing copy in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack. Nice!
{0.SimFirstName} waits until the cafeteria monitor is near, then shouts for the mean kid to unhand {M0.his}{F0.her} food. The monitor quickly walks over and simply shushes {0.SimFirstName} AND the mean kid. Is this justice?? It’s almost like the cafeteria monitor doesn’t take her job seriously!
{0.SimFirstName} thinks hard—where would {M0.he}{F0.she} go if {M0.he}{F0.she} were a tiny, fluffy critter often surrounded by screaming children? Sure enough, Fluffy has squeezed himself behind the spooky science jars, hoping the floating specimens will scare off pursuers. Nice try, Fluffy! Never underestimate {0.SimFirstName} when trouble is on the line.
Caught with marker still on his hands, {0.SimFirstName}’s harasser is sent to the principal and worse, home to his furious mom. Unfortunately, being a tattletale is not exactly a boost to {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation. And grade schoolers have looooong memories...
Smart move. {0.SimFirstName} knows not to trust hyper-competitive smart kids. {M0.He}{F0.She} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, blocks out the notebook, and guesses each letter slowly. Correct! {0.SimFirstName} is the surprise winner! 
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher commends {0.SimPronounObjective} for {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and gives {0.SimPronounObjective} a one-time extension. {M0.He}{F0.She} has a lot to get done in a short time, but at least {M0.he}{F0.she} got a second chance!
{0.SimFirstName} knows better than to chew someone else’s gum, especially with all the flu bugs going around. {M0.He}{F0.She} gives it to a classmate instead, who is super happy to have it.
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher commends {0.SimPronounObjective} for {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and marks an F next to {M0.his}{F0.her} name. “Next time, you won’t forget,” she smiles. 
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t afraid of what other kids think. {M0.He}{F0.She} and {M0.what’s-his-name}{F0. what’s-her-name} have a lot of fun, at least until the {M0.boy}{F0.girl} calls {M0.him}{F0.her} Stupid. Hey, no fair! Nerds aren’t supposed to be bullies!
{0.SimFirstName} is just shoving the cookie into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth when a loudmouth kid accuses {0.SimPronounObjective} of sneaking food. {0.SimFirstName}’s mouth is way too full to answer. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s only in mild trouble, but sooner or later someone will look for that cookie...
The new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} is alone, since {M0.she}{F0.he} doesn’t have many friends yet. But when {0.SimFirstName} presents the note, the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} misunderstands. “Umm…I don’t even know you.” Worse, the class gossip comes around the corner and spies them together. However bad this feels now, it’ll be much worse soon…
OK, maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have snuck something quieter. {M0.He}{F0.She} only has the wrapper halfway open when the teacher takes {M0.his}{F0.her} SugarBops and sends {0.SimPronounObjective} to the principal, grumbly stomach and all.
{0.SimFirstName} walks over and taps the girl on the shoulder, then whispers into her ear. Blushing, the girl mumbles something and runs off to the girls’ room, one of her friends following. 
{0.SimFirstName} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes trained dutifully on the board, hoping the kid will stop. Instead, the kid fires a ball of paper so hard it rolls up to the teacher’s feet. For once, somebody else gets in trouble, and {0.SimFirstName} gets to look innocent and studious!
{0.SimFirstName} manages to unzip {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack just enough to get a good look at the words. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s almost done with the quiz when Smarty Marty sees and tattles on {0.SimPronounObjective}. Off {0.SimFirstName} goes to the principal, with another big fat F!
Yep, Ballistic Watermelon—yum! {0.SimFirstName} is chewing happily when {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher stops and asks what’s in {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. {0.SimFirstName} isn’t sure which will be worse—cleaning desks at recess or the tummy-ache that’s coming on.
When {0.SimFirstName} is done with {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch, {M0.he}{F0.she} ties a {M0.sweatshirt}{F0.sweater} around {M0.his}{F0.her} waist and goes off to play. {M0.His}{F0.Her} bottom feels clammy and gross, but it’ll dry soon…{M0.he}{F0.she} hopes.
No one ever looks closely at these things, right? {0.SimFirstName} signs it quickly under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and passes it in with a smile. Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she} forgets to sign {M0.his}{F0.her} parent’s name instead of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, and spends the day in the principal’s office instead.
{0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} can do this on {M0.his}{F0.her} own. {M0.He}{F0.She} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, blocks out the notebook, and guesses each letter slowly. Incorrect! The brainiac falls off her chair laughing. Still, better to lose honestly, right?
{0.SimFirstName} dusts off the cookie and places it back in the open bag, but not without checking who owns it. {M0.He}{F0.She} is happy about doing the right thing, but the kid should also know they owe {M0.him}{F0.her} one.
{0.SimFirstName}’s finely honed intelligence isn’t just good for tests. It’s great for outsmarting adults! Sniffling and quivering, {M0.he}{F0.she} shuffles to the front and asks to go see the school nurse. Yes! No test today…just a nice soft cot and the sweet smell of adhesive bandages.
{0.SimFirstName} tries to make a joke out of it—something about alphabets and there’s nothing before the A—but when every kid stays silent, {M0.he}{F0.she} opts for silence, too. One question down, only 22 to go…This is going to be {M0.his}{F0.her} longest class ever.
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t afraid of what other kids think. {M0.He}{F0.She} and {M0.what’s-his-name}{F0.what’s-her-name} have a lot of fun. {M0.He}{F0.She} even offers to help {0.SimFirstName} with homework during free time!
Yes! {0.SimFirstName}’s plane does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing on the substitute’s desk. Unfortunately, the sub is watching closer than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. Crumpling up the plane, he sends {0.SimFirstName} to the principal.
Well, this time at least, being honest pays off. {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher simply calls {M0.his}{F0.her} parents and gets permission. Botanical Gardens, here {M0.he}{F0.she} comes!
{0.SimFirstName} stashes {M0.his}{F0.her} poster in the hall. Sneaking a silver pen from the art supplies {M0.he}{F0.she} covers the poster in shiny swirls and fish during recess. The teacher oohs and aahs over the improved poster, giving {0.SimFirstName} extra stars for the effort!
It’s pretty easy for {0.SimFirstName} to get the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} alone, since {M0.she}{F0.he} doesn’t have many friends yet. And {M0.she}{F0.he} definitely wrote it since {M0.she}{F0.he} blushes from {M0.her bangs}{F0.his head} to {M0.her toes}{F0.his high-tops}. So…now what? {0.SimFirstName} mumbles a sheepish thanks, keeping it a secret for now.
The mean kid swipes {0.SimFirstName}’s brownie, as expected. But today will be different. Yes...today will be different. {0.SimFirstName} idly wonders if the mean kid has ever even heard of the word “laxative.”
{0.SimFirstName}’s stomach growls so loudly that perfect little Susie shushes {M0.him}{F0.her}. The teacher hears and sends them both to the principal’s office, where they have to wait all the way through lunch.
The great thing about stupid people is they never cover their tracks. Spying red marker all over {M0.his}{F0.her} harasser’s hands, {0.SimFirstName} peels off the sign and gives the bully a friendly pat, transferring the sign and the torment.
Pretending to concentrate, {0.SimFirstName} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes and recites the letters from the girl’s notebook. It’s correct! {0.SimFirstName} is the surprise winner! {M0.He}{F0.She} feels a little guilty, but basks in {M0.his}{F0.her} 5 seconds of academic fame.
Poster Improvement
{0.SimFirstName} is super excited to turn in {M0.his}{F0.her} dolphin poster. Illustrations, photos, “Fun Facts,” it has it all! But all the kids are crowding around another kid’s poster, which shimmers with silvery detail. {0.SimFirstName} could say {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent} and then add more stuff at recess…
Exchanging Secret {1.String} Cards
For {1.String}, {0.SimFirstName} decided to handcraft a card for their crush-complete with pipe-cleaner hearts, glitter flowers, and dinosaurs! Because who doesn’t love dinosaurs?!\n\n{0.SimFirstName} just needed to decide if {M0.he}{F0.she} should ‘let it slip’ that it was {M0.him}{F0.her} who made the card or secretly drop it in their cubby.
Honor Roll Bully
Now that {0.SimFirstName}’s on the honor roll, {M0.he}{F0.she} may as well have a sign on {M0.his}{F0.her} back that says, “Kick Me.” Oh wait, {M0.he}{F0.she} does! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} tell the teacher, or try to find the culprit on {M0.his}{F0.her} own?
Spelling Bee Aid
It’s the school Spelling Bee and {0.SimFirstName} has made it to the final round! But this time, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s never even heard of the word {M0.he}{F0.she}’s supposed to spell. Glancing around the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees the class brainiac flash {0.SimPronounObjective} her notebook, with a word written neatly on it. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} accept the help, or give it {M0.his}{F0.her} best guess?
Sick with Worry
It’s test day and {0.SimFirstName} is so nervous, {M0.he}{F0.she} totally blanks! Even copying {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor won’t work because {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor is a D student! What to do…feign illness? Or just take deep breaths?
Pop Quiz
Pop quiz! {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} should have studied {M0.his}{F0.her} spelling list, but it was hard to actually read it under the supercool doodles {M0.he}{F0.she} made. {0.SimFirstName} can just do {M0.his}{F0.her} best, like {M0.his}{F0.her} parents always say, or see if the list is in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack…
Lunchtime Woes
{0.SimFirstName} plops down on the bench for lunch and knows right away that {M0.he}{F0.she} sat in something. Eww! Now everyone’s going to think {M0.he}{F0.she} wet {M0.his}{F0.her} pants. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} make a scene so people know the truth, or just hope that no one notices?
Fluffy's Escape
{0.SimFirstName} volunteers to help the science teacher clean the gerbil’s cage. The teacher has stepped out to talk to a parent, but {M0.he}{F0.she} already knows what to do—{M0.he}{F0.she} opens the cage, dumps the old stuff, and puts fresh stuff in. Fluffy will be so happy with... Uhh … Fluffy?!
Used Gum
{0.SimFirstName} is feeling B-O-R-E-D when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices something squishy stuck to the bottom of {M0.his}{F0.her} desk. Gum? Who put that there? Sneaking a peek, {0.SimFirstName} sees that’s neon green—the exact color of {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite ZumGum flavor.
Finished Early
Wow! {0.SimFirstName} is actually the very first student to finish {M0.his}{F0.her} writing assignment. {M0.He}{F0.She} starts to raise {M0.his}{F0.her} hand to show the teacher, but reconsiders. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can score extra points if {M0.he}{F0.she} draws a picture to go with it?
Payback Scheme
For a week now, a kid has been taking {0.SimFirstName}’s chips, and today he took {M0.his}{F0.her} brownie, too! It’s time for {0.SimFirstName} to take a stand. The way {M0.he}{F0.she} sees it there are two choices in Kid Law: public shaming or private revenge.
Potential Cheater
It isn’t easy earning top grades, and {0.SimFirstName} is feeling the pressure now. It doesn’t help that one of the girls keeps sitting close, glancing her way with her sweet, innocent eyes. Is she trying to be friendly, or just copy off {0.SimFirstName}? What to do?
Musical Volunteering
{0.SimFirstName} is sitting with {M0.his}{F0.her} class in assembly when the music teacher asks for a volunteer. The teacher is looking right at {0.SimPronounObjective}, but {0.SimFirstName} can see how excited the kid next to {0.SimPronounObjective} is to go up on stage. Should {0.SimFirstName} take the chance, or send the other kid?
Airplane Origami
