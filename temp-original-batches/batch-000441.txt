Sims can earn Mastery Perks when using skills at high levels. With their life experience, elders are more likely to discover them; however, any Sim can get a perk with persistent practice. Receiving mentoring and attending Hobby Classes helps as well.\n\nFor a more direct approach, elders can Bestow their perks upon other Sims. Mastery Perk Bestower and Remover Potions can also be purchased in the Reward Store.
