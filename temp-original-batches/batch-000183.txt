{0.SimFirstName} explains that phonebooks aren’t {M0.his}{F0.her} specialty, and offers to sign the book instead.  The boy is disappointed, but still happy to have talked to their idol.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath, and wrenches the phonebook.  Miraculously, it tears cleanly down the middle!  What strength!  The boy is ecstatic!
{0.SimFirstName} tries their hardest, but they can’t pull off the trick!  The boy looks on in shocked disbelief at their failing hero. Something was torn up that day, and that was a young boy’s dream…
There’s no need to turn themselves into spectacle, or worse, to get hurt! {0.SimFirstName} removes some weight and continues {M0.his}{F0.her} routine; the personal best can wait for another day.
{0.SimFirstName} grunts, groans, and with a mighty bellow, hoists the barbell up!! {0.SimFirstName} may have made a spectacle of {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, but anyone that turned to look was impressed by the sight of {M0.him}{F0.her} lifting an incredible amount of weight!
{0.SimFirstName} lets out a grunt, then a screech, and then an echoing guttural snarl, which causes the entire gym to stop and stare.  Unfortunately, these noises did not help with the lifting whatsoever, leaving {0.SimFirstName} hunched over and embarrassed.
Some extra money would have been nice, but {0.SimFirstName} only wants to endorse things they know well. {M0.His}{F0.Her} conviction doesn’t go unnoticed.
{0.SimFirstName} gets a hefty check out of the endorsement deal.  However, when word gets out that the product is nothing more than talcum powder and vanilla extract, {M0.he}{F0.she} loses some respect amongst {M0.his}{F0.her} peers.
{0.SimFirstName}’s routine is flawless, if predictable, earning {M0.him}{F0.her} a second place finish. Not bad!
{0.SimFirstName}’s strength and impeccable body awareness allows them to match the flex, and the routine finished flawlessly!  First Prize!
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t quite sure how it happened, but {M0.he}{F0.she} ended up with their arms tied in a tidy knot around their left shin.  The judges are concerned, but not impressed.
{0.SimFirstName}, a professional lifter, easily bests the cocky hobbyist. Still, deadlifting that much wasn't supposed to be part of today’s routine. {0.SimFirstName} feels sore.
There’s no need to humor this amateur.  {0.SimFirstName} is above such childishness!
After a precarious bobble, the Sim gets the bar under control and completes the set. However, {0.SimFirstName}’s boss questions {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to let someone lift so much without a spotter! 
{0.SimFirstName} rushes to help, but the lifter is very aggravated at being interrupted and yells at {0.SimFirstName}.  However, {0.SimFirstName}’s boss steps in and reminds the Sim that it’s NEVER a good idea to lift without a spotter.
{0.SimFirstName} gives them the benefit of the doubt this time, but if it happens again...
{0.SimFirstName} strides up to the perspirer and asks them to clean up their mess.  They are apologetic and quickly rectify the situation with a towel and some sanitizer.
The sweater denies any and all wrong doing, and lodges a complaint. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't get in any real trouble, but dealing with  paperwork causes them to fall behind in their efforts.
It was probably too heavy, but now {0.SimFirstName} will never know for sure.
{0.SimFirstName} lifts the heavy thing! Radical!
{0.SimFirstName} can’t lift the heavy thing! It’s too heavy! How disappointing.
{0.SimFirstName} readies all {M0.his}{F0.her} might before diving directly at Tiny. Tiny swiftly steps to the side, laughing as {0.SimFirstName} makes painful contact with the ground. Tiny takes hold of the shake and proceeds to drink it slowly. Never breaking eye contact with {0.SimFirstName} until the very last drop.
{0.SimFirstName} gets the jump. Deftly shoving Tiny aside before rushing to the bench. {0.SimFirstName} jumps onto the bench and bellows in glory before downing the shake in victory.
{0.SimFirstName} leaps into action, promptly stepping on Tiny's foot and causing both athletes to hit the ground face first. From their new vantage point, the pair watches as the rookie strolls slowly up to the bench and grabs the shake.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to stay out of it. If someone wants to try to play on a hurt leg, that’s their prerogative.
{0.SimFirstName} explains the situation, and the trainer orders some tests. The player had a partially torn ligament, and {0.SimFirstName} may have saved someone a potentially career ending injury!
{0.SimFirstName} explains the situation, and the trainer orders some tests. The player has to miss the big game to be tested, and the team loses in an embarrassing blowout!  
{0.SimFirstName} quickly gathers {M0.his}{F0.her} things and heads out. Coach probably wanted to be left alone anyway. Despite being delicious, the meal is rather uneventful.
{0.SimFirstName} bursts into a crazed gorilla impression, beating {M0.his}{F0.her} chest and ook-ing loudly. After a moment of stunned silence, Coach erupts into laughter at the sheer absurdity of the situation. {0.SimFirstName} asks Coach to join for dinner and he happily accepts.
{0.SimFirstName} approaches the office and starts firing off one-liners at Coach so fast he can barely react. Coach blinks a few times before quietly asking {0.SimFirstName} to leave him alone and then shuts the door.
{0.SimFirstName} walks in and stands defiantly next to the rookie. Not a good call. Looks like the rookie played a prank on the coaching staff and now Coach thinks that {0.SimFirstName} was in on it!
{0.SimFirstName} slowly backs away. The rookie's a talented player, but {0.SimFirstName} has no idea what they might be in trouble for. Better safe than sorry.
The fans get ready, anticipating some major moves after that big play... and are met by boring mediocrity. An awkward silence hangs in the air as the moment passes.
A big play deserves a big celebration! {0.SimFirstName} delivers and the crowd goes wild! {0.SimFirstName} is making sure {M0.his}{F0.her} teammates and coaches know who the big Sim on campus is.
Up. Over. Under. Left. Right. Down...on the ground. Probably should have practiced the routine at least once first!
{0.SimFirstName} is distracted by {M0.his}{F0.her} uniform for the whole game, especially on the 3 or 4 occasions {M0.his}{F0.her} pants fall down. {0.SimFirstName} has an ineffective performance.
The league fines {0.SimFirstName} for a non-compliant uniform, but {M0.he}{F0.she} is feeling so comfortable that {M0.he}{F0.she} has the game of {M0.his}{F0.her} life!
Sure, the financial reward isn’t there, but {0.SimFirstName} decides to do what is best for their sport.
Though some of {0.SimFirstName}’s teammates disagree with the decision, {0.SimFirstName} decides if you’re going to do a commercial, you might as well get paid for it!
The front office realizes {0.SimFirstName} can’t be undersold, and offers a sizable signing bonus!
The front office refuses to budge, and questions how much of a team player {0.SimFirstName} really is…
{0.SimFirstName} decides the current pay is fine, and recommits to the same structured deal as before.
“{0.SimFirstName} takes the safe route and ties the game up as time expires.  A conservative play for sure,  as it really looked like they could have stepped up and won it!”
“The kick is up…  looks a bit wobbly! But it’s off the backboard, squeaks just through the uprights, and it’s into the pool! {M0.he}{F0.she}’s done it! Amazing shot by {0.SimFirstName}!”
“The kick is up… looks a bit wobbly! It’s hooking far, far off of the fairway and headed towards the penalty box. No good! An audacious effort by {0.SimFirstName} loses the game!”
The coach rattles off the usual litany of clichés and idioms. It isn't very effective this time.
Ever charismatic, {0.SimFirstName} ad-libs an inspiring speech rivaling the works of Shakespeare… minus the tragedy. The team rallies and wins! 
{0.SimFirstName} fumbles through words, strained metaphors, and a weird tangent about cake that seemed relevant at the time.  The team is even more befuddled than before.
Cheating is never a good idea. {0.SimFirstName} takes the high road and leaves the book where it is.
{0.SimFirstName} now knows everything that will be coming their way!  With this advantage, they lead their team to victory.  All’s fair in love and sports.
{0.SimFirstName} now knows everything that will be coming their way… or so they think. The other team runs none of the plays from the book, and outsmarts {0.SimFirstName}'s team repeatedly. The book must have been a dummy!
{0.SimFirstName} slogs through the game, but never quite feels like {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. All in all, it’s a pretty mediocre effort.
The Trainer says it’s just tightness and provides a deep-tissue massage. {0.SimFirstName} feels great and has a spectacular performance in a winning effort!
The Trainer feels playing the game would be a poor choice, and makes {0.SimFirstName} sit.  The team loses.  Still, better than suffering a worse injury!
{0.SimFirstName} has been sent to daycare.

I'm pretty happy. I was recently nominated employee of the month!
I can't wait for my next promotion. That comes with &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; scythes!
I sure do enjoy the grim prospects.
I like it a lot here. The benefits are killer!
Let me know if you're interested in our customer referral program.
Ah, I'm busy to no end. With all these pools being built, I've been drowning in paperwork.
What? I'm the Grim Reaper!
It's going so-so. My customer fidelity program isn't really taking off.
Are you at all interested in my 2-for-1 deal?
I hate carrots. Don't ever talk to me about carrots. But I do love my job.
My employee badge picture is very unflattering. I'll have to have a new one taken.
You'll find out soon enough.
Oh, you'll find out soon enough-- wait! I've said too much.
My job requires a lot of traveling, but getting through airport security is getting increasingly more annoying.
I can't remember the last time I had some time off. People can be so self-centered sometimes.
This is really more of a hobby. Most of the time, you'll find me on the forums.
You know what they say: if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. Or after-life.
I wish we had Casual Fridays. My jeans are gathering quite a bit of dust.
