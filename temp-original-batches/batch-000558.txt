{0.SimFirstName} decided to keep the flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}! While at recess, another kid spotted them and offered to trade for some real flowers. Considering it an upgrade, {0.SimFirstName} accepted. {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} started the day with nothing, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} had a bouquet of real flowers. What an enterprising young sim!
{0.SimFirstName} mulled over who to give {M0.his}{F0.her} tissue-paper flowers to, but the answer was easy! {M0.Himself}{F0.Herself}! {0.SimFirstName} strutted off, flowers in hand-that was, until the wind plucked them free and stole them! The bright flowers drifted in the wind’s current until they were little specks on the horizon, never to be seen again…
After school, {0.SimFirstName} spotted a sad girl sitting on a bench. {M0.He}{F0.She} walked over and extended the bouquet of tissue paper flowers. Upon seeing the gift, her face lit up, and she gave {0.SimFirstName} the biggest hug ever! The teacher was right—It was so rewarding to make someone else’s {1.String} special.
{0.SimFirstName} passed by {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher, a sad little girl, and the school bully. Nothing felt “good enough” until {M0.he}{F0.she} spotted an old man, alone in the park. {M0.He}{F0.She} reached into {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack only to find that the bouquet of tissue paper flowers had been utterly demolished by {M0.his}{F0.her} homework while walking… There was probably a lesson to be learned here.
{0.SimFirstName}’s crush didn’t even know {M0.he}{F0.she} existed. This was an opportunity! In the heat of the moment, {0.SimFirstName} walked past the cubby and delivered the card directly into the hands of the most popular kid in school. After having it declared “the most awesome card ever,” {0.SimFirstName} was invited to hang out with the popular kids at recess and lunch whenever {M0.he}{F0.she} wanted! Doesn’t that make {0.SimFirstName} a popular kid too?
{0.SimFirstName}’s crush didn’t even know {M0.he}{F0.she} existed. This was an opportunity to change that! {0.SimFirstName} bypassed the cubby in favor of a hand-delivery. Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she}  wasn’t able to find {M0.his}{F0.her} crush on the playground. By the time {0.SimFirstName} gave up and returned to the cubby, {F0.her}{M0.his} crush’s bookbag was gone and the entire opportunity had been lost.
{0.SimFirstName} secretly dropped {M0.his}{F0.her} card in the cubby. When the other kids came in from recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} watched from across the room as {M0.his}{F0.her} card was opened. Glitter spilled out from the envelope, but it was surpassed in brightness by {M0.his}{F0.her} crush’s smile. Though {M0.his}{F0.her} involvement remained a secret, {0.SimFirstName} went the rest of {F0.her}{M0.his} day with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
{0.SimFirstName} secretly dropped {M0.his}{F0.her} card in the cubby. When {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates came in from recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} waited as {M0.his}{F0.her} crush put their coat away. Unfortunately, the {1.String} card had slipped between the cracks and was never found.
