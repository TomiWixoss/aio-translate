A float lounger in the water is so innocuously innocent until... SPLASH! Tidal wave! {0.SimFirstName} is so funny.
Super Splashed!
Well, {0.SimFirstName} was just swimming. Having a good time. When someone floated up behind {F0.her}{M0.him} in a lounger...\n\n&lt;b&gt;Splash! Splash! &lt;i&gt;Spu-lash&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;
Super Splashed...
Why do &lt;i&gt;some Sims&lt;/i&gt; have to be so inconsiderate in the pool! Don't they know pools aren't for playing?!

{0.SimFirstName} was dozing peacefully when &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; felt the need to rudely splash {F0.her}{M0.him} and wake {F0.her}{M0.him} up! The nerve of some Sims!
Silly Splashers!
Some cheeky Sim splashed {0.SimFirstName}, while {F0.she}{M0.he} was floating unaware on the water's surface! What a laugh!
Float loungers are for relaxing, not playing! If {0.SimFirstName} wanted to get wet, {F0.she'd}{M0.he'd} have gone swimming instead. How annoying!
No Splashing!
