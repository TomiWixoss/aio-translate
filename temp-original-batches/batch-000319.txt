There are some powerful and easy-to-use tools that'll help you quickly build things. Let's examine a few of them now!
Energy
Take quick naps or drink coffee when your Sims don't have time for a proper sleep.
If you don't let your Sims sleep, they'll eventually pass out.
Sims require sleep every day in a bed, chair, or even on the floor.
Sims will take care of their Energy Need if you let them and they are able to do so!
Bladder
Sims will take care of their Bladder Need if you let them and they are able to do so!
You can prevent an embarrassing moment by directing your Sim to Use the Toilet. 
Travel
There is a big world waiting for your Sim outside of their home Lot! \n\nIn addition to a change in scenery, traveling has many perks. As your Sims visit new places, they’ll encounter new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Collectibles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;experiences&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Why not order a drink at the Bar or get some help with their exercise from the trainer at the Gym?\n\nBefore your Sims can afford more expensive Objects, they can visit a Venue and use them for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;free&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For example, computers can be found at the Library.
Moving
Moving will open the World Map. Lots that you can move to without any modifications are &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;outlined in green&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Lots &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;outlined in yellow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are either too expensive to buy fully furnished, or another Household already lives there.\n\nPick a Lot and press the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Confirm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button in the lower right corner to start moving!\n\nRemember that you can use the World Select button to move to another World.
Once you’ve picked a Lot, you will get options to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;keep&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sell&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your current furniture (keeping the furniture puts them in the Household Inventory) and whether to buy the new Lot &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;furnished&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unfurnished&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bulldozed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can see your remaining funds under the Household portrait.\n\nIf you’re moving to a Lot where someone already lives, you will get a choice whether to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move in&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with them or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;evict&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them first.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Finalize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the move with the Purchase Home or Move In button!
So it’s time for your Sims to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;move someplace new&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Perhaps they have outgrown their current home, want independence from their parents, or they’ve earned enough Simoleons to buy a fancier house. Or maybe you just want a change of scenery!
You’ll find the options for moving in the Cell Phone’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Travel app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nUse the Move Household option to move the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;entire Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to a new Lot, or Split from Household and Move option to move &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;parts of the Household&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to a new Lot.\n\nThe Split option opens a new menu. Here you can decide &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;which Sims&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; will move out and how much &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; they will bring with them. You can press the Select another Household button to move them into another Household.
There is a big world waiting for your Sim outside of their home Lot! You can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;explore&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the Neighborhood your Sim lives in—who knows what adventure awaits just down the road—or use your Cell Phone to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;travel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; somewhere else.\n\nIf you want a more permanent change of scenery, or simply need more room for a growing family, you can also use the Cell Phone to move to a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;new home&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Game Speed
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Time&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; goes by, hour by hour, day by day. But in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have the power to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;control&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it!\n\nLearn all about controlling the Game Speed and how to keep track of the passing of time in the Lessons below.
Mentoring
Mentoring can be offered or asked for in two different ways. When a Sim is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;already practicing a Skill&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the Mentor can select the Offer Mentoring interaction on them, or the Mentee can select Ask for Mentoring on the Mentor.\n\nYou can also select an Offer Mentoring or Ask for Mentoring interaction on a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill-building object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If accepted, this will make the Mentee start practising the Skill before Mentoring starts. Handy, huh?\n\nMentoring is free by default, but Mentors can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Offer Paid Mentoring&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on Skill-building objects to Sims from other households. Ka-ching!
When a Sim receives Mentoring, this speeds up the rate of their Skill gain. The biggest impact on the speed is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Mentor's Skill level&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;—a Sim at Skill level 10 will be better at Mentoring than a Sim at Skill level 5!\n\nThere are other ways to boost Mentoring. For example, a Mentor can buy the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Super Mentor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Reward Trait from the Rewards Store.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Mentoring&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; allows skilled Sims to pass on their knowledge to other Sims. Once they reach &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;level 5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in a Mentorable Skill, they can Mentor other Sims in that Skill (as long as the Mentor's Skill is a higher level than the Mentee's), which speeds up Skill gain.\n\nTo find out if a Skill is Mentorable, you can check its description in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Here you can also learn on which objects Mentoring is available.
Child Skills
Children have 4 skills of their very own, called Fundamental Skills. Each Skill can be built upon by interacting with other Sims or objects. Advancing in each of the Fundamental Skills unlocks new ways for Children to interact with the world around them. \n\nChildren may also start developing certain &quot;adult&quot; Skills that are available for Teens and older. However, because they are children, they gain these skills at a slower rate. Like Fundamental Skills, these basic Skills may unlock new ways for Children to interact with the world, but some interactions will require them to age up to Teen before they become available. 
Sims need &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skills&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to pay the bills! Skills are essential for advancing in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Careers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and can also help your Sims earn some extra &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the side.\n\nSkills have other benefits as well; as your Sims improve their Skills, they will unlock new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;interactions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, craft &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;unique objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, get better at building &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and so much more.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Buy a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill Book&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the bookshelf, or a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Skill building Object&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from the Build Mode catalog, and get started!
There is also information on Skills located in the Skills panel at the bottom right. This can be accessed by clicking on the Lightbulb Icon or pressing the [L] shortcut. Progress across all Skills is easily visible in this panel, and the right column indicates current Skill Level. Hovering over a Skill Icon or Name also gives additional information about that skill and what objects allow your Sim to gain it.\n\nWhen a Skill (or multiple Skills) are actively being gained the affected Skill(s) will glow to indicate active progress.
Most Skills have a total of 10 Levels, though some will occasionally have 5. Progress for Skills can be tracked in two places. \n\nThe first place is in the game window. While actively gaining a skill, a Progress Bar will display above a Sim's head with the Skill icon. This bar indicates how close a Sim is to gaining a new level, and once the bar has completely filled a new Level in that Skill will be gained.
Romantic Boundaries
If a Sim is exploring &lt;b&gt;Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt;, they may Reconsider if asked by another Sim. Select another Sim, choose the &lt;b&gt;“Relationship”&lt;/b&gt; category, then choose the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Change Relationship&quot;&lt;/b&gt; subcategory. Find the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Ask To Reconsider Romantic Boundaries&quot;&lt;/b&gt; category. In this category there are social interactions that Sims can use to ask another Sim to Reconsider specific Romantic Boundaries.\n\nIf a Sim is &lt;b&gt;not Exploring Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt; they cannot be asked to Reconsider.\n\nLearn more about setting up your Sims' Romantic Boundaries in Lessons under &lt;b&gt;Create A Sim &gt; Identity &amp; Personality &gt; Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt;
Sims must learn each other's Romantic Boundaries by asking! Select another Sim, choose the &lt;b&gt;“Relationship”&lt;/b&gt; category then the &lt;b&gt;“Learn More”&lt;/b&gt; category, and finally choose the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Ask about Romantic Boundaries&quot;&lt;/b&gt; interaction.&#xD;&#xA;Once a Sim agrees to share this, their reply will appear as a text notification. Their Romantic Boundaries will also be recorded in their Sim Profile page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;
Even though some Sims are Loner, they are all social creatures. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Socializing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with other Sims is essential for their happiness.\n\nAs your Sim builds stronger (or at least more &lt;i&gt;intense&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with those around them, new social interactions and possibilities are unlocked. \n\nMeet new Sims and become BFFs, partners in crime, enemies with benefits, soulmates, and more! 
Pie Menu Subcategories
Within each of the main categories of the pie menu, such as &lt;b&gt;Friendly&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Mean&lt;/b&gt;, there are now a collection of subcategories present to sort interactions. Each subcategory will further classify the interactions your Sims can perform on each other, making it easier for you to find that specific &lt;b&gt;Joke&lt;/b&gt; you wanted to tell, or &lt;b&gt;Argument&lt;/b&gt; you wanted to start.\n\nUniquely important interactions, such as Proposals or Divorces, can still be found outside of subcategories.
Personality
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which is mainly based on their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, influences the way they experience and interact with the world around them in a number of ways. Learn more below!
Managing Needs
Another tip for efficient Needs management is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;multitasking&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Sims can do some things at the same time, such as eating in front of the TV to fulfill their Hunger and Fun needs at the same time.\n\nYou should also consider your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; when managing their Needs. A Bookworm will have more Fun reading, while a Music Lover prefers to listen to music.
Managing your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is essential to ensure their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;happiness&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;productivity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and even &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;survival&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!\n\nYou can see the current state of your Sim’s Needs in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Needs panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If you click on a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Need icon&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, your active Sim will try to do something to take care of that Need.
More &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;expensive Objects&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;effective&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at fulfilling Sims’ Needs. \n\nYou can check which Need an Object can fulfill, and how efficient it is, in the Object’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;tooltip&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Build catalog&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Needs
If you want to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;care&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;well being&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (or… experiment with it), look no further! \n\nManaging your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;physical&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;mental Needs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; allows them to live happy, fruitful lives; however, if they get low, they will experience negative Emotions and might even die!
They say &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;money&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can’t buy happiness, but it sure helps to keep your Sims content! Learn all about how to earn big Simoleons so your Sims can put food on the table, pay their bills, and build their dream home!
Life Stages
While Sims are still growing up, they experience many “firsts”. \n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Infants&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are entirely reliant on their caregivers to ensure their basic needs are met. Giving them lots of attention will help them in these early formative days.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Toddlers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are still largely dependent on their caregivers, and will need help learning things like how to walk and talk.\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sims take on some more advanced Skills, have their first Aspiration, and start School. \n\nSchool continues as Sims become &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Teens&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Now they can get a Part-Time Job and begin to explore their romantic interests, too!
As your Sim reaches &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;adulthood&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, they are able to join full-time Careers, get married, have or adopt children, and more. \n\nOnce your Sim become an &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Elder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, they’re able to Retire and cash in on their lifetime of hard work with a daily pension check! Elderhood is also a great time to indulge in hobbies and spend time with loved ones.
There are eight Life Stages your Sims can experience: &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Newborn&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Infant&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Toddler&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Child&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Teen&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Young Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Adult&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Elder&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nAs your Sims age and grow, there are new life events, relationships, and more to try!
Follow your Sims from the cradle to the grave. As time goes on, Sims will age and go through seven &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Life Stages&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; Baby, Toddler, Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, and Elder; each with their unique experiences and challenges.\n\nAfter a long and eventful life (or a shorter one, if your Sim has an &lt;i&gt;accident&lt;/i&gt;), all Sims must face the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Grim Reaper&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;—unless they’ve found a way to cheat death…\n\nDeath doesn’t have to be the end. Keep the remains of your late relatives around, and you might have a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;nightly visitor&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!
Falling in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;love&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;children&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and spending time with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relatives&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be a very meaningful part of your Sim’s life! \n\nFollow the newest additions to the family as they &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;grow up&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from adorable babies to inquisitive toddlers, have their first day of School as a Child, and begin to explore their identity, responsibilities, and relationships as Teens. \n\nAnd who knows, perhaps they will continue the family &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;legacy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with a child of their own one day! 
Your Sims are feeling creatures! Their current mood, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, has a big impact on what they do and how they do it. Learn about the effects of Emotions, good and bad, and how to manage them in the Lessons below.
Camera Controls
The tiny people living in your computer have big dreams (and worries)! Learn all about &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspirations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Wants&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Fears&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and how your Sim can master them to earn powerful &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Play with Life&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (and Death) in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Live Mode&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Follow your Sims from the cradle to the grave as they experience the joys and challenges of each stage of life.
Infant Care
Much like Newborns, Infants require bottle or breastfeeding for nourishment. All caregivers can bottle feed. To allow parents to breastfeed, enter &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create A Sim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. Under &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, select whether your Sim can produce milk.
Sims will autonomously want to check on and care for Infants, especially when an Infant is fussing or crying. Frequency and quality of care is impacted by a Caregiver's Traits, Ages, and Relationship with the Infant.\n\nSims who do not share a relationship with the infant won't care about them as much. Not all Sims start out as Caregivers. If a Sim in the household would like to become a Caregiver for the Infant they can click on the Infant and choose to Adopt as Care Dependent.
Time for bed! Although Infants can sleep on the floor or be given a nap, your Infant will rest better if you click on the Crib and select &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put Infant to Sleep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.\n\nSims can add a Baby Mobile to play lullabies for Infants. You can also read Infants a bedtime story and soothe them to sleep.
Infants rely on their caregivers to get their needs met, and for help with navigating the world around them. They need to be fed, changed, and paid attention to! A well-cared-for Infant is a happy Infant that is sure to grow into a successful Toddler.
Infants can also be fed in the High Chair! At this stage in their life, &quot;adult food&quot; is more about exploration and bonding. It probably won't fill them up fully, but they will enjoy the variety real food provides. \n\nInteract with the Infant or High Chair to choose this method of feeding. Each Infant will have a preference for each type of food. They can either Like, Love, Dislike, or be Unsure about a particular food.
Sims can clean up their messy infants by giving them a bath! Bathing is not just a routine, it's also an occasion to bond with family members. But beware—some splashing may occur! \n\nInteract with the bathtub or select the infant and choose to give a bath or a bubble bath.
To stay entertained, Infants can play with toybox toys, dollhouses, nesting blocks, and stuffed animals. Sims can also read Toddler Books to Infants.
Keep Infants and Toddlers in an area with baby proofing! Click on a door or gate and select &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apply Baby Proofing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; under the &lt;font color=&quot;#199C2C&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lock For...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; category.

Create A Sim
Getting Started
Relatives &amp; Relationships
You can set the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relationship&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; between your Sims in the Household Relationships menu. \n\nSome relationships are restricted by age; for example, a Sim has to be a Young Adult or older to have children, and their children must be younger than them.
You can find the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Play with Genetics&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button in the Add a Sim menu. Selecting this button opens the Genetics panel.
When creating a Sim by Playing with Genetics, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;relationships&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are automatically applied.
When creating a new Household, you can decide if the Sims are roomies, relatives, or partners. \n\nBy using the Genetics tool, you can make new Sims that look like your existing Sims by using their “genes”. This is an easy way to add children, parents, and siblings!
In the Genetics panel, choose a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Relationship&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Child, Sibling, or Parent), pick &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;who&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; they are related to, select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and roll your new Sim by clicking the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Randomize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button.\n\n\nIf you like the result, select the Done button to add the new Sim to your Household.
Makeup
Most makeup swatches include &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;sliders&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to customize your Sim's look further. Adjust the Hue, Opacity, Saturation, and Brightness to customize the makeup for that perfect look.\n\nYou can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Save&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a customized swatch to use it again later.
To customize your Sim’s makeup, select their face and then the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Makeup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button. This will show you all makeup options, or you can view each subcategory at a time.
Most makeup have multiple color options, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;swatches&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. You can find an item’s swatches below it in the menu.\n\nIf you want to find every makeup option that has a swatch of a specific color, you can use the color filter. Learn more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filters Lesson&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Elevate your Sim's look with &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;makeup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Add some flair to your Sim's face with eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, lipstick, and face paint to bring out their unique sense of self.
Clothes
Each category has a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;preset filter&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that determines which clothing options are available. The preset is only a suggestion; feel free to remove or change these filters as you wish!\n\nAlmost all Create a Sim items are available for all genders and Outfit categories if you remove the preset filters.
Most clothing pieces have multiple color options, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;swatches&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Some swatches even have unique patterns and prints! You can find an item’s swatches below it in the menu.\n\nIf you want to find every piece of Clothing that has a swatch of a specific color, you can use the color filter. Learn more in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Filters Lesson&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Accessories, Shoes &amp; Hats
In some categories, you can select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;multiple&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; items. Why not flaunt your bling by wearing a ring on each finger and bracelets on both wrists?
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Shoes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;socks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;leggings&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rings&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;bracelets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;nailpolish&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be accessed by selecting your Sim’s body.\n\nSelect &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Shoes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to show all shoes, or use the subcategories to browse a more specific selection. \n\nIf you select &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it will show all socks, leggings, rings, bracelets, and nailpolish, or you can select a subcategory’s button to browse just those items.
Nothing adds character and flair to an outfit like &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;accessories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Dress your Sim up in hats, shoes, bracelets, glasses, earrings and more to express their unique sense of style.

Outfits
You can have up to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;5 Outfits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in each category. Select the arrow above the outfit category button and then the plus button to add more Outfits to that category.\n\nYou can delete an outfit by pressing the x, but you must have at least one outfit per category.
Voice &amp; Walkstyle
Does your Sim speak in a high pitch or a low rumble? Do they saunter, strut, or bounce down the street? You can customize your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Walkstyle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the Identity panel.
Traits &amp; Aspirations
A Sim’s Aspiration is what they aspire to be, do, and experience! Sims will be given &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;goals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; based on their Aspiration that can be completed for &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nSelect the Pick an Aspiration button to pick your first &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Most Aspiration &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;categories&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have multiple options. For instance, click on Food and choose between Master Chef and Master Mixologist!\n\nYour first Aspiration will also give your Sim a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Bonus Trait&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that you can see next to your selected Aspiration!
What’s going on inside your Sim’s head? Their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Traits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; define their personality, and their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Aspiration&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; gives them goals and dreams!
To customize your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, select a Pick a Trait button and pick Traits until all Trait slots are filled. These Traits affect everything in the game from Emotions and Skills to Hobbies and Relationships.\n\nSome Traits can't be &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;paired&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with other Traits. For example, you can't be both Good and Evil. \n\nSome traits may be more &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;challenging&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to play with, but they will provide unique opportunities for your Sims!
