Sort of. While {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} wearing a paper hat.

Nanny
{0.SimFirstName} can’t wait to finally earn some dough-and what could be more fun than getting paid to play with kids? Besides, the kids are asleep half the time, right? So it’s basically getting paid to couch-sit and text all {M0.his}{F0.her} friends. Cake!
