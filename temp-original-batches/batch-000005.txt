Class Performance
There are many ways for students to succeed in a university course:\n\n• Going to class\n• Completing homework\n• Studying on textbooks, computers, or research archives\n• Practicing the course's related skill\n• Submitting a good final paper or presentation\n• Visiting the professor during office hours\n\nStudents may not need to do all of these, but neglecting a large number will surely result in poor grades. Students who wish to get a sense of how they're doing in a class can check with their professors via phone or computer, though final grades will only be released after the term has ended.
