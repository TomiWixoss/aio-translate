Batuu
This remote outpost on the galaxy’s edge was once a busy crossroads along the old sub-lightspeed trade routes, but its prominence was bypassed by the rise of hyperspace travel. Now home to those who prefer to stay out of the mainstream, it has become a thriving port for smugglers, rogue traders, and adventurers traveling between the frontier and uncharted space. It was once a safe haven for those intent on avoiding the expanding reach of the First Order, but the struggle between the First Order and the Resistance has made it's way to Batuu.

The gorgeous Sulani island chain welcomes all to a life of blue oceans and friendly neighbors. The main islands show off the many walks of life from the community centered Ohan'ali Town, to the more lavish upscale Lani St. Taz, and even down to the seemingly vancant Mua Pel'am. All around is the beauty of nature no matter where you look.

San Myshuno
This city is made up of four distinct districts: the Spice Market, the Fashion District, The Arts Quarter and Uptown.\n\nIn addition, Myshuno Meadows is a large city park tucked beneath the skyscrapers if your Sims need to get away for a touch of nature.\n\nDepending on where your Sims choose to live, you’ll get a very different flavor of the city. You might find yourself in a cramped, roach-infested studio apartment in the Arts Quarter… Or you might be enjoying a breathtaking view of the city from your very own tricked-out rooftop penthouse Jacuzzi in Uptown.
