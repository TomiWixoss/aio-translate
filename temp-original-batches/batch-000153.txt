Open Quirk Slot
Locked Quirk Slot 
\nThis quirk slot is locked until you've reached a higher Celebrity Level.
\nA celebrity's behavior determines what quirks they develop.
As a Sim increases their Celebrity Level, they drift further from normal life. At certain levels, Sims will gain new Quirk Slots, which can be filled with Quirks based on the behavior they engage in.\n\nOnce acquired, Quirks may be removed by using the Celestial Crystal Crown or drinking the Quirk-B-Gone reward potion. Removing a quirk will open up the slot, which may then get filled by a new quirk!\n\nThe Sim's current quirks may be seen under Earned Quirks, while all possible quirks can be seen under All Quirks.
Earned Quirks
All Quirks
This Sim's fame will be reset and they will no longer gain fame. Default fame settings for all Sims can be set in the Game Options.
Quit the Spotlight
Sims with Fame Perks can't quit the spotlight. To remove Fame Perks from a Sim, use the phone or computer to Book a Celebrity Cleanse.
Stay Out of the Spotlight?
WARNING: This action will reset any fame gained by this Sim to zero. If the Sim steps back into the spotlight later, they will restart from there.\n\nOnce out of the spotlight, the Sim will not gain any fame or become a celebrity. This button will then allow them to reverse this decision at any time.
This Sim will be able to gain fame and become a celebrity. Default fame settings for all Sims can be set in the Game Options.
