A major corporation has purchased {0.SimFirstName}'s jingle. A solid bit of pay for a solid bit of work.
Several companies loved the jingle and bid to be the proud owners of it. Jackpot!
No companies wanted to purchase that jingle. Better luck next time!

Compliment
(From Successfully Talking Up Someone)
(From Having an Engaging Conversation)
I was extremely hopeful heading into that conversation, but after spending a brief amount of time with {2.SimFirstName} it became obviously clear to me that we weren't meant to be friends.
I let optimism get the best of me, {0.SimFirstName}. {2.SimFirstName} and I hold our actions to different standards; I don't see a way to work around that.
Unfortunately {2.SimFirstName} and I tried to work it out, but we really are just two completely different people.
