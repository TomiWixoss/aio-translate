Need to hide a secret? Bury it via the Information Broker on the PC and nobody has to know...
Did you know? In Ondarion, you have a higher chance of finding a rare Noble Frog!
Sims in Ondarion say that mastering Swordsmanship may let you draw the Sword in the Stone.
Proud Sims might avoid duelling you if you're too skilled; boost Charisma to improve your chances.
Swordsmanship is a Noble art, so losing a duel against a Commoner is just so scandalous!
The Ondarion Swordsmanship tournaments are prestigious events with extraordinary prizes.
Is someone extorting you? Confront them with a fight, persuade them to stop, or maybe just hope for their untimely demise?
The info broker is mysterious; can you uncover their true identity yourself?
A confident, playful or focused Sim can more easily extort an embarrassed, stressed, or uncomfortable one.
