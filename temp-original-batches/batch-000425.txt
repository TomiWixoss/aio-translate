Resident Grant
For teens and young adults, the place they live may offer grants providing students financial help in pursuing a university education. Each location has its own grant amounts, and students are encouraged to apply and represent their community!
Sports &amp; E-Sports Scholarships
There are a few scholarships that require Sims to participate in an after-school activity as part of their requirements. An Athletics scholarship requires the Sim to be a Soccer Team Player, while the E-Sports Scholarship requires the Sim to be E-Sports Competitor. A Sim cannot be accepted by both of these scholarships at the same time.
Career Scholarships
Universities want to encourage younger Sims that may already be dipping their toes in the job market. These scholarships offer teen and young adult Sims who have achieved some amount of career success with a way to help pay for a university education that can boost them in their career of choice in the future.
Skill Scholarships
Sims who have developed any number of practical skills are eligible to apply for a variety of skill-based scholarships. Those hours spent working on cooking, fishing, handiness, and many other skills can turn into scholarship funds! However, these scholarships are targeted at younger students and so are not available to adult or elder Sims.
Need-Based Scholarships
Every Sim deserves a university education, and the need-based Education for All and Helping Hand scholarships are designed to give Sims from households with less a chance to attend. Sims with less savings and assets are encouraged to apply!
Distinguished Scholarships
Sims who have been accepted into distinguished degree programs will automatically receive scholarships, with an amount based on how many distinguished degrees they’ve gotten into. Working on a Sim’s grade and skills before applying can lead to more degree acceptances and, in turn, more scholarship money!
