{0.SimFirstName} is invited to demo an up-and-coming game at its launch party. By the time the game’s unveiled, {M0.he}{F0.she} is feeling a little dazed from all the socializing, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been smack-talking with other pros for hours. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} step up to the plate, or call it early and get some much needed rest?
At last! {0.SimFirstName} has presented {M0.his}{F0.her} very own idea for a game and the CEO is interested. The hitch is that he wants to make a few changes to the concept that will make it kind of…suck. {0.SimFirstName} can charge forward with the project anyway and hope to save it as {M0.he}{F0.she} goes, or pitch it to a different studio.
Some button masher has made it into {0.SimFirstName}’s online game lobby, and his relentless stream of insults is kind of wrecking everything. How’s a pro supposed to practice with all this racket-and poor playing? Does {0.SimFirstName} mute the offender and tough it out, or try to boot the jerk?
The pool table seemed like a good idea. It had always been {0.SimFirstName}’s fantasy: to build a company with a pool table. But now {M0.his}{F0.her} team is spending a little too much time in the rec room and not enough at their desks. {0.SimFirstName} can either sell it off, or lay down the law with {M0.his}{F0.her} employees.
{0.SimFirstName} is pitching {M0.his}{F0.her} Next Big Idea when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices that the key partner in the investment firm is messing around on his phone. {M0.He}{F0.She} can ignore it and continue {M0.his}{F0.her} pitch, or try to engage the investor with a question.
{0.SimFirstName} is slinging code like a rockstar when {M0.he}{F0.she} is suddenly transferred into a position {M0.he}{F0.she} has no experience with. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} speak up and ask for training, or wing it with the book they gave {M0.him}{F0.her}?
{0.SimFirstName} is signed up for a high-profile multiplayer competition with a team handpicked by the sponsor. Trouble is, one of their guys is all marketing and no game, and {0.SimFirstName} is sure he will cost them the win. {M0.He}{F0.She} can raise the issue with the sponsor, or let the player do himself in.
Buyout Offer
A rival company contacts {0.SimFirstName} privately with an offer to buy {M0.his}{F0.her} new feather-light speaker. {0.SimFirstName} can sell out and take the cash, or stand by {M0.his}{F0.her} product and hope it's successful.
Under Pressure
{0.SimFirstName}'s new project is already falling behind schedule. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} insist that everyone work late, or try to persuade {M0.his}{F0.her} boss that {M0.he}{F0.she} needs more time?
{0.SimFirstName} is priming for an important tournament when the motherboard on {M0.his}{F0.her} rig burns out. With only a little time left, {M0.he}{F0.she} has to choose between trying to fix it quickly or using one of the competition’s machines instead.
{0.SimFirstName} notices everyone grinning and laughing, but chat windows disappear when {M0.he}{F0.she} comes around. {M0.He}{F0.She} can pretend not to notice or confront {M0.his}{F0.her} team.
{0.SimFirstName}’s producer has started sending panicked emails to {M0.him}{F0.her} several times a day. It’s hard to get any work done when {M0.he}{F0.she} has to keep handling every one of these little “emergencies.” {0.SimFirstName} can either ignore the emails, or research a larger solution that will solve all the producer’s problems.
Investor Update
{0.SimFirstName}'s first investors are nearly as enthusiastic as {M0.he}{F0.she} is, which would be great, if they weren't always asking for status updates. Now the investors are asking again and the status is, well, not good. Does {0.SimFirstName} lie and assure them that it's fine, or come clean?
A Chance to Cheat!
In {M0.his}{F0.her} final hours of training before a match, {0.SimFirstName} finds a previously undiscovered exploit in the competition build of the game. {M0.He}{F0.She} can try to use it to {M0.his}{F0.her} advantage during the match, or let everyone know.
{0.SimFirstName}’s assistant has booked {0.SimPronounObjective} to give the keynote at a prominent executives-only event right during {M0.his}{F0.her} annual {M0.men’s}{F0.women’s} ski day. {0.SimFirstName} can keep the speaking engagement, or invent a more dire conflict.
A Tempting Sum
Getting famous is fun, but it can have its downsides. Like when a competitor offers {0.SimFirstName} a bribe to throw the next game. It's hard not to feel a little honored--and the bribe is substantial... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the cash or refuse?
{0.SimFirstName} is supposed to demo at the Game Developers Showcase, but breaks {M0.his}{F0.her} smartphone bungee-jumping at another game’s booth. {M0.He}{F0.She} could try to find a show associate and ask when {M0.his}{F0.her} shift starts, or use the excuse to skip work and be one of the first to play WAR MEADOW 6.
Sloppy Code
{0.SimFirstName} notices that {M0.his}{F0.her} new Co-worker has introduced a huge bug. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} tell their feature producer, or keep quiet and try to fix it for him?
{0.SimFirstName} gets unofficial word that a competitor is coming out with a product nearly identical to the one {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} tasked with developing. {M0.He}{F0.She} can alert upper management or hang tight and hope the competitor falls on its face.
The Needs of the Few
{0.SimFirstName}'s company has just launched an exciting re-design of their most popular software. Unfortunately a small but vocal minority of users are complaining about it. Should {0.SimFirstName} risk changing it again to appease them, or ignore the complaints?
Customer Satisfaction
An irate customer contacts {0.SimFirstName} demanding a refund on her new smartphone. {M0.He}{F0.She} could just give the customer a refund and get back to the game {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} been playing, or try to calm her down and talk her through the problem.
{0.SimFirstName} is tearing it up at a local tournament when a random mascot from a different game starts hovering over {M0.him}{F0.her}. The green fur is distracting enough, but when the mascot starts leading the crowd in raucous cheers, {0.SimFirstName} is faced with a tough decision: embrace the attention, or send the furball packing.
Endorsement Deal
A certain deodorant company is offering {0.SimFirstName} cash to promote their latest product at {M0.his}{F0.her} next event. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn't have to do much...just wear a heat-mapping t-shirt that highlights {M0.his}{F0.her} pits and give a short plug on how it helps {0.SimPronounObjective} stay cool. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} take the cash deal, or pass? 
{0.SimFirstName} knows the rival wouldn't make an offer if they didn't have a cause for concern. Before {M0.he}{F0.she} knows it, they have desperately tripled their offer! Now {0.SimFirstName} knows that {M0.his}{F0.her} idea is going to be a huge success, and it's staying right there with {0.SimPronounObjective}.
Well, hindsight is always 20-20. Another rival announces its own ultralight speaker, and all of {0.SimFirstName}'s offers mysteriously vanish. Worse, the rival speaker will hit the market well before {M0.his}{F0.her} model is ready.
{0.SimFirstName} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} nose clean and {M0.his}{F0.her} head held high, and feels pretty awesome for it. {M0.His}{F0.Her} newfound confidence helps {0.SimPronounObjective} crush the match, qualifying {0.SimPronounObjective} for the next tournament.
Wing It
Speak Up
Wait It Out
Speak Up
Phew! The schedule is back on track and upper management is pleased. {0.SimFirstName}'s team is complaining pretty loudly, but at least this time they have a reason!
Sell Off the Product
Keep the Product
It works! The producer commends {0.SimFirstName}, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} has a favor in the bank with the new guy. That could come in handy!
Well, it was gracious of {0.SimFirstName} to try, but all {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to do is make the bug worse. Now everyone notices the bug and blames {M0.him}{F0.her}! Strangely enough, the new Co-worker stays quiet as a mouse while the producer gives {0.SimFirstName} an earful.
Praise is rare around here, but {0.SimFirstName} has earned a feather in {M0.his}{F0.her} cap, at least with {M0.his}{F0.her} producer. The Co-worker, on the other hand, yells at {0.SimFirstName} for making him look bad and then falls into a rather vengeful silence.
HA HA HA HA!! More time! That's hilarious. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} for a good laugh and dismisses {M0.him}{F0.her}. Well, here's hoping the dev team likes pizza! Every night. For the next eight weeks.
{0.SimFirstName}'s manager thanks {0.SimPronounObjective} for bringing this matter to his attention and gives the team more time. {0.SimFirstName} comes out a hero to both upper management and {M0.his}{F0.her} underlings.
Can't please everybody, and what is it that the haters are gonna do? Oh, right: hate. {0.SimFirstName} stands behind the re-design, and online orders of the software exceed the previous version's by 35 percent!
What great service! The customer is delighted that {0.SimFirstName}’s company is so gracious about refunds and departs happily to post all about it.
Investors appreciate honesty, and products get delayed all the time. {0.SimFirstName} carries on with development as planned.
Sponsors pay, but {0.SimFirstName} needs to show some self-respect! {M0.His}{F0.Her} fans react horribly to the marketing stunt, trashing {0.SimPronounObjective} in the forums. But at least the money's good.
The stunt is a little outrageous, but no one really expects anything less. After all, {0.SimFirstName} is the {M0.guy}{F0.girl} who gets paid to game. No one cares who's paying! They just want to see the main event!

The users have actually identified some design flaws that no one picked up in testing. Everyone loves the simple improvements, and sales go up.
The haters love the changes--and the fact that the company listened--but now the vast majority of users are complaining that it was better before. Orders of the software suffer.
Whoops. {0.SimFirstName}'s investors turn out to be a lot more seasoned than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. They see through the act and promptly pull out. Back to pounding the pavement...
{0.SimFirstName}'s political savvy is paying off! Mystified by the expert-sounding technical jargon {M0.he}{F0.she} sprinkles throughout the update, the investors believe {M0.him}{F0.her} and invest even more.

Amazing! In a surprise move, {0.SimFirstName} talks the customer through her problems and appeases her without refunding a single Simoleon. {0.SimFirstName}’s boss is so impressed that he begins transferring more “challenging” customers {M0.his}{F0.her} way.
{0.SimFirstName} should have learned by now that this kind of customer is just looking for a target, and {M0.his}{F0.her} backside may as well have red and white circles on it. Now even more furious, the customer demands to speak to {0.SimFirstName}’s manager.

What a star! {0.SimFirstName} is top of the QA team and {M0.his}{F0.her} dedication does not go unrewarded. {M0.His}{F0.Her} co-worker is a bit miffed to have missed all the fun and glory, but he’s taking it out on a dog toy that he thinks is a stress ball.

Turns out taking a bribe is hard! Losing a game convincingly is even harder than winning a game legitimately! {0.SimFirstName} fumbles it so badly that the crowd is immediately suspicious. The officials promise a follow-up investigation and {0.SimFirstName}'s competitor refuses to pay!
Turns out taking a bribe is hard! Losing a game convincingly is even harder than winning a game legitimately! But {0.SimFirstName} pulls it off and gets the cash.
