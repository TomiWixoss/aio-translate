I have an amazing idea for an atmospheric, story-driven piece of interactive media. Players will be compelled to experience it from start to finish just from the sheer brilliance of it. Even the most jaded tough guy won't be able to keep from breaking down at the emotional rollercoaster I put them on.\n\nI've already prepared an area of my apartment for all of the awards this game will receive. Just need someone to make it.
