Feeling Fulfilled
{0.SimFirstName} checks one more task off the list of things that {M0.HE}{F0.SHE} wants to do.
Sore Back!
Ouch! That mattress was firm. Like concrete.
Voodoo: Uneasy
You have the oddest sensation, you are feeling uneasy and not quite like yourself. What Happened? What is going on?
Voodoo: Pain
Ouch! It’s like that ‘pins-and-needles’ feeling when your foot is asleep, but all over, at random, with white-hot pokers.
Voodoo: Flirty
There are times you feel more “amorous” than others, and then there’s the sudden, sizzling urge you’re sensing right now.
Voodoo: Joy
You are suddenly brimming with delight, like you could positively burst into spontaneous flight!
Voodoo: Dazed
{0.SimFirstName} feels strangely Dazed, as though {M0.he}{F0.she} has hit {M0.his}{F0.her} head.
You Do the Voodoo
Emboldened by the knowledge that the fate of another Sim is now in {0.SimFirstName}'s hands.
Voodoo: Fizzle
{0.SimFirstName}'s attempt to brighten someone’s day through magic has failed and left {M0.him}{F0.her} dejected.
Voodoo: Backfire
The power of karma compels you to reap what you sow.
