Hooray! {0.SimFirstName} emerges from the other side of the wormhole into an exact duplicate of {M0.his}{F0.her} own universe, in which the only difference is that {M0.he}{F0.she} is no longer wanted by the law. Wow! What are the odds??
The sheriff is so far back that {0.SimFirstName} has time to see what happens…out from the wormhole floats some kind of unknown crystal formation. Intriguing! {0.SimFirstName} quickly scoops it into {M0.his}{F0.her} ship for further analysis.
After an hour, {0.SimFirstName} accepts that nothing interesting is going to materialize from the wormhole. And this detour gave the Star Sheriff more than enough time to catch up with {0.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} will be forced to dump {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo!
Turn Her Down
Assign Some Officers
Ignore It
Ship the Cargo
{0.SimFirstName} painstakingly adds, subtracts, and does other complicated math stuff for every single trajectory. It takes a long time, and since the work didn’t require any special expertise, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets no credit for {M0.his}{F0.her} effort. 
Reputation is everything in this business and {0.SimFirstName} is just starting out. Better to be known as someone who gets the job done than to make a few extra Simoleons.
Obey the Order
Follow {M0.His}{F0.Her} Instincts
Violating Code
{0.SimFirstName} hears about a space factory that’s violating the interstellar safety code. When {M0.he}{F0.she} shows up to regulate, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds the entire plant locked down-no passing through, even for law enforcement. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to sweet talk the guard, or use {M0.his}{F0.her} authority to get in the door?
Critical Errors
Solar panels on the shuttle are reporting critical errors during the latest launch simulation. Those puppies are brand-new, and they were expensive! {0.SimFirstName} can either try to fix them, or just install new ones. 
Moon Rock Running
{0.SimFirstName} is cruising through Star Vortex B, carrying a payload of moon rocks for a regular client. But a brand-new client calls with a better offer-much better-although {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to quit {M0.his}{F0.her} current job. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} honor the original job, or ditch it for the better offer?
Small Fire
There’s a small fire on {0.SimFirstName}’s ship! Passing into the thermosphere, an oxygen tank got a little too close to a scented candle. ({M0.He}{F0.She} knew it was a bad idea, even if the extra ambiance was a nice touch.) Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to put the fire out, or head for the escape pod? 
Import Taxes
{0.SimFirstName}’s got a big shipment of Kleebtonic Shuttle Tiles coming in from the planet Qrimple. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} a little cash-poor this month, so the import taxes are going to hurt a bit. Slipping the tiles into some crates of Ultraterran coffee might help them slip past customs. Should {0.SimFirstName} chance it, or just declare the tiles and pay {M0.his}{F0.her} tariff? 
A Passing Grade
{0.SimFirstName}’s got {M0.his}{F0.her} big Space Geography exam coming up tomorrow. If {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t pass, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} never be accepted into Flight School. But {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been doing busy work all day and hasn’t studied.... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} cram or just take it easy, get some rest, and hope for the best?
A Course Decision
{0.SimFirstName}’s already charted out the course for {M0.his}{F0.her} current mission, but mission control says that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} headed straight for a previously undetected asteroid field. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t want the ship to get too banged up, so should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to change {M0.his}{F0.her} course, or just steer very carefully through the asteroids?
Small Capsule
While scrubbing down some exhaust vents on the shuttle, {0.SimFirstName} finds a small capsule stuck to the inside. It looks like it came from outer space! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} turn it in immediately, or open it up to see what’s inside? 
Security Detail
An intergalactic pop star is passing through on her way to a big concert out near the Medrodema Galaxy. As her entourage passes through, she demands patrol officers serve as extra security. Should {0.SimFirstName} assign a few deputies to protect the star, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} turn her down? 
Dangerous Shipment
A new client contacts {0.SimFirstName} about a shipment of Dire Space Chinchillas. {0.SimFirstName}’s never shipped them before-they have nasty little teeth, and if {0.SimFirstName} is caught with them, they could land {M0.him}{F0.her} in space prison. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the dangerous job, or just ignore it? 
Error Message
On a trip to the moons of Wheeler VII, {0.SimFirstName} gets a disturbing error message about a fuel capacity emergency. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} still the junior {M0.spaceman}{F0.spacewoman} on the team, and {M0.his}{F0.her} senior officer says to dump the fuel and head for home. {0.SimFirstName} thinks it’s something else-should {M0.he}{F0.she} obey, or follow {M0.his}{F0.her} instincts? 
Everyone in the galaxy wants a coat made from Snyxskin, and {0.SimFirstName}'s got the biggest cache of pelts. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} charge a fair and reasonable price for the goods, or gouge the customers for all they've got?
Space Mission
{0.SimFirstName} has finally been assigned an official space mission! While on {M0.his}{F0.her} first shuttle trip, a routine exploratory mission around planet Maazaa, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices something strange off in the distance. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} investigate, or leave it alone?
Navigation System
{0.SimFirstName} has a great idea for a new ship navigation system, but it hasn’t been approved by {M0.his}{F0.her} bosses yet. {M0.He}{F0.She} knows it’d save everyone time and energy if they just tried it. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} install it without permission, or wait until {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the final go-ahead?
Simulation Emergency
During a recertification simulation, {0.SimFirstName}’s instructor programs a low-fuel emergency-AND a broken thruster. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} still got to land the ship, so should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to fix the thruster, or land with it broken?
The policy of the Planet Patrol is to stop and search every “suspicious-looking being” an officer encounters, alien or humanoid. {0.SimFirstName}’s out making {M0.his}{F0.her} late-night rounds when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a group of teenage Glorzaks just hanging out. The manual says {M0.he}{F0.she} should search their pockets, but they’re not doing anything wrong. What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do? 
Planet Patrol
It’s another routine inspection at Space Way Station Cargo Checkpoint Alpha, and {0.SimFirstName} notices a suspicious wiggling in the back of one spacecraft. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} inspect the cargo immediately, or just look up the pilot’s registration number?
Space Trash
Sheriff {0.SimFirstName}’s been noticing a lot of travelers dumping trash out of their shuttle windows, and it’s littering up all the spaceways. {0.SimFirstName} is sick of paying for the cleanup-should {M0.he}{F0.she} make trash dumping illegal, or just stop cleaning it at all?
Gangster Job
A notorious space gangster has called to offer {0.SimFirstName} a job. He’s a real nasty piece of work-maybe even too nasty for {0.SimFirstName}! For the first time ever, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} conflicted about a job.  Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the assignment, or turn it down? 
Calculations
An analyst asks {0.SimFirstName} to calculate some trajectories for satellite orbits, which is a total snoozefest, and {0.SimFirstName}’s already busy. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either try to find a formula to make the equations easier, or calculate each one by hand.
The Star Sheriff is hot on {0.SimFirstName}'s tail, so {M0.he}{F0.she} takes a detour through an uncharted galaxy—and comes face-to-face with a giant wormhole. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} go through the wormhole to avoid capture, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} wait by it to see what happens?
