Select Tenants
There aren't any Tenants in this Unit to Evict.
The distinction between a Just and Unjust Eviction is important. Just Evictions carry no repercussions, while Unjust ones will harm the Property Owner's relationship with the Tenant, lower the Unit Rating, and potentially lead to an Eviction settlement, costing additional Simoleons for the Property Owner.

This section shows all active and broken rules for this unit. Property Owners can Post Fine using the mailbox or by selecting the Tenant unit's door. They may also select the Tenant Sim directly to Prosecute a Fine. Tenant Sims have the opportunity to Negotiate Rule Change for any of the active rules as long as it isn't broken. Be mindful that unpaid fines for broken Rules give the Property Owner a chance to Justly Evict the Tenant Household without any consequences.
