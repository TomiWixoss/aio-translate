The rent for this apartment includes maid service.
A flirty vibe radiates from the beautiful fireplace in this apartment. The Landlord won't allow this fireplace to be removed or sold.
Maybe it's the insulation or maybe the neighbors are very polite. Either way, it's never noisy here. &#xA;
Full of funky fertile earth energy, twins are born here more often than not. 
The deposit for this apartment is suspiciously low...
Tell a joke...get some laughs...easy peasy.
Wow! That Sim's outfit looks amazing on them! It really brings out their eyes!
Can't forget to finish that homework assignment!
Time to work at a comfortable pace!
Let {1.SimFirstName}'s creativity flow!
Another day, another Simoleon!
One step at a time!
What is love?! IS IT EVEN REAL?
There's a variety of metals to be found! Who knew rocks could get even cooler?
How can there be so many different types of frogs?! {1.SimFirstName} gotta gather them all!
{1.SimFirstName} can't wait to get a new fossil to unravel a new story waiting to be told!
Crystals are so shiny and beautiful! Is that shiny thing on the ground one?!
Maybe it's about time {1.SimFirstName} finds something to collect.
What is that smell? And how long has it been out there?
Can't wait to tell {2.SimFirstName} everything that happened today!
Kids always have the most interesting things to say!
Let's catch up with {2.SimFirstName}!
It is time to mingle!
Who to chat with today?
It is time to set a new fish catching record!
It is time to set a new fish catching record!
That is a big fish in the water there!
That is a big fish in the water there!
It is a beautiful day to go fishing! Hmmm... what bait to use today?
What a beautiful day to go catch some fish!
The best bonding event is between a parent, a toddler, and a TV.
{2.SimFirstName} ready for storytime?!
{2.SimFirstName} looks like {F2.she}{M2.he} wants a good laugh. {1.SimFirstName} has just the story!
{2.SimFirstName}, say &quot;Sul Sul&quot;!
Now stack the blocks just like this!
This is how to show your moves!
{2.SimFirstName}! &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
{2.SimFirstName} wants some snuggle time!
Good for talking points, study guides, fun facts, and more!
Bring it on {2.SimFirstName}! Burn off that energy! Safely!
Who's ready for a bed time story?
Reading time! &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;
First steps to growing up!
Who wants to play?!
It's tea time!
{2.SimFirstName} is reaching out for a hug! Who could resist?!
Someone looks a bit hungry! It's feeding time!
Sippy cups prevent spilled milk, and someone wants their cup!
What could be better than bubbles and a rubber ducky?
Smell that? It might be time for a bath, {2.SimFirstName} is maxed out on stink.
Aww, poor little {2.SimFirstName} is upset!
Let's make sure that {2.SimFirstName} is having a good time.
Oh no. What is that smell?
How is little {2.SimFirstName} doing? Let's check in about how the baby's day went!
Time to pick up the phone and start dialing!
{1.SimFirstName} wants... no, NEEDS this!
Money can't buy happiness. But it can buy this!
{1.SimFirstName} can prepare for family expansion with some shopping!
When was the last time {1.SimFirstName} bought anything? &quot;Treat yo self!&quot;
A Burglar Alarm should help {1.SimFirstName} stop any more uninvited guests from making off with {1.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} things!
There is no such thing as being too prepared, right? Just a little bit of intel collecting.
Fellow bros, where are you? The bro hug calls!
Let the world feel how {1.SimFirstName} feels inside.
{1.SimFirstName} fell out of love with {2.SimFirstName}. And even though it's hard, {1.SimFirstName} knows the right thing to do is to have an honest discussion so they both can move on.
Sometimes love is not forever and maybe it's time to go back to the single life.
There are simply too many things to choose from! What's the best possession to show off?!
Bouncy time!
It's okay to take time to feel all the emotions! Let it out!
Nothing like a solid prank on a solid friend.
Joke's on {2.SimFirstName}, this is what {M2.he}{F2.she} deserves. For everyone to laugh.
{1.SimFirstName}'s feeling a tad mischievous right now, and it looks like there are quite a few Sims over there!
Look for an event that could be made funnier...in {1.SimFirstName}'s own away.
During an Event, spread joy by trying to Sabotage an Object or Plant, rot foods by Spreading Delicious Sauce, or just being Mean with others.
It might not be the best outlet but {1.SimFirstName} has some aggression that {M1.he}{F1.she} wants to get out. Hopefully {2.SimFirstName} will understand.
What are friends for but to be a test run for truly evil machinations?
Time to give them the harshness what they deserve.
How are Good Sims so nice and good all the time? Time to turn that smile upside down!
Let that kid know what's up!
What are friends for if not to share misery together!
Time to ruin someone's day!
