Create Dynasty without Heir?
An Heir will be able to generate more Prestige than a normal Member. The Head of the Dynasty can designate or change an Heir at any time.\n\nAre you sure you want to create this Dynasty without designating an Heir first?
A Dynasty is made up of a group of related Sims. Anyone who is related to the Dynasty Head, or is the child, grand child, or step child of another member, is allowed to join. \n\nNot all Sims who can join want to join, or are allowed by the Dynasty Head to join! Improving the relationship between the Sim and the Dynasty Head, and increasing the Dynasty's Prestige, may help in such situations.

Dynasties can choose up to three Ideals to embrace as Dynasty Values.\n\nMembers who engage in the Ideal's Encouraged Activities, go to work in an Encouraged Career, or participate in an Encouraged Extracurricular will generate Prestige for the Dynasty. Members who engage in the Ideal's Discouraged Activities or go to work in an Discouraged Career will make the Dynasty lose Prestige.\n\nMost Members will engage in the Ideal's Encouraged Activities more often on their own but only if Autonomy is set to Full in Game Options &gt; Gameplay. However, members who have Traits who are opposed to an Ideal (for example, the Evil Trait is opposed to the Caring Ideal) may engage in Discouraged Activities more often instead!

Dynasty Heads can declare Rivalries or form Alliances with the Head of another Dynasty.\n\nThe Dynasty will gain Prestige on starting a new Alliance or Rivalry, and from interacting with Members of those Dynasties, but lose Prestige if it is ended.\n\nAlliances are harder to start and maintain, but has mainly positive effects, while Rivalries are easier to start and uphold, but come with negative consequences as well.
Alliances &amp; Rivalries
Members of Allied Dynasties enjoy improved Relationships and gain Prestige when being Friendly.\n\nAsking for Blessing to Marry is more likely to succeed between Allies, and Allies are also more likely to befriend, propose dates, and visit each other.
