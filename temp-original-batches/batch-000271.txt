Hmmm... {0.SimFirstName} was unsure about {1.ObjectName}. Maybe this food will need to be explored again.
Yay! {0.SimFirstName} liked {1.ObjectName}. Successful taste testing!
Oh no! {0.SimFirstName} disliked {1.ObjectName}. Probably best to try something else next time...

That sounds terrible! I'll talk to {2.SimFirstName} myself.
Are you kidding me? Does {2.SimFirstName} really think like that? I'm a bit caught off guard, but I'll talk with {F2.her}{M2.him} soon.
I understand your concern {0.SimFirstName}; I'll chat with {2.SimFirstName} soon. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous to approach {F2.her}{M2.him} after hearing that.
Wow, I’d love to get to know {M2.him}{F2.her}.
{2.SimFirstName} sounds like {F2.she}{M2.he} is an absolute pleasure to be around!
Wow {0.SimFirstName}! I wasn't aware that you felt so strongly about {2.SimFirstName}. {F2.She}{M2.He} seems like good company, I'll chat with {F2.her}{M2.him} soon.
{2.SimFirstName} sounds like a catch. I'll introduce myself when I see {2.SimPronounObjective}.

{M2.He}{F2.She} can’t be all that bad…
I completely understand if you and {2.SimFirstName} have issues, but I'd prefer if you left me out of your drama.
Those are some harsh words, {0.SimFirstName}. I don't believe that {2.SimFirstName} is that bad of a person.
Are we talking about the same person? {2.SimFirstName} and I have a great relationship, so please knock it off.
I can't stand to listen to this anymore. In case you weren't aware, {2.SimFirstName} and I are extremely close; stop bad mouthing {F2.her}{M2.him}!
Woah {0.SimFirstName}, you're talking about one of my best friends here; cut it out!
{M2.He}{F2.She} doesn’t sound that interesting.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I've already made up my mind about {2.SimFirstName}. Every time we're together we continue to despise each other a little more.
{2.SimFirstName} and I aren't on the best of terms right now, I don't think that's a good idea.
About that... {2.SimFirstName} and I constantly bicker, I'd rather not provoke that even further.
Sorry {0.SimFirstName}, but I'm way too busy at the moment to spend any time getting to know {2.SimFirstName} better.
After hearing what you had to say, I'm not feeling very inclined to chat with {2.SimFirstName}. I think I'll pass this time!
I don't know. {2.SimFirstName}? You're not very convincing.
What are you talking about? We’re in love!
We don't need your opinion about our relationship, thank you very much!
Who are you to tell me what to do? I love {2.SimFirstName} and you won't change that!
You’re right, I can do so much better than {M2.him}{F2.her}. I’m going to break up with {2.SimFirstName} tonight.
Really? I guess we are not that great of a couple. I should just end it already.
You are right, {2.SimFirstName} and I are not a good fit for each other after all. I will talk to {F2.her}{M2.him}.

Everything does not seem to be going {0.SimFirstName}'s way at all lately. It has just been bad news after bad news.
