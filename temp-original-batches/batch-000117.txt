Perfect Tan
{0.SimFirstName} is &lt;i&gt;flawlessly&lt;/i&gt; sunkissed! No tan-lines for {F0.her}{M0.him}!
Skinny Dip
Swimming in the nude is so much more fun when everyone is doing it with you! 
Sand &lt;i&gt;Everywhere&lt;/i&gt;
Okay... maybe clothes are good for some things—like keeping the sand out of places it shouldn't be! Ugh.
Coarse and Rough!
Getting sand in places it shouldn't be is irritating. Putting clothes over that and rubbing it in—&lt;b&gt;way worse&lt;/b&gt;!
Risky Business
What could enhance the art of dance as much as losing one's pants?
Oh, Natural!
Where better to celebrate one's natural form than outside?

Spas heal the body and mind. Why would {0.SimFirstName} let clothes come between {F0.her}{M0.him} and &lt;i&gt;ultimate&lt;/i&gt; tranquility? 
Natural Form
{0.SimFirstName} is feeling particularly inspired while viewing art and celebrating {F0.her}{M0.his} own natural form. After all, the body is perhaps the greatest masterpiece of all.

In My Element
This feels more natural. Clothes are weird anyways.
Have Some Decency
Some Sims have no shame. How awkward for them to be seen in such a state...
Sims These Days!
Back when {0.SimFirstName} was a young Sim, nobody would have been so uncouth as to behave in this manner! &lt;i&gt;How indecent&lt;/i&gt;! 
Getting Buff
{0.SimFirstName} is pretty sure {F0.she's}{M0.he's} getting a better workout than usual, and if not... seeing &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is a great motivator!
Ewww!
{0.SimFirstName} saw &lt;i&gt;Sim-things&lt;/i&gt; that can't be unseen. How icky!
Seen Some Stuff
For once, {0.SimFirstName} is glad {F0.her}{M0.his} eyesight isn't what it used to be! &lt;i&gt;Unfortunately,&lt;/i&gt; now it's too late for {F0.her}{M0.his} appetite as well...
Eh, Why Not?
This isn't the sort of thing {0.SimFirstName} normally does, but all that drinkin' has {F0.her}{M0.him} thinkin'...
Daring Diner
What a silly situation! {0.SimFirstName} is having a blast (and a few laughs) with this new dining &lt;i&gt;experience&lt;/i&gt;.

What a rush! It's exhilarating to spend a public meal showing it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; off! 
There's something empowering about going out in public, having a nice meal—all in the nude. 
Burnt Bits
Is it sanitary? Not really. Is it safe? Nope. Maybe some things (like cooking) are a little better &lt;i&gt;suited&lt;/i&gt; for clothes...
Birthday Suit
{0.SimFirstName} came into this world in the buff. What fun to celebrate {F0.her}{M0.his} special day in such a similar way! 
Bracing Breezes
The fresh air really makes this a great place to work out.

Takin' a lickin' from a villain leaves any Sim dazed.
Spend Time Outdoors
