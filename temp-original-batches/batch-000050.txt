Make Acarajé
Acarajé is a stuffed fritter made out of a dough blend of black eyed peas, salt, pepper, and onions, and is sold as a street food in Bahia, Brazil.\n\nAcarajés were introduced by the Baianas, who are prominent figures of Bahia's history. These women are the descendants of slave women who sold their Acarajés as a means of buying their freedom or that of a family member. Later on, they sold them as a source of income.\n\nThis dish, and the Baianas, are an important symbol of Bahia's African roots and everything surrounding it, are traditions that have been carefully maintained for many generations.\n\nLactose Free
