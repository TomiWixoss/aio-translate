The writers {0.SimFirstName} help out  thanked {F0.her}{M0.him} for helping add to the comic's world history and lore. The content provided helped them cement where they wanted the series to go for the next three years. Now {0.SimFirstName} just has to wait until the next arc of the comic begins to see how their ideas are used.
{0.SimFirstName}'s contributions to the extended universe inspired the series writers to start a new comic arc focusing on the characters and content {F0.she}{M0.he} developed. Solstice Comics expressed a desire to work with {0.SimFirstName} again in the future, backing this statment with a sizable bonus.
&quot;Dear {F0.madam}{M0.sir}, Solstice comics is sorry to inform you that the project you were contracted to work on has been cancelled due to missed deadlines and work flow issues. We thank you for the time spent working hard on our award winning comics and will reach out if we wish to procure your talents for another contract.&quot;
{0.SimName} took all the elements of the dystopian, hopeless world and made the cold equations necessary to write a futuristic story of escaping the futuristic prison city of San Myshuno. The chapters went well, offering a near total recall of what made the series great to begin with. The client was impressed, and might bring {F0.her}{M0.him} back for the third in the series.
{0.SimName} volunteered as tribute, taking the task of writing about the scrappy group's struggles against the evil empire to heart. After no less than 451 pages of scorching wordsmithing, {F0.she}{M0.he} took the series in a brand new, darker direction. Having done so well, {F0.she}{M0.he} left room for the heroes' new hope, but the government will strike back. The client may yet ask {F0.her}{M0.him} to return for another chapter!
Not all writing is gold. {0.SimName}'s approaches to enhance the story didn't make the cut. Their notes suggest that adding an abundance of pop-culture references don't make it more dystopian, but {F0.she}{M0.he} won't be discouraged. There's always the next gig, and the next series reboot.
City Hall officials are in unanimous agreement that {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed mural is the winner and will soon be created in the Main Street district. They've taken the step of installing an honorary plaque on a nearby bench bearing {M0.his}{F0.her} name.
City Hall officials are in such love with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposal for the Main Street district mural, that in addition to giving {M0.him}{F0.her} a bonus payment, they've taken the extraordinary step of renaming Main Street to {0.SimName} Boulevard!
City Hall officials are disappointed that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to complete a proposal for a Main Street district in time. {M0.He}{F0.She} received a partial payment for completing a portion of the gig's goals.
{0.SimFirstName} strode into City Hall with {M0.his}{F0.her} proposed electrical box art, looking forward to the opportunity to present {M0.his}{F0.her} vision for artwork on every city street corner. The reality was decidedly less exciting, as a government employee momentarily glanced at {0.SimFirstName}'s proposal before handing over a check. Oh well, at least the pay was good!
The city council board was radiating excitement over {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed electrical box art! They were effusive with their praise, and even the mayor {M0.herself}{F0.himself} shook {0.SimFirstName}'s hand in a photo op for the press.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the submission process for the city's electrical box art program by the required deadline. As expected with any government contract though, {M0.he}{F0.she} still collected a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} expected payment.
The Sims Transportation Administration is pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed airport terminal mural. On top of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay, they gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a coupon to skip the security line on {M0.his}{F0.her} next flight.
The Sims Transportation Administration is thrilled with the mural that {0.SimFirstName} proposed, and can't wait until its brought to life within the airport terminal. Not only did {M0.he}{F0.she} earn bonus pay, but they all chipped in to buy {0.SimFirstName} a lifetime pass to the airport's first class lounge - how swanky!
The Sims Transportation Administration is unhappy that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the gig's requirements within the allotted time. {M0.He}{F0.She} received some pay for the partial work completed, but don't be surprised if {M0.he}{F0.she} gets pulled out of the security line for a &quot;random&quot; pat down next time {M0.he}{F0.she} takes a flight.
You've done very well. Our users did not seem to notice a difference between your proofreading and the Alpha tests run by our A.I. development group.
Our customer satisfaction score has increased by 10 points just from your hire. You've done so well that we are rethinking our investment in AI grammar correction. We've got a new idea to disrupt this industry. A app that instantly connects you with trained proofreaders. We will just take a modest cut of the profits.
When we asked you to proofread user submission for grammar errors. Instead you replaced all emotional adjectives with emoji's, and failed to complete the full breadth of your assigned tasks.. Please do not apply here again.
&quot;Thanks for all you're help! While I didn't get my dream job, I ended up with a full time position as Pneumatic Device and Machine Optimizer which will get me the experience I need to land my dream in a year or two! PS. I just realized that my position is just a fancy way of saying factory worker...&quot;
&quot;I can't thank you enough, with you're help I landed the job! Finally I can spend my days as a Teddy Bear Surgeon helping heal all the well loved plushies of the world. P.S. I'm also taking classes to help woth my spelling. Really got to work on that.&quot;
&quot;What happened? the deadline for submiting applications passed and I had to go with what I already had. Hopefully not having a second pear of eye on my work won't hurt my chances.&quot;
“{0.SimFirstName}, with your help the thesis was submitted error-free. Now we wait for the eggheads to determine if the research merits me receiving the title of “Doctor”. Hopefully, they don’t get stuck on the failed study into turning ants into viable arena gladiators for entertainment purposes. Don’t know how Steve convinced me they were a good idea. I really don’t.” 
“Due to your impeccable eye for the smallest of spelling infractions and my years of studying chemically attracted Formicidae, my team and I have been awarded with the prestigious Kroncke Award for Biology. Guess what? That means we’re published, and I'll be receiving that doctorate. See that Dad, you said I wasn’t smart enough! Look at me now!” \n Along with the contract's payment, the client included a bonus for the extra effort {0.SimFirstName} put in.
“Hey, deadline’s passed. Got the ants to do some of the proofreading before submitting the paper since I never heard back from you. Just hoping they didn’t modify my notes to put them in a better light when I wasn’t looking. Payment for you time included.”
With {M0.her}{F0.his} dying breath, the octogenarian transferred the agreed upon payment to {0.SimFirstName}'s account. Seems like {0.SimFirstName} finished the portrait just in the nick of time? RIP to them; hopefully their family enjoys the painting.
{0.SimFirstName} submitted what could only be described as a stunning likeness of {M0.his}{F0.her} client, who was said to be so pleased that they hopped out of their deathbed and burst into an impromptu smustle. Pleasing an octogenarian has its benefits; the client included an extra bonus payment for a job well done.
{0.SimFirstName}'s procrastination in completing the portrait gig did not pay off. It would seem the client passed away while waiting for {0.SimFirstName} to complete {M0.his}{F0.her} work. An estate lawyer did transfer a portion of the gig's payment for the work that {0.SimFirstName} did manage to complete.
The client was pleased to see the portrait of a departed loved one rendered so faithfully by {0.SimFirstName}. The restless spirit in question seemed quite appreciative as well, as {M0.she}{F0.he} popped out of {M0.her}{F0.his} urn to give a nod of approval. 
The client began to openly weep on receipt of the portrait... {0.SimFirstName} created such a lifelike rendering of their recently departed loved one, that they immediately felt a close bond to the painting. In fact, they swear that the eyes in the painting follow them each time they walk by. It's hard to put a price on what's sure to be a treasured item in the client's family, but they managed to do just that, when they expressed their thanks by paying {0.SimFirstName} a nice bonus on top of the portrait's agreed upon price.
A cold chill ran through {0.SimFirstName}'s body, as the deadline for completing the portrait came and went. It seems the spirit realm is unhappy with {M0.his}{F0.her} lack of commitment to aiding in the remembrance of a family's loved one.
The politician is quite pleased with the portrait {0.SimFirstName} created, and even expunged some jaywalking fines from {0.SimFirstName}'s record as a small sign of thanks.
A beautifully rendered portrait may just be the start of something bigger for {0.SimFirstName}... The politician is so pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} work that {M0.she's}{F0.he's} promised to share {0.SimFirstName}'s name to other up and coming public servants who need their own portraits painted. {M0.She}{F0.He} even diverted a little bonus from a slush fund {0.SimFirstName}'s way!
The politician is pretty unhappy that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the assigned tasks by the agreed upon time. {M0.She'll}{F0.He'll} never admit it, but a proposal {M0.she}{F0.he} introduced to slash the public art budget seemed like a clear retaliatory response to {0.SimFirstName}'s lackadaisical approach to {M0.his}{F0.her} work.
Writing a by the numbers, literal interpretation of the events and thoughts the guru spoke to, {0.SimFirstName} completed the work to light praise.
{0.SimFirstName} took notes, writing down the events of the guru's experiences and thoughts on inner peace. A little bit of enlightenment must have rubbed off on {F0.her}{M0.him} because the client was very happy with the results.
{0.SimFirstName} just sort of wrote whatever came to mind during the long periods of silence when working with the guru. Finding the results unsatisfactory, the client suggested that {F0.she}{M0.he} find their peace and happiness elsewhere, paying a portion of the agreed amount.
“This partnership has been rather satisfactory. Normally, I dread dealing directly with dolti… the general public. The Scientific Research Publication should be shipping out our work in the next few weeks and expect it to become a standard text-book in my field.”
“Exemplary! it’s almost like writing for nitwi… non-scientific individuals is your calling. I must say, translating the absence of privileged reference frames in general relativity into something palatable for a five-year old must be some sort of cabalistic gift! Next time I’m in need of a writer, I’ll be sure to reach out. Oh, I’ve included something extra for your marvelous work.”
Failing to meet the project deadline, {0.SimFirstName} got a heavily self-censored email from their irate client. Seems the deadline was to get the work published and missing this has greatly affected the client’s standing in the scientific community. Though {0.SimFirstName} got paid for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, it wasn’t the full contracted amount.
{0.SimFirstName} took the draft and corrected it, fixing the portions that were written in stream-of-consciousness, fixing the perspective from second to third, and turning the first-person lines into quotes. {F0.She}{M0.He} still isn't sure {F0.she}{M0.he} understands the philosophical implications, but the client is happy!
{0.SimFirstName} reworked the drafts, tied the ideas together, and maybe learned a little about the philosophy of perspective and existence! The client was very, very pleased with himself. Or pleased with {0.SimFirstName}, depending on perspective.
Unable to make heads or tails of who the client was talking about as it went from first, to third, back to second-perspective in his writings, the contract was canceled out of frustration. A paltry sum of simoleons was still paid out however.
&quot;Did you remember to go over &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the notes?&quot; the client asked over and over. After reading through the drafts and finalizing the text book, the schools happily distribute the new text book.
The client is elated with the history text book, and so are the schools it'll be used in. Grades across the district are up, test scores are improving, and the students have a new appreciation for history. {0.SimFirstName} didn't just do a good job, they helped society remember where they came from!
{0.SimFirstName} didn't write a text book so much as a stream of consciousness manuscript. The client makes a note of how it feels more like an opinion piece, and politely thanks {F0.her}{M0.him} for their help, but explains they will take it from here.
Slater Publishing was happy with the narrative {0.SimFirstName} provided. A solid crime thriller with a compelling protagonist. Now {0.SimFirstName} just needed to wait for the story to be published to see how much the masses enjoyed the mystery.
The case was closed; Sleuths and Scofflaws had their cover story. The narrative was inventive; the criminal inspired. Now was time for silent reflection and a juice, straight. Suddenly, a notification appeared on the screen the author kept in the corner of {F0.her}{M0.his} eye. With a single press of a button the notice illuminated the virtual landscape before them. Gratuity from Slater Publishing, most appreciated, told of a client well satisfied. In a post script, an ask to delve into another conundrum. But {0.SimFirstName} needed {F0.her}{M0.his} rest. Time to calm the mind before burrowing back into the muck and grime of another investigation.
The deadline passed, the criminal got away and the client pulled the plug. Though {0.SimFirstName} was compensated for {F0.her}{M0.his} time with the investigation, {F0.she}{M0.he} didn’t feel satisfied. The puzzle was incomplete, the tale went cold. Surly it couldn’t stop here! But it would, and {0.SimFirstName} would have to return to their other mundane writings for now. For even the best sometimes get lost in the fog.
The caper and the crime have been committed; {0.SimFirstName} sent off the manuscript and the client thought it was a &quot;good start,&quot; and are happy with what {F0.she}{M0.he} crafted for them.
The series is selling so well it feels like stealing. {0.SimFirstName} received a series of accolades and more than a few quirked eyebrows wondering if {F0.she}{M0.he} has been thinking about how to build {F0.her}{M0.his} criminal empire long before taking this gig...
The only crime committed here is the writing, or so the client says. {0.SimFirstName}'s initial drafts were found wanting. {F0.She}{M0.He} will still get paid for the first part of the contract, but has been asked not to contrive any other capers for them at the moment.
{0.SimFirstName} searched and searched, studying the sheet music and finding the names of the companies that distributed it. Turning over all the same stones previous investigations did, {F0.she}{M0.he} didn't manage to find any new information, but did present it in a new way.
{0.SimFirstName} wrote a treatise on the song, analyzing the harmonic patterns, checking to see if the notes spelled any words, and digging through so many old files. The public responded well to {F0.her}{M0.his} findings, riveted by every word -- even though it raised more questions than it answered.
The client mysteriously ended the contract with {0.SimFirstName} after the first outline was sent off. With no feedback, {F0.she}{M0.he} thinks it best to let the mystery rest for now. At least {F0.she}{M0.he} got a small paycheck out of it.
{0.SimFirstName} got a good review on the motivational book, the client calling it &quot;more than adequate&quot; as {F0.she}{M0.he} helped push it over the finish line.
&quot;Oh wow, why didn't I think of this? It's brilliant! I'm going to go start my next book right now!&quot; the client said of the writing {0.SimFirstName} did in helping finish the motivational book. Having inspired the motivational speaker to take the next steps, the book itself does very well!
Upon reading the draft work {0.SimFirstName} had been working on, the client found themselves compelled to complete the book on their own. In this way, {0.SimFirstName} inspired and motivated someone... just at the expense of the contract. {F0.She}{M0.He} will be compensated for the work they've done so far, however.
Upon reformatting the last of the client’s incoherent thoughts on employment, {0.SimFirstName} submitted the final draft and sat back. Almost immediately, the client messaged back, pleased with the overall work. Once they finished reading everything over once more the book would be off to the publisher and then into the hands of the masses. {0.SimFirstName} was about to influence many to reach for their dreams of being self-employed.
“This book hits the nail on the head! People really needed to not only learn to see the opportunities around them but also understand the problems they’d face pursuing their new path of self-employment! For all your work, I’m giving you a cut of the signing bonus the publisher offered. You’re the embodiment of my philosophy on self-employment. It’s almost like you took all my ideas to heart.”
“I don’t think you’re cut out for this ‘Self-Employed’ craze I’m about to bring to the world. You didn’t follow steps four through seven yourself, failing to meet the goals we set. Just remember steps twenty nine and seventy two {0.SimFirstName}, they’ll help you bounce back from this setback but only if you put your mind to it. I’m forwarding pay for what you did finish; it will help me inspire someone better suited to motivating themselves.”
The mod was delivered, and after a bit of testing and verification, released to the community. High fives all around! Well, virtual high fives, since everyone works remotely. The modding group thanked {0.SimFirstName} for {F0.her}{M0.his} help and continued their vacations. Now about that missing modder...
The mod was very timely delivered. The modding group was so relieved that they gave {0.SimFirstName} a bit extra! Now everyone can enjoy their vacations in peace. Sort of. Unfortunately, the missing modder still hasn't been heard from...
{0.SimFirstName} didn't give the modding group anything complete, but they still gave a small portion of the promised pay out of good will. They said something about modders needing to support each other. What a nice bunch!
It sure is a mod... for a game... Yep. With all the criteria satisfied, {0.SimFirstName} received the promised payment. The organizers couldn't help but express a little disappointment at the bugginess of the mod, but it was a tight deadline after all.
Well, that was quite fast. The organizers complimented {0.SimFirstName} on a speedy delivery, claiming it's rare that such a quickly made mod works so seamlessly with the original game. Apparently, that's worth a bonus! Where do they get all this money...?
