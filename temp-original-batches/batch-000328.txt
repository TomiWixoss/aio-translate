Hi {1.SimFirstName}! We're going off the grid! We're moving out and giving up all technology, including phones. Thanks for all the memories. I'll be thinking of you while I'm foraging in the deep forest.
Sorry, no thank you! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} can be interested in some of Trashley's Boxes instead of Trashley?
Sorry, Trashley too busy with business. Instead of thinking about Trashley, {0.SimFirstName} should think about buying from store!
What's my problem?! My problem is YOU! I'm still furious with you, &lt;i&gt;in case it wasn't clear&lt;/i&gt;.
I am so done with your nonsense. You have the audacity to wonder why I'm still furious... Unbelievable!
Why don't you just leave me alone? I'm furious enough with you already! End of conversation?
My problem is I'm dealing with passive aggressive questions from someone who I find infuriating after everything they've done. Now who do you think that is?
Just let me stew in my bitterness in peace. Some things are hard to forget or forgive, &lt;i&gt;okay&lt;/i&gt;?
You shouldn't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to ask. You could say I'm &lt;i&gt;a little&lt;/i&gt; bitter.
I really don't like you very much right now. Just feeling bitter over a few things that I'll get over eventually... Or not.
Hey, this drama isn't my fault... at least not completely. I'm allowed to feel bitter about what's happened between us.
I'm so grateful we could work things out! I know how hard it was to give this another chance, but I won't let you down. I promise.

It really means a lot to me that you make time for me. Just wanted to let you know.
Sentiment Gained
You make my day so much better! Thanks for making me smile.
You're so fun to be around! I really enjoy spending time with you, and I hope you feel that way about me, too.
I'm glad you don't think my llama jokes are getting old. I feel like you just get me.
Sentiment Gained
You are my hero! I promise I won't forget that I owe my life to your heroic actions.
Ahhhhhhh! Am I still... alive? Oh... I am! I guess you saved me, huh? Thank you so much! Seriously. Yikes. That was close. I owe you big time!
Wow, you literally just saved my life! Words can't even begin to describe how grateful I am. Really. I won't forget this!
