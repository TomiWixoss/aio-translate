After a few tries, {0.SimFirstName} stumbles on the right formula to automate the entire trajectory-calculating process. {M0.He}{F0.She} completes the task sooner than expected, and shares {M0.his}{F0.her} secret with the rest of the team. 
There’s a whole warehouse full of extra panels, so {0.SimFirstName} grabs some new ones and installs them. The old ones will make a nice new foosball table for the staff’s break room.

Abort! Abort! The rocket was programmed to land on soft cheese, but instead landed on hard rock! This was an understandable miscalculation, but nonetheless the ship is crippled; the landing back home might be a bit tricky...
{0.SimFirstName} is getting nowhere. The alien's explanation is as half-baked as the one before, possibly even quarter-baked. {M0.He}{F0.She} decides this is {M0.his}{F0.her} chance and lunges for the animal.
Ah, that's better. See? {0.SimFirstName}'s fine. If {M0.he}{F0.she} really had Space Madness {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} start to panic randomly and make really bad decisions. OH NO!! The rocket's too HEAVY!! {0.SimFirstName} should start ejecting things immediately!
Deciding it must be a trap, {0.SimFirstName} cruises on, but soon {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel starts to run low. The radar still hasn’t picked up anything but the planet on the map. {0.SimFirstName} has little choice. Re-directing {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, {M0.he}{F0.she} lands in front of a lone tree growing on a cliff. The opening to a small tunnel lies beneath it. Go in?
That safest way to travel! As the drives activate, a flash of light flips the time polarity! {0.SimFirstName} is going the right way again, and needs to keep the time-stream intact! What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?!
The reptilians guide {0.SimFirstName} out of the nebula, but then come around to board {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket! Two towering Iguanoids pry open the hatch and rummage through {M0.his}{F0.her} things. Apparently {0.SimFirstName} doesn't have anything of value to them. They smash some panels and leave {0.SimFirstName} to {M0.his}{F0.her} broken devices.
Why slow down now? Fully engaging {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters, {0.SimFirstName} easily ditches the patrol. 4 Eyes is over the literal moon with excitement, but {0.SimFirstName} knows it's time to take {M0.his}{F0.her} friend home. {M0.He}{F0.She} even receives a nice reward from its mom as thanks. What a crazy Flea Market day!
Reversing back through the flotsam, the rocket drifts like a time-salmon against the relentless river of causality until it is surrounded by wreckage. What happened here?
By showing {M0.his}{F0.her} softer side, {0.SimFirstName} has won back the respect of the people, but obviously this &quot;alien overlord&quot; stuff isn't exactly {M0.his}{F0.her} strong suit. &quot;It's not you, it's me,&quot; {M0.he}{F0.she} tells the panicked aliens, heading back to {M0.his}{F0.her} ship.
The instant {0.SimFirstName} picks up a talisman, the ground starts rumbling. It’s a trap! Covering {M0.his}{F0.her} head, {M0.he}{F0.she} bolts from the temple just as the walls give way. {M0.He}{F0.She} makes it to {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and manages to get it airborne, but the ship has suffered critical damage. Although {0.SimFirstName} got {M0.his}{F0.her} artifact, this is going to be a rough landing.
{0.SimFirstName} comes across a purple specimen that seems to be breathing! Or maybe quivering? It's hard to tell, but it's moving at least. Suddenly, {M0.he}{F0.she} feels the whole ship shudder and rumble. Keep looking, or leave now?
“Don’t shoot! We surrender.” The Rebel leader doesn’t even have shoes, let alone weapons. {0.SimFirstName} is almost disappointed {M0.his}{F0.her} job is so easily completed! {M0.He}{F0.She} brings Yang Holmby the news and is rewarded handsomely for doing the government’s dirty work.
{0.SimFirstName} has never been violently ousted, but it doesn't sound like much fun, even when the subjects are nearly microscopic. {M0.He}{F0.She} beats a hasty exit and the aliens rejoice!
{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the station which is unusually dark. {M0.He}{F0.She} flips on a flashlight and is startled by a disheveled-looking astronaut. &quot;Thank goodness you came! Our main power coupling is shot. Is there anything you can do to help?&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} notices an odd, green-colored creature shaped like a plumbob. It doesn't seem to have realized that {0.SimFirstName} was nearby. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to communicate with it or watch quietly from a distance?
{0.SimFirstName} pries open the box and is nearly blinded by the glowing treasure inside! Better get it back quick. {0.SimFirstName} is trying to heave the heavy box onto {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulders when {M0.he}{F0.she} senses someone watching {0.SimPronounObjective}. Looking up, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees not two eyes, but hundreds. {0.SimFirstName} can try to explain {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of this, or run like crazy.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to attack a band of ruthless space pirates with {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Immediately they point the hugest, most scary-looking space cannon {0.SimFirstName}'s ever seen directly at {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and press FIRE. An ion beam surges into the prow of the ship. It begins belching a thick purple smoke, and {0.SimFirstName} has to retreat for home.
{0.SimFirstName} is suddenly feeling anxious and jumpy. There's a strange tingling sensation in {M0.his}{F0.her} hands and feet, and {M0.he}{F0.she} feels a little light-headed. Could {M0.he}{F0.she} have Space Madness?? Could be something wrong with the air flow...?
{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the satellite and notices it’s covered in a light pink goop! But why?! What… is … it?
{0.SimFirstName} is nearing the sun when {M0.he}{F0.she} spies an immense flying saucer with a jolly-looking alien wedged into the cockpit. The alien is manipulating some kind of phase beam to fire asteroids directly into the sun. As each asteroid hits, the sun flares and the alien laughs. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
In the distance, {0.SimFirstName} sees another ship blast its trash out the airlock - now all that space debris is hurtling {0.SimFirstName}’s way! A rusty waffle iron strikes {M0.his}{F0.her} craft and tears a hole in the fuselage. {0.SimFirstName} is sucked out into deep space! {M0.He}{F0.She} takes a moment to be thankful {M0.he}{F0.she} put on {M0.his}{F0.her} full space suit today. Now what?
Right! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} explores the debris and finds a treasure! Avoiding the time-edge, {F0.she}{M0.he} can safely return home!
Good thing {0.SimFirstName} has an expanded cargo bay. It's a lot of stuff to move (old concert tees, milk crate furniture, blacklight posters), but it all fits in pretty easily, and they blast off for Rompiter. The alien is so grateful, he gives {0.SimFirstName} his least-dirty futon mattress as thanks. {0.SimFirstName} incinerates it.
While tumbling head over heels, {0.SimFirstName} somehow manages to grab onto one of the ship's fins, and {M0.he}{F0.she} gradually pulls {M0.himself}{F0.herself} back into the ship. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s not floating  away into nothingness (which is good!), but {M0.his}{F0.her} ship still has a giant hole in the side (which is less good). What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?
&quot;See, when you say threatening things, it makes me feel very unsafe,&quot; says {0.SimFirstName}. Good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} watched all those episodes of Celeb Talk Therapy on TV - {M0.he}{F0.she} knows the lingo! The pirates have a breakthrough and leave to go apologize to their mothers. They even leave {0.SimFirstName} a few bucks for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble.
While cruising comfortably somewhere in the vicinity of the Vega Startron, {0.SimFirstName} sees a banged-up escape pod drifting out of orbit. Lights are flickering - maybe something's inside? If {M0.he}{F0.she} brings it on board {M0.his}{F0.her}  ship, {M0.he}{F0.she} can see what it is. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could just use it for spare parts.
{0.SimFirstName} recalls a nifty trick. Pursing {M0.his}{F0.her} lips, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets out a shrill alien mating cry. The egomaniac pilot turns 2 eyes on the horizon and 1 on his mirror, losing sight of {0.SimFirstName} just long enough. {0.SimFirstName} lands another hit, tying the score as the clock runs out. Impressed, the alien says they should fight again soon. {0.SimFirstName} heads proudly home.
That's one small step for Sim, one slightly awkward, lunging step for Sim-kind. {0.SimFirstName} explores the lunar seas, the lunar rocks, and the other lunar rocks. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes some for the trip home.
So much for a change of scene. {0.SimFirstName} has no sooner landed than a government official waves {M0.him}{F0.her} in to see Yang Holmby, the Emperor. It isn’t easy to understand him through all his spluttering, but he insists that {0.SimFirstName} menace the colonists into submission. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} agree?
{0.SimFirstName}’s upgraded ship makes quick work of this arrogant extraterrestrial. Humbled by {0.SimFirstName}’s skill, the alien offers {0.SimPronounObjective} a reward beyond {M0.his}{F0.her} wildest imaginings! {0.SimFirstName} blasts home with {M0.his}{F0.her} prize before the alien can reconsider.
Well, there were no listening devices that {0.SimFirstName} could find. Good. The government agents don't seem to have tracked {M0.him}{F0.her}...so far. But {0.SimFirstName} needs to be sure.
Touchdown! The beagle has landed! {0.SimFirstName} is now safely on the moon. Should {F0.she}{M0.he} send out the scientific-looking probe, or get out there and explore the surface for {F0.her}{M0.him}self?
When the aliens see {0.SimFirstName} looming over them, they immediately fall to their knees and start chanting - they obviously think {M0.he's}{F0.she's} some sort of supreme being come to rule them. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} stick around a while, or just be on {M0.his}{F0.her} way?
{0.SimFirstName} pulls up to the extermination station drive-thru and begins to explain the situation to the guys at the window. Unfortunately, the sobbing has gotten louder—MUCH louder. Unconvinced that {0.SimFirstName} has a sobbing rat on board, they refuse to help. Now what?
Wooh! Free jewels! {0.SimFirstName} snatches the valuable rocks as the crowd gives a standing ovation to {M0.his}{F0.her} prudent sense of value. “The creature had passed the trials! May {M0.his}{F0.her} species flourish and grow!” {M0.he}{F0.she} hears, before being materialized safely back in {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, already nearing home.
From the swamp, {0.SimFirstName} pulls some kind of fish. The creature smiles. “Typically given only during a mating ritual, this is,” he says, “but ignore that for now, I will.” The final trial is to explore the Evil Cave. The creature gives {0.SimFirstName} a weapon, then oddly stresses that {M0.he}{F0.she} will not need it.
Ugh, NOW the aliens are angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for ignoring them. Don't they understand that {0.SimFirstName}'s just not the murdering type? Being a deity really is a lose-lose proposition. {0.SimFirstName}'s so frustrated with their pettiness that {M0.he}{F0.she} just leaves. What a waste of time.
Yeehaw! Nothing like a wide-eyed kid to make {0.SimFirstName} feel like a hero. And with four eyes the effect is doubled! After a speedrace around Planet Toomootoo and a few stellar flips, {M0.he}{F0.she} deposits 4 Eyes at home and receives a nice reward from its mom.
{0.SimFirstName} hails Tech Support on the comm. A recorded voice says, &quot;Your call is important to us. We will be with you within one galactic cycle.&quot; A galactic cycle is a measurement of time equal to 394 Sim years. Infuriating music plays.
{0.SimFirstName} fires {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's blasters at the creature, which immediately shatters into a bajillion pieces. {0.SimFirstName} gathers some of the pieces and leaves, quickly.
{0.SimFirstName} takes aim with the standard cannons and attempts to shoot off the goop! It seemed to work a little bit as some of the pink substance floats off into space, but that could have been a disaster.
