A pack’s values define its identity and the expected behavior of each member. Following the values will help you rise up the ranks. Ignore them long enough and you’ll be put on Probation. All values must be returned to good standing in order to end the probationary period. Continue to disregard the values and you risk discipline and may even be kicked out!

&lt;b&gt;Paying with Household Funds&lt;/b&gt;\nTuition is taken from the Sim's household funds.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Paying with Student Loan&lt;/b&gt;\nTuition is paid with a loan that the Sim will owe. The money owed is the Total Cost + Interest.\n\nLoan information will appear in the Phone's Household panel under the Make Loans Payment option.
Sims may choose to live in university housing. This places Sims on campus, living with other non-playable roommates also attending university. Housing costs will be paid per term, and Sims are encouraged to bring everything they may need for university in their personal inventory before moving, as they will not be able to alter university housing directly once moved in. Student essentials will still be available to purchase at kiosks on the university campus.
Sims choosing to live off campus will move out of their current house and into another, allowing them to move in with other households or buy a new home. If the Sim intends to purchase a new place, it is prudent to give them enough funds to do so. Note that cancelling during Move Out will place your Sim in the My Households bin.
