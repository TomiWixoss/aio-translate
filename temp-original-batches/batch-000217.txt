Tree Adventure
This trunk is a lot bigger than anticipated!  It's dark… but somehow not scary.  A faint glow is the only light, a rolling burble the only sound.
The mist is warm and friendly, as far as mists go.  Without warning, {0.SimFirstName} feels the sensation of being spun around, an exit to the cave now staring {M0.him}{F0.her} in the face.
Having barely missed the mist, {0.SimFirstName} is in the clear, but thoroughly disoriented. {M0.He}{F0.She} scrambles about, eventually crawling towards the cavernous trunk's entrance.
{0.SimFirstName} delves a bit deeper, and a bit darker.  A soft splash tells {M0.him}{F0.her} that {M0.he}{F0.she} has just stepped into a shallow stream.
Taking the path of least resistance, and hoping that it doesn't terminate at a sewer main, {0.SimFirstName} is distracted by an ethereal  mist, glowing ominously.
{0.SimFirstName} follows the light, all too soon realizing that it was coming from the very place where {M0.he}{F0.she} entered.
{0.SimFirstName} trudges up a slight slope, with only the gentle resistance of current to guide {M0.him}{F0.her}.  Soon, however, everything dries up.  Without light or direction, {M0.he}{F0.she} is wandering blind.

Explore The Mystical Magic Bean Portal Tree
{0.SimFirstName} stepped into the portal, expecting darkness, but was instead greeted by a bright sunny pasture, filled with all kinds of flora.\n\nA tree stood off to one side, glowing and bearing fruit.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} plucked a fruit from the tree, and immediately found the sunny landscape disintegrate into darkness. Before {M0.he}{F0.she} knew it, {M0.he}{F0.she} had stepped out of the tree's portal with something in {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket.
We're sorry, but the portal is currently closed. Please try again at 10am when we will again open our door to the public. We appreciate your attention, and hope to see you within our branches soon.\n\n-Portal Management Services

Return to Cave Entrance
Step onto the Ledge
The switchback leads {0.SimFirstName} up and down a dank corridor, around a bend, and through a particularly confined tunnel.  {0.SimFirstName} is back at the entrance!
No need to try something dangerous!  {0.SimFirstName} creeps down the main branch, and spies through the dim remaining light a switchback headed gradually up, and a rickety ladder headed down.
Exploring Cave
{0.SimFirstName}, ever the intrepid explorer, sets out to spelunk the cave. There are two pathways.  The narrower of the two is a bit stalac-tight, but {0.SimFirstName} stalag-might fit if {M0.he}{F0.she} squeezes.
A soft mossy path leads {0.SimFirstName} effortlessly onward, until {M0.he}{F0.she} spies the entranceway to a beautiful grotto.
{0.SimFirstName} carefully plunges into a black abyss, groping {M0.his}{F0.her} way along splintery rungs. After a long descent, a faint azure light starts to fill the expanse below. {M0.He}{F0.She} can step off onto a dim mossy precipice, or continue into the blue.
The dark, winding fissure proves too difficult to navigate.  {0.SimFirstName} quickly becomes stymied and frustrated.
Seemingly infinite rungs take {0.SimFirstName} down, and down, and down.  After an exhausting while, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to retreat, lest {M0.he}{F0.she} get stuck down there forever...
