Tough Assignment
Distracting Napper
One of the students in the back of {0.SimFirstName}’s class has started to snore quietly. The teacher doesn’t seem to hear it but it’s getting distracting. Should {0.SimFirstName} just try harder to ignore it? Or should {M0.he}{F0.she} tell the teacher?
Stressed Teacher
The teacher has to run out and pick up his medication, so he asks the class to sit quietly and do their reading assignment while he’s gone. Should {0.SimFirstName} do that, or try to do some other homework while {M0.he}{F0.she} has the chance? 
Forgotten Lunch
{0.SimFirstName} forgot {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch today. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} out wandering the halls between classes, so {M0.he}{F0.she} could easily steal someone else’s out of their locker. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} do that, or just go hungry? 
Whoops! The client notices the similarities between the jingles, and so does everyone else. {0.SimFirstName} tries to play it like a deliberate spoof, but that only makes things worse. Luckily, the deodorant company agrees to drop their lawsuit once {M0.his}{F0.her} jingle is pulled from the air.
Everyone enjoyed {0.SimFirstName}’s set, but a couple of the judges are insisting that the gross-out act was the be-all and end-all of comedy. Ultimately they just flip a coin to determine the winner, but {0.SimFirstName} wins the toss!
Luckily the piano is somewhat concealed by two stately ferns and an elegantly sweeping staircase. Despite difficulty breathing and a steady pain in {M0. his gut}{F0.her ribs} {0.SimFirstName} plays moderately well and goes utterly unnoticed.
{0.SimFirstName} should have known that the world wasn’t ready for a cocky cauliflower. {M0.He}{F0.She} is rapidly replaced by a tamer vegetable, who knows {M0.his}{F0.her} place in the food chain.
Uh-oh. Mr. Funny Guy isn’t done. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} already has the crowd in {M0.his}{F0.her} back pocket! After one more try, the heckler leaves and {0.SimFirstName} rocks the mic.
