Dangerous Story
While researching a new story, {0.SimFirstName} gets the distinct impression {M0.he}{F0.she}’s being followed. While dying for a story would be good for {M0.his}{F0.her} legacy, {0.SimFirstName} would honestly rather not. Although {M0.he}{F0.she} feels like {M0.his}{F0.her} life is in danger, should {0.SimFirstName} keep digging, or back off?
Shocking Discovery
While researching {M0.his}{F0.her} next book, {0.SimFirstName} discovers something about a beloved historical figure that would shock the nation. If {M0.he}{F0.she} publishes it, {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes a legend, but it changes everything people thought they knew about history. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} publish it, or bury it?
News Show
In trying to promote {M0.his}{F0.her} latest book, {0.SimFirstName}’s publisher wants {0.SimPronounObjective} to appear on a news show with a host {M0.he}{F0.she} just can’t stand. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either grin and bear it on the program for the sake of sales, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can flat-out refuse.
Job Opening
There’s an opening for an opinion columnist on {0.SimFirstName}’s site. Readership has been falling, so {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to make sure to hire someone who will bring numbers up. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} hire a hot young writer who has big political opinions, or hire an experienced moderate?
A Fervent Wish
A sick little girl’s most fervent wish is to meet {0.SimFirstName}, her favorite author…and to find out what {0.SimFirstName}’s got planned for {M0.his}{F0.her} next book. Should {0.SimFirstName} share {M0.his}{F0.her} secrets, or stay tight-lipped?
Anonymous Source
One of {0.SimFirstName}’s stories draws the attention of the government, who wants the identity of {M0.his}{F0.her} anonymous source. They sound serious. {0.SimFirstName} can either divulge the source, even though {M0.he}{F0.she} promised them anonymity, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can keep quiet.
Out of Context
If {0.SimFirstName} takes a public figure’s statement just a little bit out of context, {M0.he}{F0.she}’ll get a great column out of it, even though {M0.he}{F0.she} knows it’s a stretch. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either run with it and hope {M0.his}{F0.her} readers agree with {0.SimPronounObjective}, or wait and hope that something more newsworthy comes along.
Terrible Assistant
{0.SimFirstName}’s terrible former assistant is claiming that he wrote huge portions of {0.SimFirstName}’s latest book. That assistant could barely get the coffee order right, but {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t want to be petty. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} tell the truth or say that the assistant “helped,” just to be nice?
An Awful Manuscript
The manuscript for the next volume in {0.SimFirstName}’s series is due soon…and it’s not exactly {M0.his}{F0.her} best work. In fact, it’s awful. Another writer has offered to help re-write it, as long as {0.SimFirstName} shares authoring credit. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either accept the help, or refuse it and publish the book with just {M0.his}{F0.her} own name on the cover.
Same Old Thing
Lately, all of {0.SimFirstName}’s stories have started to sound the same. They say variety is the spice of life, so maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could try mixing it up a bit. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try branching out into a new area of expertise, or just keep on doing the same thing? 
Political Endorsement
Whom should the paper endorse for political office? It’s {0.SimFirstName}’s call-she can either select the popular idealist who has no chance of winning, or {M0.he}{F0.she} can select the incumbent candidate who attends more fund-raisers and cocktail parties than meetings with constituents.
New Technology
{0.SimFirstName}’s publisher asks {0.SimPronounObjective} to release {M0.his}{F0.her} next book in a new electronic format-100 character bursts delivered every hour for 22 straight days. {M0.He}{F0.She}’d be the first author to do it! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} embrace the new technology, or stay with good old fashioned dead trees?
Although it was frightening, {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to get the story, and it’s a smash. Next {0.SimFirstName} will write the story of how {M0.he}{F0.she} GOT the story, which should be an even bigger smash!
{0.SimFirstName}’s assistant was so dumb he couldn’t put a sentence together…now that {0.SimFirstName} told the world, the assistant will probably never work again.
The source got in huge legal trouble, so now {0.SimFirstName} can’t find other people willing to talk to {M0.him}{F0.her} on the record! Plus, other writers are publicly shaming {M0.him}{F0.her} for not standing up for journalistic integrity. Was that still a thing?
Something will come along one day. And the one place where a writer shouldn’t make stuff up is on {M0.his}{F0.her} resume.
The backing of such a prestigious paper has put new life in the idealist’s campaign-she just might win after all! Probably not, really, but still! Hooray for principles!
The child is thrilled! She lights up when she hears {0.SimFirstName}’s stories in a way she hasn’t for weeks. Her parents are extremely grateful for {0.SimFirstName}’s kindness.
The host is a jerk, but appearing on TV will really juice sales-and now {0.SimFirstName} is even more well-known.
Hey, we’re all busy. The fan understands, and even a quick encounter with a celebrity is pretty exciting.
The other writer had some great ideas and did an excellent job rewriting. {0.SimFirstName} never could have done it alone.
{M0.His}{F0.Her} job isn’t to comment on history, just to provide the facts. The country is rocked. {0.SimFirstName}’s name will live on forever as a groundbreaking historian.
Readers love the quirky take on their local news. {0.SimFirstName} can even make parking court seem exciting!
