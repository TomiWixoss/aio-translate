One of {0.SimFirstName}'s lieutenants is demanding a higher percentage of the last stickup. Should {0.SimFirstName} reward his loyalty by giving him a bigger cut? Or make him do something to earn it?
Safe Upgrade
The bank must have upgraded their security. It's taking {0.SimFirstName} way too long to crack this safe. The authorities may be on their way, so {M0.he}{F0.she} has two choices: use the drill, or interrogate the bank manager for codes.
Hefty Guard
{0.SimFirstName} signed up to smash {M0.his}{F0.her} way into the target, but wouldn't you know it — their guard is three times {M0.his}{F0.her} size! {0.SimFirstName} can attempt a surprise attack, or try to sneak by.
Bail Out?
A call came in. Joe, from the local crew, is in the slammer. {0.SimFirstName} can post his bail in the name of loyalty, or save those Simoleons because, well, who told him to go and get pinched?
{0.SimFirstName} has hacked into a credit card company's website. It's tempting to replace the home page with a manifesto about the evils of wasteful spending, but a picture of a hamster with laser eyes could be pretty fun.
Scuffed Shoe
Uh oh. An old woman just scuffed {0.SimFirstName}'s new work shoes, and they are the very finest quality faux-gator. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} teach the old lady a lesson, or just let it slide?
Independently wealthy hipsters are opening a vegan juice bar on {0.SimFirstName}'s turf. {M0.He}{F0.She} could try to scare away potential clientele and force the new bar to close. Then again, maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could run a new racket out of the juice bar?
{0.SimFirstName} failed to get the latest shipment. Turns out the police were already waiting at the docks. There must be a snitch in the ring! Will {0.SimFirstName} grill everyone to find out who tipped off the cops, or fire the whole ring and start a new one?
Triangle?
Deep in the internet, The Oracle surfs alone on waves of digital meaning only {M0.he}{F0.she} can understand. Until {M0.he}{F0.she}'s hit up by an untraceable account. Username: Triangle. Message: &quot;I am real.&quot; Does The Oracle connect with Triangle or ignore this possibly dangerous message?
{0.SimFirstName} is leaving the scene of a mysterious arson (loaded with valuables from the burning building) when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a kitten in the upstairs window. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} spend valuable escape time trying to help the animal or just split before the cops show up?
On the train platform, searching for prime pickpocketing targets, {0.SimFirstName} spots a well-known actress. Looks like that's her bodyguard with her. Is it worth a try to pickpocket her? She might be too high-profile a target.
Fractions &amp; Decimals
{0.SimFirstName} writes a script to siphon money from a major IT company, into {M0.his}{F0.her} account, fractions of cents at a time. Seconds post-launch, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a misplaced decimal point. The script is now stealing full Simoleons. Quick! Attempt a hot fix or shut it down!
With the cops hot on {0.SimFirstName}'s tail, the bridge over the river is closed for repairs! {M0.He's}{F0.She's} going to have to pull a 180 and try to swerve between {M0.his}{F0.her} pursuers! Or is it possible to floor it and jump the bridge..?
Abstract Art
A famous abstract expressionist work is headed to the museum via armored car. Although it's similar to a five-year-old's splatter painting, the work is apparently quite valuable. Should {0.SimFirstName} steal it from the car, or wait and snatch it from the museum?
Being the Brains means making the big calls. Which heist should the crew pull next? They could steal a Pterodactyl bone for an evil scientist hoping to clone an evil dino-army, or they could dognap the star of the Chonky Dog Food commercials and hold him for ransom.
Costume Jewelry
After climbing all those gates and rolling under all those lasers, turns out Mrs. Vanderbilt's jewels were cubic zirconia. And a local boss is shaking {0.SimFirstName} down for an unpaid debt. Is there time to take another impromptu job? Or is it best to do nothing without careful plans?
A well-known software company is offering a huge cash reward to anyone who can crack their security. It's a pretty high profile target. Should {0.SimFirstName} go for it?
That took precious time away from {0.SimFirstName}'s work of spam literary genius, and it turned out to be nothing at all. Now {0.SimFirstName} totally lost {M0.his}{F0.her} train of thought. What was the mega ball payout again?
That took some time away from {0.SimFirstName}'s work of spam literary genius, but it turns out there was a virus. {0.SimFirstName} prevented a total computer (and possibly mental) meltdown.

Take Down the Wall
{0.SimFirstName}'s hasty fix causes an error, triggering the program's failsafe. It promptly returns whatever money was set aside and destroys itself. Well. That is a lot of work down the series of tubes.
Bam! {0.SimFirstName} fixes the script before anyone in the IT department can stop playing computer games long enough to notice. Now to sit back and let the program do its thing.
Swipe the Bag
Leave it Alone
The kid crams for hours to prepare for the job, and then sleeps through it! Looks like {0.SimFirstName} is a man down after all.
