Gotta go! Come look for me at {4.String}!
Time for school! I'll see you around.
I need to run or I'll be late for class!
I need to go! I can't be late for school.
I need to run! I'm late for work.
I have to go work. See you around.
I'm off to work. Catch you later.
Great round! {1.String} beat {2.String} {3.Number}-{4.Number}.
Despite being outnumbered, {1.SimFirstName} beat {2.String} {3.Number}-{4.Number}!
Feels like {1.String} ganged up on {2.SimFirstName}, and ended up beating {M2.him}{F2.her} {3.Number}-{4.Number}.
What a game! {1.SimFirstName} ended up beating {2.SimFirstName} {3.Number}-{4.Number}.
{0.SimFirstName} can now take family leave.
{1.SimFirstName} has been brought back to Life! {0.SimFirstName}’s impassioned pleas to the Grim Reaper must have worked.
{1.SimName} is truly gone after {0.SimFirstName}'s ardent appeal fell on Death's deaf ears...
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I'm calling to let you know that {1.SimName} has passed away. I'm sorry for the loss of your dear pet.
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I thought you'd want to know that your enemy, {1.SimName}, passed away.
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I'm calling to let you know that {1.SimName} has passed away. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I'm calling to let you know that {1.SimName} has passed away. I'm sorry for the loss of your dear Horse friend.
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I'm calling to let you know that your close friend, {1.SimName}, has passed away. I'm sorry for your loss.
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I'm calling to let you know that your family member, {1.SimName}, has passed away. I'm sorry for your loss.
Hi, {0.SimFirstName}. I'm calling to let you know that {1.SimName} has passed away. I thought you might want to know.
{0.SimFirstName}'s Spirit is Fading Away.
{0.SimFirstName}'s connection to the physical world is growing weaker with each passing day. Lest {M0.he}{F0.she} be completely forgotten, friends and family should visit {M0.his}{F0.her} resting place and attempt to Strengthen {M0.His}{F0.Her} Connection to the Physical World. They may also evoke {M0.his}{F0.her} spirit and interact with {0.SimPronounObjective} on a more... personal level.
Shut your windows and lock your backdoors, {0.SimFirstName} has released a virus into the wild! This sneaky piece of software has already netted {M0.him}{F0.her} {1.Money}!
By exploiting an unpatched underflowing oversigned buffer search space, {0.SimFirstName} was able to infect thousands of legacy systems. The zombie machines overloaded banking networks worldwide, netting {M0.him}{F0.her} {1.Money}!
That malware blocker plugin is making browsing the web safer for everyone. {0.SimFirstName} has earned {1.Money} for {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts.
{0.SimFirstName}'s spline reticulation plugin is second to none! {M0.He}{F0.She} has earned {1.Money} from sale proceeds.
Better safe than sorry, {0.SimFirstName} shakes the fanatical pursuit, salvaging introversion energies at the expense of social contact. But hey, crazed followers are a sign of {M0.his}{F0.her} career progress (perhaps just not in this case).
Understanding the price of being a public figure, {0.SimFirstName} stops to take time for the fan, enduring frazzled contact and exhausting barrage of compliments with enduring charm. Sometimes a close encounter with crazy helps to appreciate accomplishment.
True artists like {0.SimFirstName} can’t be bought. Sticking to {M0.his}{F0.her} principles {M0.he}{F0.she} tells the brand to shove it! And while losing out on some side hustle, maintaining one’s integrity is priceless.
Sure, it’s nice to have convictions, but they don’t pay the bills, {0.SimFirstName} does. And the bonus cash from endorsements sure helps cover the loss of any inspiration, work performance, or moral high-ground.
With quick, creative thinking {0.SimFirstName} starts to experiment with the strange assortment of merchandise. The final product is a bit messy, but its uniqueness gains {M0.him}{F0.her} some work cred and a bonus payout from one of the showcased brands.
{0.SimFirstName} seamlessly pivots mid-stream, turning the unboxing challenge into a detailed product review which reflects well on {M0.his}{F0.her} professionalism, but at the cost of some potential fun and the chance to get inspired.
Challenging convention and having some creative fun {0.SimFirstName} gambled on an edgy twist to casual attire. The bold move got all the wrong attention by landing it on the “worst dressed” list, a dubious honor that won’t soon be forgotten at work or by future clientele.
Challenging convention and having some creative fun {0.SimFirstName} gambled on an edgy twist to casual attire for {M0.his}{F0.her} client. That risk paid-off and the name {0.SimName} became the buzz of the event.
They say you can’t go wrong with the classics. {0.SimFirstName} found out the hard way  that “They” were wrong, and the safely formal look fell flat at the event when people failed to notice {M0.his}{F0.her} (former) client in the crowd.
The classics are classic for a reason. {0.SimFirstName} opts for a more conventional formality, dressing {M0.his}{F0.her} client in a tasteful but elegant outfit that hits all the right notes at the event. Job well done and well-compensated.
{0.SimFirstName} chose to live-stream a quick outfit overhaul for the fashion or time impaired. The fun but exhausting event was a success in {M0.his}{F0.her} opinion, and a source of new potential inspiration, if not a possible career boost.
Opting to create a guide for quick no-look cosmetic application, {0.SimFirstName} had a blast making-up {M0.his}{F0.her} face on a live stream. And even though a thorough cleansing is in order, the career exposure was worth it.
After the sixth last-minute outfit change request {0.SimFirstName} stands up to the bride and her excessive demands. The heated exchange ended well thanks to some well-spoken words, but not before {0.SimFirstName} lost {M0.his}{F0.her} creativity and some professional credibility.
For just one day, {0.SimFirstName} grins and bears the terror of bride-zilla for the sake of the work and this special life moment. Non-stop exertion leaves {M0.him}{F0.her} physically drained, but fulfilled both occupationally and financially with a unexpected tip from the grateful client.
Try as {M0.he}{F0.she} might, {0.SimFirstName} couldn’t overcome the obvious criticisms of the latest fad. Attempting to fake it was an epic fail that cost fun, inspiration, and positive self of sense.
While not initially a fan, {0.SimFirstName} kept an open-mind and eventually jumped on the trend band-wagon. That positive pivot gained {M0.him}{F0.her} career cred and, more importantly, some surprise creative motivation.

Unable to fake being a fan, {0.SimFirstName} goes full on critic-mode to empirically assess the trend. Regardless of the impact of that approach at work, {M0.he}{F0.she} is content to back up {M0.his}{F0.her} evidence-based beliefs.
Rubbing elbows and making connections for the whole event has left {0.SimFirstName} socially-satisfied with some insights into the latest industry buzz. However that left no time to eat, use the facilities, or watch the show to report back on the fashion.
Ignoring the social scene, {0.SimFirstName} only had eyes for the looks on display and as result left a bit hungry, slightly lonely, but impressed with the latest fads and more than prepared to take {M0.his}{F).her} work to the next level.
{0.SimFirstName} refused to compromise {M0.his}{F0.her} journalistic integrity by selling fiction and submitted the story, on time, as (skillfully) written. Sadly, that did not save {0.SimPronounObjective} from a long conversation with the boss about good news practices.
Missing a deadline: out of the question! Compromising journalistic integrity: not an option. So {0.SimFirstName} submitted the fact-less story as (skillfully) written; which was enough to gain some recognition at work and a warm dose of righteousness.
Unable to find valid sources in time, {0.SimFirstName} used all {M0.his}{F0.her} literary talents to side-step the facts which was a good exercise in creative writing, but at the slight cost of professional credibility and ethical standing.
{0.SimFirstName} went the safe route and drafted a pleasing piece of click-bait that improves her work performance from increased reader traffic, but leaves {0.SimPronounObjective} feeling a bit ashamed that {M0.his}{F0.her} convictions are cheaper than an outlet fire sale. 
Making the most of this rare opportunity, {0.SimFirstName} holds nothing back and spends hours crafting a blistering report that ruffles some feather-boas at work but leaves {M0.him}{F0.her} feeling empowered.
Why fix something that isn’t broken? {0.SimFirstName} decides to keep the current process. Sales targets meet expectations and nothing unexpected occurs.
Under {0.SimFirstName}’s leadership, the new sales process catches on quickly. Employees and shareholders alike are pleased with the unexpected upswing in profits.
Productivity has gone down as people seem confused by the new process, and the focus has shifted to try to sort things out instead of doing actual work! Sometimes the risk of trying something new does not pay off.
{0.SimFirstName} has to deliver the news that the company is closing an entire branch. Many people will lose their jobs because of this, but it means that the company will have enough money to continue operating and to pay bonuses to those who would remain.
{0.SimFirstName} sends an email to all employees explaining that bonuses will not be given this year. Within minutes, people start calling and emailing expressing their anger and sadness. {0.SimFirstName} will be dealing with the fallout from this for quite a while.
{0.SimFirstName} threatens to expose the embezzlement scheme unless {M0.he}{F0.she} is paid a hefty sum. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} just needs to figure out what to do with the extra cash.
After hearing {0.SimFirstName}’s threat, the manager laughs and informs {0.SimPronounObjective} that he records all conversations in his office. If the scheme is exposed, he’ll make sure everyone knows that {0.SimFirstName} wanted to be involved. The only thing {0.SimFirstName} accomplished was making enemies with {M0.his}{F0.her} manager.
{0.SimFirstName} sends an email to the accounting department to have them stop the embezzlement. Perhaps there will be a management spot open for {0.SimFirstName} soon.
{0.SimFirstName} avoids eye contact and continues poking at {M0.his}{F0.her} phone until it’s time to leave the elevator. The CEO probably wouldn’t want to talk to an underling anyway, right?
{0.SimFirstName} strikes up a conversation with the CEO, who ends up being quite friendly. It’s nice to know that the company’s leadership is still in touch with their workers.
{0.SimFirstName} launches into a story about a funny picture {M0.he}{F0.she} recently saw online. The CEO gives {0.SimFirstName} a strange look, then busies {M0.herself}{F0.himself} with {M0.her}{F0.his} phone. The rest of the elevator ride passes in awkward silence.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t have time for this nonsense. Important stapling tasks await! The stapler near the mail room will have to do the job.
{0.SimFirstName} knows exactly who did this and what to do about it: tomorrow morning, the jelly prankster’s desk is going to be plastered in llama pictures!
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t know who did this, so the best thing will be to play a prank on EVERYONE! Unfortunately, when the stinkbomb goes off, {0.SimFirstName} is as grossed-out as everybody else.
{0.SimFirstName} plays it safe and orders the standard supplies. {M0.He}{F0.She} has played {M0.his}{F0.her} part well as a cog in the company’s well-oiled machine.
{0.SimFirstName}’s initiative was noticed by the Assistant Manager who sent an email praising {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts to the entire team.
{0.SimFirstName}’s email inbox is flooded with complaints of broken paperclips, jammed staples, and stinky markers. Looks like sometimes you get what you pay for.
{0.SimFirstName} arranges an appointment for a repairman to fix the copier. Unfortunately, they can’t make it out until tomorrow morning, so people will have to make due without the copier for now.
{0.SimFirstName} glances at the copier’s manual, then opens it up and starts tinkering. After unjamming some paper and refilling the toner, the copier is up and running again. {0.SimFirstName} is an office hero for the day!
{0.SimFirstName} glances at the copier’s manual, then opens it up and starts tinkering. After a couple hours of fruitless toil, {0.SimFirstName}’s hands are covered in ink and the copier is no closer to being fixed.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a strong tone with the client, who promptly apologizes and explains their issue. {0.SimFirstName} is able to route the call to the proper department.
{0.SimFirstName} takes a strong tone with the client, but it makes them even more upset, erupting in a high-volume stream of malicious intent. {0.SimFirstName} timidly hangs up and hopes {M0.his}{F0.her} boss doesn’t find out.
{0.SimFirstName} is able to calm the client down and route their call to the proper department.
Despite {0.SimFirstName}’s best efforts, the client refuses to calm down and before {0.SimFirstName} has a chance to transfer their call, they hang up. Some people just want to be angry.
{0.SimFirstName} decides it’s best to just own up to the mistake. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss isn’t happy, but with some hard work, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} be able to get back in good favor.
{0.SimFirstName} uses some accounting trickery to make it look like a different trader was responsible for the loss. It’s not honest, but you have to look out for #1, right?
{0.SimFirstName} is unable to distance {M0.himself}{F0.herself} completely from the failure, so it looks like {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} just have to take the heat for this one.
{0.SimFirstName} declines the invitation. Maybe next time.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech is the highlight of the conference! Soon, it’s being shared on social networks and is even featured on the evening news. All this positive attention points toward a bull market for {0.SimFirstName}.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech doesn’t hit the mark. It’s not a disaster, but is quickly forgotten. {M0.He}{F0.She} would’ve been better off spending {M0.his}{F0.her} time focusing on work.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to pass on this opportunity. Better safe than sorry.
{0.SimFirstName} moves a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio into the aforementioned stock and by the end of the day, the stock’s value has doubled!
{0.SimFirstName} moves a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio into the aforementioned stock and by the end of the day, the stock’s value is half of what it started at. Guess this wasn’t such a hot tip after all.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t want to upset the boss, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to just let it go. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to remember to respond to both names. Awkward.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss apologizes and offers to buy {M0.him}{F0.her} lunch. The confusion is cleared up and {M0.he}{F0.she} gets some face time with the boss!
{0.SimFirstName} corrects {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, but it comes out a little more harsh than intended. The boss looks annoyed, but at least he’ll get {0.SimFirstName}’s name right now.
{0.SimFirstName} declines the invitation. Maybe next time.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech is the highlight of the conference! Soon, it’s being shared on social networks and is even featured on the evening news. All this positive attention will mean good things for business.
{0.SimFirstName}’s speech doesn’t hit the mark. It’s not a disaster, but is quickly forgotten. {M0.He}{F0.She} would’ve been better off spending {M0.his}{F0.her} time focusing on work.
The assistant grumbles a lot but {0.SimFirstName} is able to get everything necessary done and more thanks to the assistant's help!
The assistant is very grateful and works extra hard over the next few days.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to keep the ideas to {M0.himself}{F0.herself} for now.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss is impressed with the ideas and compliments {M0.his}{F0.her} initiative. “You’re going places!”
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss does not think highly of the ideas. Maybe they weren’t as great as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought they were.
{0.SimFirstName}’s patience pays off when the investments regain most of their value in after-hours trading. {M0.His}{F0.Her} clients will be quite happy.
{0.SimFirstName} watches as the investments continue to lose value throughout the day. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} going to have to deal with some very unhappy clients.
{0.SimFirstName} executes the sell order and within a couple hours, the investments have lost even more of their value. It’s a good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} sold when {M0.he}{F0.she} did.
{0.SimFirstName} executes the sell order and within a couple hours, the investments have gained back most of their value. Looks like {M0.he}{F0.she} should have waited.
