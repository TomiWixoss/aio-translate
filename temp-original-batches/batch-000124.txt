{0.SimFirstName} had a nightmare about being chased by an overly muscular Yamachan. The dream is over, but the images will last a lifetime. 
{0.SimFirstName} woke up in a cold sweat from having a nightmare... about having a nightmare. Oh, come on!
{0.SimFirstName} had a strange dream in which a round yellow Specter with glasses proposed marriage. What a... nightmare? {0.SimFirstName} isn't sure how to feel about it.
