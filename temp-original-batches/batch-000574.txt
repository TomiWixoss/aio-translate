Like what you've made? Save your creations to My Library!\n\nClick the Save Household button to save your Sims to your personal Library.
You can click the My Library button next to each lot type to open up “My Library”, pre-filtered to only show lots of that type.

Save Lot and Save Room are both ways in which you can save your creations for future use.
