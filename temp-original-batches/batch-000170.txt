Pucker up!
Take that, stinky!
Nice catch!
Like a safety net!
Whether for money or a greater purpose, finding a beloved job can be extremely fulfilling!
Strawberry or Grape? Get your groove on!

Improv is an art that {1.SimFirstName} is ready to show off in {F1.her}{M1.his} next show!
The big dip! A cow tail! Little skipper!
Food is fuel and fuel is life!
What hug is {2.SimFirstName} giving? Side hug? Normal hug?!
