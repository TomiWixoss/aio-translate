Afraid of the Dark
In the vast nothingness of the darkness, the night holds mystery, intrigue, and fear.
Need to Escape
Are the walls closing in? It's getting a bit harder to breathe. Was open air always that far away? No time for pleasantries or jokes, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to leave. Now!
{0.SimFirstName} can't fathom being {M0.himself}{F0.herself} while being so stressed out around others.
Too Many Sims
Things are starting to get a little claustrophobic here. {0.SimFirstName} can only focus on mind over matter for so long before {M0.he}{F0.she} will want to leave to somewhere less crowded.
{0.SimFirstName} is too afraid of plants
Fear the Great Cowplant
No matter where {0.SimFirstName} looks, the Cowplant is always there. Its saliva burned into the frightening memory of the encounter. That piece of cake just wasn't worth it.
(From Being Afraid of Cowplants)
Fear Conquered!
Breathing a sigh of relief, {0.SimFirstName} has overcome {M0.his}{F0.her} fear. It feels like nothing can bring {0.SimPronounObjective} down!
One Step at a Time
{0.SimFirstName} has done the first step towards confronting {M0.his}{F0.her} fears, but it will take a little more work to be fully ready to conquer them.
Judging Eyes
It's as if everyone can tell {0.SimFirstName}'s whole life with their gaze. The words might remain unspoken, but {0.SimFirstName} knows everyone is hanging on {M0.his}{F0.her} every word. And not in a good way.
Judging Me Softly
Something feels off. The quick glances away, the silent smirks, the quiet chuckles. No matter where {0.SimFirstName} looks, it feels like everyone else is judging {M0.him}{F0.her} back.
Sorting Out Problems
Sometimes all it takes is a little open communication to discover why a Sim might not appreciate another Sim's company.
Judged
It takes a lot to open up to another Sim and find out what their differences are. That doesn't make it any easier to be rejected.
Growing Stronger Together
It takes time, but discussing issues and problems before they become too big has helped {0.SimFirstName} strengthen their relationship.
Blind Accusations
Trust and communication are key to any relationship but those could easily be shattered by someone throwing around blind accusations.
Something a Cheater Would Say!
It's easy to blow someone off with empty dismissals, but {0.SimFirstName} knows the truth... or maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} just fears the truth and is trying so hard to make it true.
Are They Better?
What do they all have that {0.SimFirstName} doesn't? Is {M0.he}{F0.she} lacking something in their relationship?
Always Time for Them
Gentle signs of affection might not seem much to the untrained eye, but {0.SimFirstName} can't help but focus on all of the affection given out to other Sims and not {M0.him}{F0.her}.
I Knew It!
All of that worrying has come true. Now what?
No More Pesky Burglars!
What was that?! Who's there?! Is the burglar here AGAIN?!
Appreciates Portrait
Some portraits just give that warm and fuzzy feeling.
Day of the Dead Celebrant!
{0.SimFirstName} has got a bone to pick with the Grim Reaper...\n\n...Just kidding; they'll probably be best buds if he shows up! Perhaps they'll enthuse over each other's sugar skull collections?\n\nAs long as {0.SimFirstName} is a celebrant, {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} have a high chance to successfully plead with the Grim Reaper for another Sim's life, and can quickly gain relationship with the Grim Reaper.
(From Giving a Book to the Littlest Neighborhood Library)
You get a book, and you get a book!
{0.SimFirstName} loves that books can now be available to everyone! Maybe {0.SimPronounSubjective} should check for something new or donate an old favorite book!
Prolific Persona
People are starting to take notice. All of that time tirelessly chasing your dream is finally paying off, figuratively and literally. 
Modeling Looks
You do your little turn on the catwalk. Ya. On the Catwalk.
Style Impression
All great works start off as fleeting ideas that inspire refinement. Capture this impression on a Style-board to refine it into fashion fabulousness!
Fashion Fanatic
Being &quot;crazy about clothing&quot; is one thing. Going crazy from clothing is quite another.
Fake News
When did facts become subjective?!
Rejected Write-Up
A recently submitted news-story was declined by the hacks in editorial who wouldn’t know good writing if it jumped off the page, without a care in the world and lived happily ever after. 
Bombed It
Gross-out jokes aren't funny when they bomb.
Spy Swagger
Some agents can't help being great at creating a distraction....
Sponsor Pride
It feels great to give a new young talent a boost!
Sponsor Disappointment
Too bad the artist had plenty of talent but not enough scruples.
Speaker Power
It's a journalist's job to tell the truth, no matter how shocking.
Alien Comedy!
Aliens can enjoy comedy, too. Their laughs may sound like bubbling and their applause like tiny explosions, but a good performance is a good performance.
Inked by Space Squid
There is no bright side of being squirted with space squid ink.
Got Duped
A bird in the hand is definitely better than none in the bush.
So Many Errors
It's a wonder some people make it this far making this many mistakes.
It's nice to be the one in the know.
Impressive Interrogation
Some people just know how to be persuasive. Yeah. Persuasive.

Enlightening School Day
