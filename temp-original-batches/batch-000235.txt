Appreciably Average Digital Camera
Does your baby or dog pose so adorably that you simply must capture every single moment? Is your phone so overloaded with baby and dog pics that you don't have space for apps? Pick up the Appreciably Average Digital Camera and free yourself to take as many pictures of your baby riding your dog like a cowboy as you could possibly want!
Crystal Clear Digital Camera
Made for the true perfectionist, the Crystal Clear Digital Camera is the most accurate photo taking device on the market today. Capturing over a gajillion pixels per photo, viewers will be able to see every tiny detail of every photo taken. Just don't expect to take many photos. That kind of quality comes with a price, and the price is that this camera can only hold 10 pictures at a time. 
Barely Better Digital Camera
Due to its cheap price, this camera is often purchased as a gift for fledgling photographers; however, with picture quality only a smidge better than what a standard smartphone is equipped with, this camera generally ends up as a paperweight. Mostly bought by out of touch family members who are too cheap to go for even middle of the line stuff.

Put your love on a pedestal. Or your dog, or your boss... That’s the nice thing about this pedestal. You decide what goes on it.
Right Side Up Gnome
I think if gnomes were real, and the intention was to create the greatest amount of discomfort for them within their “I hang out in a garden” career path, placing them eternally on their head in service of the tray on their feet definitely falls within the top twenty. But not number one.
Low Stucco Roof Parapet
This parapet doesn't exactly raise the roof of your Mission-style dwelling, but it certainly looks the part.
Shaped Mission Roof Parapet with Quatrefoil
This Mission-style parapet with terracotta edging and quatrefoil embellishment lends gravitas to your roofline. And who wants a roofline without gravitas?

Still Life with Apple and Pitcher and Books and Bottles and Flowers
Painting the most ordinary things can take extraordinary talent. In this masterpiece, the artist has depicted an astonishingly vast array of objects. It is said he began with two apples, but took so long to finish, he devoured one halfway through.
Ode to Jazz Triptych Trio
One thing Princess Cordelia simply couldn’t fit on her submersible was her beloved jazz band. She so missed their music that she painted a series of pictures to commemorate it. Framed in celebratory gold frames, this collection reunites three of her favorite musicians-may they play together in peace on your wall.
Ode to Jazz Wall Painting 2: “Goldentips” in Gold
When Princess Cordelia was forced to flee her kingdom, she had to leave her beloved jazz band behind. Framed in a celebratory gold frame, this wistful silhouette portrays the sax legend Jacob Goldentips still playing in the depths of the sea, which was how the Princess liked to imagine him. [Must be placed on at least a two-story wall.] 
“Blooming Beauty” Wall Painting
Of course, there were no flowers in Princess Cordelia’s subaquatic life, but she had an acute memory of the vases and vases of them that once adorned the Royal House. Oh, the fragrance! Princess Cordelia couldn’t replicate the scent of course, but her painting was quite lifelike.
Land-Coral Garden
Princess Cordelia painted this before gradually fleeing from the giant sloths. Photographs were not commonplace yet, so this painting was all she had to remind her of her old palace’s painting studio. While sitting comfortably on her escape submarine, she changed the name from “Flower Still Life,” to “Land-Coral Garden.”
The Pianist
Not all of Princess Cordelia’s entertainers perished in the Great Sloth Invasion. This pianist knew that if his body was to perish, his name must live on for him. So, he rolled his piano out atop the submersible and played until it went under.
Etude in Blue
Just like music, art can be a celebration-of things we love, of experiences we adore, of people left behind. This abstract painting is a beautiful reverie, a nostalgic tribute to the ne’er-to-be-forgotten performances of years past.
Ode to Jazz 6: “Ghost Quartet”
Some days, the thought of her long-lost jazz musicians was simply too much for Princess Cordelia to bear. She even went so far as to have new instruments made, but with no one to play them, all she could do was paint pictures of them.
Jazz Cats: Whiskers of a Forgotten Past
One thing the Princess was thrilled to leave back in her former kingdom was cats. They shed everywhere and made her sneeze! But nostalgia is a funny thing, and so the princess found herself painting them. As you can tell from this design, her portrayals were a touch romantic.
Saxophone in Silhouette 
Great jazz is hard to come by, especially in the depths of the sea, so Princess Cordelia commissioned a mute reproduction of glorious jazz music. 
Floored by Symmetry Standing Mirror
There it is again. The pure, clean lines of an adulterated rectangle. And shining forth from the heart of its simplicity? You. Stunning!
Captain Chaz MacFreeling Mirror
Princess Cordelia’s second pirate boyfriend was handsome and, relative to other pirates, had good hygiene! Things started off great, but the princess noticed him looking in the mirror all the time; so vain. She promptly sent him on his way, giving him a handful of citrus for any future scurvy outbreaks, and naming all her mirrors after him.
