Maybe {0.SimFirstName}'s conscience got the better of {F0.her}{M0.him}. Maybe {F0.she}{M0.he} just isn't good with making malicious software. Either way, the totally safe and legal company paid a small amount to keep {F0.her}{M0.him} quiet.
The client was overjoyed with the prepared spreadsheet. The formulas were all functional, the filters were all in place, and the cells were almost artistically spaced. {0.SimFirstName} received congratulations for a job well done!
Once the completed spreadsheet was delivered, the client claimed that it was like a mountain was lifted from {F0.her}{M0.his} shoulders. What could {F0.she}{M0.he} possibly be doing that {F0.her}{M0.his} life would be so affected by a spreadsheet? The client gave {0.SimFirstName} a bonus as special thanks for how fast the job was completed.
The client was devastated that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to finish the work on time, but still gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a portion of the pay out of politeness. Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} also needs to take a good look at {F0.herself}{M0.himself}.
The small business owner was amazed, but very confused at the door now open to {F0.him}{M0.her}. No more stacks of boxes full of inventory forms, no more digging for reference numbers. Now if only {F0.he}{M0.she} would stop breaking the formulas and accidentally coloring in cells...
The small business owner was so amazed at the efficiency and organization offered to {F0.him}{M0.her}, it was like a whole new world was now open. Given how fast the job was done, the owner is now convinced that computers are the way of the future. {F0.He}{M0.She} even sent {0.SimFirstName} a care package of their best products, whatever they are.
It seems {0.SimFirstName} also doesn't know how spreadsheets work. Either that, or {F0.she}{M0.he} underestimated the amount of work. Either way, the small business owner was pretty upset. It's a good thing they don't know how to file a formal complaint, so {0.SimFirstName} still received a small amount of pay.
In addition to delivering a compelling indie film poster, {0.SimFirstName} took the time to make up some nonsense about the symbolism of the imagery that {M0.he}{F0.she} included. Predictably, the film's director was enraptured by the care {0.SimFirstName} appeared to have taken to represent the film's vision. Another satisfied client!
{0.SimFirstName}'s indie film poster immediately resonated with movie goers looking to attend the Del Sol Valley Film Fest, as they started clamoring for copies of the poster to be made available for purchase. Recognizing the added revenue that {0.SimFirstName}'s work will bring in, the film's producer authorized a bonus payment to be deposited directly in {0.SimFirstName}'s bank account.
{0.SimFirstName} missed {M0.his}{F0.her} deadline for completing work on the indie film's poster, forcing the director to turn to a marketing agency to have a poster finished in time for the Del Sol Valley Film Fest. An angry voicemail left on {0.SimFirstName}'s phone had the director screaming how {0.SimFirstName} would never find work in this town again, but honestly {M0.she}{F0.he} seems like a bit of a blowhard...
The band is digging {0.SimFirstName}'s work! The concert poster looks, in their words, &quot;sick&quot;. The lead singer let {M0.him}{F0.her} know that there are some extra tickets to the show waiting for him in the will call booth.
The band LOVES {0.SimFirstName}'s work; ticket sales for the concert are already trending upwards and pointing towards a swift sellout. Not only did they include a bonus payment, they've invited {0.SimFirstName} to come chill on the tour bus before the show!
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the concert venue poster tasks in time to receive a full payment. A voice mail left on {M0.his}{F0.her} phone said everything {M0.he}{F0.she} needed to know about how the band felt... {M0.He}{F0.She} heard something along the lines of, &quot;loser square art nerd&quot; before {M0.he}{F0.she} just hung up.
{0.SimFirstName}'s loading screen art is a success! The game's beta testers are transfixed by the gorgeous on-screen art, and no longer seem to mind the loading they're enduring each time they play. Oddly enough, the top request after {0.SimFirstName}'s art was patched in was for the addition of a loading screen progress bar, so players knew how long they had to enjoy the imagery before being returned to the game.
In a sardonic text message, the game's producer told {0.SimFirstName}, &lt;i&gt;&quot;I've got over 99,999 problems, but loading screens aren't one.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; {0.SimFirstName} smiled, having been accepted into the inner circle of the development team as someone trustworthy for them to commiserate with. As a sign of thanks, the producer made a small gesture and named a character in the game after {0.SimFirstName}, as well as awarding {0.SimPronounObjective} with a small bonus payment for {M0.his}{F0.her} outstanding work.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete all of his tasks on time; it looks like the video game will ship with bland loading screens after all. Something as simple as a loading screen can't be enough to affect the game's review scores though... right? Well, whatever -- {0.SimFirstName} will be on to {M0.his}{F0.her} next gig long before then.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forensic sketch work showed a lot of promise. Within an hour of {M0.his}{F0.her} composite sketch being posted to the most wanted database, the police department received multiple tips to follow up on. Fingers crossed that it'll lead to getting more bad guys off the streets.
{0.SimFirstName}'s forensic sketch work led to the direct capture of the head of an organized crime ring within an hour of it being posted to the most wanted list! The police department was so thrilled, that they even let {M0.him}{F0.her} redline a police cruiser with the siren blaring. What a day!
The police department paid {0.SimFirstName} a prorated rate for {M0.his}{F0.her} time, but were disappointed that {M0.he}{F0.she} was unable to complete the job by their deadline.
{0.SimFirstName}'s time spent with the poet went well enough. {M0.He}{F0.She} may not exactly &quot;get&quot; slam poetry, but as long as the client's money is good, {0.SimFirstName} is happy to keep sketching along to {M0.her}{F0.his} verbal fever dreams.
{0.SimFirstName}'s time spent with the poet for an impromptu jam session was absolutely sublime. Words flowed seamlessly from {M0.her}{F0.his} mouth and onto {0.SimFirstName}'s sketch pad. {0.SimFirstName} even earned some bonus cash during their session from passersby who mistook their act as a street performance.
The poet that hired {0.SimFirstName} was upset that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks on time to be able to accompany {M0.her}{F0.him} to the slam poetry session. {M0.She}{F0.He} had an emotional breakdown when realizing {M0.she}{F0.he} still had to pay for the portion of work {0.SimFirstName} did manage to complete, which was followed by a promise to use {M0.her}{F0.his} time on stage to slam {0.SimFirstName} with an excoriating takedown.
The court was pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s skills, and immediately put {0.SimPronounObjective} to work documenting a significant case. It turns out that the job came with the additional perk of having {M0.his}{F0.her} name removed from the jury duty pool; not bad!
The judge was so pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s work, that {M0.she}{F0.he} allowed {0.SimFirstName} to act as an honorary bailiff and announce {M0.her}{F0.his} entrance to courtroom. What a thrill! The bonus pay was certainly a nice reward as well.
{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the gig's goals in time, and is lucky that the courthouse judge didn't declare {M0.him}{F0.her} as being in contempt of court. Thankfully, {M0.he}{F0.she} still received a partial payment; but don't be surprised if {M0.he's}{F0.she's} &quot;randomly&quot; selected for jury duty soon.
The collaboration between the client and {0.SimFirstName} end with a fantastic dive into the future. While the client’s initial idea wasn’t as unique as they hoped, the resulting work of fiction will definitely inspire other writers and scientist to dream of what could be just as other sci-fi stories have done before.
“Bestseller”, that’s all the client kept repeating as {0.SimFirstName} finished their last meeting before the deadline. Nearly every publishing company was chomping at the bits to be the novel’s sole printer.  The client even wrote the entire foreword of the book thanking {0.SimPronounObjective} and noting their contributions to the tale. {0.SimFirstName} wasn’t at all shocked when {F0.she}{M0.he} saw the clients payment for {F0.her}{M0.his} work was much higher than the original agreed amount.
With the client still stuck on a few details of the world and publisher interest waning on the incomplete story, the client scrapped the idea believing they wouldn’t be able to finish the novel. Though {0.SimFirstName} got paid for the work {M0.he}{F0.she} provided, {F0.she}{M0.he} felt like they could have done more to help solidify the idea in the clients head and make something groundbreaking.
