You're right, of &lt;b&gt;course&lt;/b&gt; I should say yes! What was I thinking!? OMG I can't believe this is happening.
You think so? I wasn't sure... but you're right. I guess it just wasn't written in the stars.
Thanks! I was nervous, but now I'm excited!
Yeah, I can do this! Watch me get promoted!
Thank you for the encouragement, I will try to get it!
Maybe you're right... I don't want the extra responsibility!
I would have a lot less free time... I don't want this after all.
If you think so, you are probably right...
Make my own decisions? With no one to guide my actions? Why does this feel weird?
A promotion would mean more responsibility... Is this what I really want? I'll give it more thought.
I was hoping you would suggest something! You're right, though. I should decide for myself.
You are right, I should go for it!
Yes! I'll go for the new job!
Look out new career, here I come!
Really? I guess I should stay in my lane after all...
You're right. Maybe it's not a good idea after all!
You're probably right. I should stay put for now.
I don't know right now! I'll take some time to consider.
It's a big change. I'll have to think on it.
But I called you so I didn't have to decide myself!
I'm glad you brought this up {0.SimFirstName}! I've been thinking the same. Let me chat with {1.SimFirstName} and I'll get back to you!

Just because {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.is}{P0.are} a kid, it doesn't mean {0.SimPronounSubjective} can't be useful!\n\nThe &lt;b&gt;Be Useful&lt;/b&gt; Challenge has been added as a Suggested Challenge in the Aspiration Panel.

Make Up Homework Complete
{0.SimFirstName} has completed {M0.his}{F0.her} Make Up Homework for the day.
Extra Credit Complete
“{M0.Prince}{F0.Princess} of Pranks.” “Destroyer of {1.String}” All titles bestowed upon {0.SimFirstName} for {M0.his}{F0.her} maniacal ingenuity when decorating the gym for the {1.String} Dance. Sure, {M0.he}{F0.she} got in a bit of trouble with the teachers, but that’s part of the fun! All of the school thinks {0.SimFirstName} is hilarious and the dance was way better than it would have been otherwise.
Why decorate for a {1.String} Dance when you could sabotage it instead? That was the thought anyway. {0.SimFirstName} probably should have just decorated like {M0.he}{F0.she} said {M0.he}{F0.she} would. Not only were the pranks disappointing rather than funny, but when the teacher bit into a cookie covered in ketchup—they knew exactly who to blame. {0.SimFirstName} spent the rest of the day sitting in the hall while everyone else had fun.
{0.SimFirstName} might have been tasked with setting up for “a {1.String} Dance,” but instead, {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} be setting up for “THE {1.String} Dance.” With a flurry of banners, streamers, cookies and punch (not literally—that would be messy), {0.SimFirstName} decorated the gym for a {1.String} Dance that would be remembered for years to come!
{0.SimFirstName} went in with hopes ablaze! {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} planned to make this the best {1.String} dance ever! That was before {M0.he}{F0.she} saw what {M0.he}{F0.she} had to work with. Crumpled decorations. No snacks. Polka music! To make matters worse, nobody else had volunteered. When the dance started, everyone blamed {0.SimFirstName} for the lame time they had.
It took most of the day for {0.SimFirstName} to work up the nerve and ask that special sim to the party, but it was totally worth it! {0.SimFirstName} stole shy glances at {M0.his}{F0.her} date as they congregated along the wall and awkwardly chatted about their classes, school sports, and the weather (which oddly had been much more active as of late)! By the time the party was over, {0.SimFirstName}’s heart was a flutter!
It took courage! That’s what {0.SimFirstName} would have to keep telling {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. The moment {M0.he}{F0.she} asked that special sim to the {1.String} Party, was the exact same moment {M0.he}{F0.she} got shot down. The response “No” had been instantaneous and followed by the cruel snickers of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates. {0.SimFirstName} spent the party hiding in the bathroom. Embarrassed. With a llama cookie—which was delicious but didn’t make up for what had just happened.
{0.SimFirstName} wasn’t interested in inviting anyone in particular. Instead, {M0.he}{F0.she} decided to focus simply on being the life of the party! While {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates indulged in awkward banter and ‘wallflowering,’ {0.SimFirstName} lead the charge for fun! Who delivered flowers to everyone in attendance? Who started a Chubby Llama competition? And who talked the teacher into playing the cool music? {0.SimFirstName}, of course! It was an epic school party that begged only one question: Whatever did {0.SimFirstName} do with the chaperones?
Was it the fact that {0.SimFirstName} went alone that made it the worst {1.String} School Party of all time? OR was it the fact that {M0.he}{F0.she} spilled punch all over {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, slipped on the floor, and then accidentally knocked down a teacher! Because, although {0.SimFirstName} felt pretty awkward standing along the wall alone, the whole knocking down a teacher thing was really bad.
“Sensitive, Sweet, Charming, Thought-provoking”—these are a few of the descriptors kids are whispering about {0.SimFirstName} in the halls. Some say, the school bully renounced his previous ‘taxation” on school lunches, the popular girls are allowing anyone to sit with them (even if they aren’t wearing pink), and nobody has been stuffed in a locker today—and all because of {0.SimFirstName}’s cards! Is this what being a teen legend feels like?
