Make a Prank Call
You little stinker! Do you think I was born yesterday? I'm not nearly dumb enough to fall for your stupid prank.
Very funny, I've heard that prank before. Try being a little more clever next time!
You can't fool me, this is {0.SimName} I'm talking to! Next time try pranking someone a little more gullible.
What are you talking about? I didn't place an ad for a three-legged llama for sale! No, you can't come pick it up!
Wow, I won the grand prize? I didn't even enter the contest. I can't wait for my award to show up!
A shipment of 100 llamas is coming to my house? I didn't order that. There must be some kind of mistake!
What's that? Speak up, I can't hear you... Actually I can hear you, and I know you're playing a prank on me!
Oh very funny {0.SimFirstName}, try your prank calls somewhere else next time!
A what?! At my house right now? I've, uh, I've gotta go {0.SimFirstName}!
{0.SimFirstName} is too ashamed of the last prank call to try another right now.
Hmm, I didn't order a pizza, but I'll gladly take one.  It sounds scrumptious!  You're quite the salesperson!
Play Hooky
You don't sound sick to me, {0.SimLastName}!  See you soon!
Oh, absolutely, {0.SimFirstName}.  You rest up and feel better.
{0.SimFirstName} should wait a while before trying to play hooky again.
