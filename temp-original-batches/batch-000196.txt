&lt;i&gt;Coco loco, aplacando esta sed que me abraza, coco loco, que un buen rato contigo se pasa.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nCoquito is a traditional Christmas Holiday drink from Puerto Rico and some say it can be called the Puerto Rican Eggnog. Coquito is served usually after dinner and in a small glass and its taste is sweet and strong. If you are brave enough feel free to add Eggs - personally it is ok without.\n\nMany families have their own variations that are passed down through generations, but we hope your Sims enjoy this simified virgin rendition of this drink as prepared by our wonderful Sim Mixologists.

Coquito
Considered often the National Drink of Brazil. This is a very refreshing and simple to make option to enjoy any festivity. According to historians, it was invented by landowning farmers in the region of Piracicaba, interior of the State of São Paulo, during the 19th century as a local drink for 'high standard' events and parties, a reflection of the strong sugarcane culture in the region.\n\nWe hope your Sims enjoy this simified virgin rendition of this drink as prepared by our wonderful Sim Mixologists.
