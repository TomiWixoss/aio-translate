{0.SimFirstName} is Imbalanced, which will probably manifest in some unfortunate way.
Balance &amp; Imbalance expresses how a Sim's Mood affects them over time, beyond moment-to-moment.\n\nSims that generally spend more time in negative Moods will move toward Imbalance, while positive Moods move back toward Balance. Some major life events can also change balance instantly!\n\nImbalance comes with various effects, such as impacted Needs or very high vulnerability to Ailments.
Balance &amp; Imbalance
Beyond the emotional ups and downs each day brings, {0.SimFirstName} is Balanced.
Balanced
{0.SimFirstName} has stayed in a good Mood lately and is currently feeling Balanced.

Find a Tenant Household to live in this Unit and become a Property Owner! Set the Lease Length and Rent Per Day through the Tenant Agreement before moving in your tenants. Rent for all owned units will be collected by the end of the week along with any bills due. Beware of changing any details on the Tenant Agreement after Tenants have already moved in, as that would negatively impact the unit's rating!
