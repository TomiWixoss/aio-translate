Keep this good mood going!
Who needs a good laugh? {2.SimFirstName} does, and who better to make them laugh than {1.SimFirstName}?!
{2.SimFirstName} is having a rough day. Let's shine some light on {2.SimFirstName}'s day!
Time to spread some of those good vibes to the world!
Kindness goes a long way.
{2.SimFirstName} seems like a friendly Sim and it wouldn't hurt to get to know {M2.him}{F2.her}! Would it?
{1.SimFirstName} thinks it's about time to make it official. {2.SimFirstName} is terrible and sometimes becoming enemies is inevitable.
Sims sometimes just grow apart naturally and sometimes Sims need an extra push.
{1.SimFirstName} is socially drained and would like to have nice, peaceful alone time.
Every Sim around is starting to look suspicious to {1.SimFirstName}. {1.SimFirstName} wants to... no, needs to run a background check on someone.
{1.SimFirstName} wants a break from children. They're just so sticky for no reason!
{1.SimFirstName} is getting butterflies just thinking about {2.SimFirstName}! Maybe it's time to ask {2.SimFirstName} on a date!
{1.SimFirstName} is wondering how {2.SimFirstName}'s day is going.
Take up the bow!
{1.SimFirstName} is riddled with guilt over how {M1.he}{F1.she} treated {2.SimFirstName} and would like to apologize.
{1.SimFirstName} just got a new specimen and can't wait to unravel its secrets!
The truth has to be in one of these books! And {1.SimFirstName} must find it!
{1.SimFirstName} just got back from a shopping spree and can't wait to look at all the new stuff {M1.he}{F1.she} bought!
{1.SimFirstName} is so excited to admire the new art exhibit at the Museum!
{1.SimFirstName} loves art and it has been quite some time since {M1.he}{F1.she} had a chance to really stop and stare at some beautiful art pieces.
{1.SimFirstName} feels that this Style Board is good...but it's missing something, and {M1.he}{F1.she} knows exactly what it needs.
Is there enough time for {1.SimFirstName} to fulfill {M1.his}{F1.her} dreams? Maybe sharing these fears with someone close will help.
Swimming does not come naturally to {1.SimFirstName}, but it is never too late to learn! Time for the tried and true doggie paddle!
{1.SimFirstName} has had enough of these Ghosts ruining {M1.his}{F1.her} life. {1.SimFirstName} has mustered enough courage to go face to face with a Ghost, winner takes all. If {M1.he}{F1.she} can win against a Ghost in a fight, everyone will see that {M1.he}{F1.she} is no longer afraid.
Fire left unchecked will engulf everything in its path! {1.SimFirstName} has seen it happen once before. Will {M1.he}{F1.she} let it happen again? Or will {M1.he}{F1.she} extinguish it in time?!
The truth can set you free! Maybe {1.SimFirstName} does good work. But there are ways to prove it. Asking for a performance review or showing off {M1.his}{F1.her} work will prove that {M1.he}{F1.she} is capable.
Death doesn't have to be scary, right? How do other Sims deal with death? Maybe the elderly or those ghosts that keep popping up have some advice. Or maybe, the Grim Reaper would be in the mood for a flower.
Why did {1.SimFirstName} take this job in the first place? Well, obviously because {M1.he}{F1.she} loves {M1.his}{F1.her} job! Maybe it is time to rally and show everyone that the passion for this work is not gone!
{1.SimFirstName} is sick and tired of letting the possibility of monsters keep {1.SimPronounObjective} from going out at night. Nothing can stop {1.SimPronounObjective} from living {M1.his}{F1.her} best night life.
{1.SimFirstName} might be uncomfortable around crowded places but that doesn't need to stop {M1.him}{F1.her} from being funny! {1.SimFirstName} feels ready to get out there and overcome {M1.his}{F1.her} insecurities around large groups of Sims.
Remember: All {1.SimFirstName} has to do is milk the Cowplant and not go near its mouth. Or accidentally fall in it. {1.SimFirstName} can do it!
Okay, today is the day! It is time to stare back into those judgy eyes and figure out exactly why they feel the need to judge {1.SimFirstName}!
{1.SimFirstName} feels like {M1.he}{F1.she} is ready to sit down and talk with {M1.his}{F1.her} partner. It won't be an easy conversation, but being vulnerable and talking about insecurities never is. {M1.He}{F1.She} knows that it is time to be brave.
