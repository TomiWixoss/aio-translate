Once your Sim has a Career, you can find everything you need to know in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career panel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\n\nThe top half lists your title, salary, schedule, and available vacation days. The bottom half lists your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Promotion Requirements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Having a &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is one of the best ways to make &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Simoleons&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! The starting salary can be a bit on the low side, but when you climb the career ladder you can make big bucks.\n\nAdvancing in Careers will also unlock unique Objects and Clothes, and allows your Sim to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;retire&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and get a pension upon becoming an Elder.
Your Sim can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;join a Career&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by using the Business app on their phone, or by opening the Career panel selecting Join a Career.\n\nCareer &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;success&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; depends on different Skills. It’s a good idea to base your choice on your Sim’s current skills, or any Traits that help them build Skills. But with hard work, any Sim can succeed in any Career!
Let’s talk about &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;promotions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Promotions mean new &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;rewards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and better &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;salaries&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. To get promoted, you need to fill the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Performance&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; bar and fulfill any &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Requirements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (usually reaching specific Skill levels).\n\nThe best ways to increase your Performance are completing your &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Daily Tasks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and going to work with a positive &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Emotion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. \n\nWhile they’re at work, you can also select the Away Action icon on Sim’s thumbnail and order them to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Work Hard&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for an extra boost!
Bugs
We apologize if you find a bug. We hope that you can forgive us for not finding it ourselves.
What is a bug? Everything from a software crash, a freeze, or a memory leak; to grammatical errors, missing user interface data, and clipping.
Software has bugs. The etymology of the term &quot;bug&quot; is greatly debated, although it is an accepted fact that it predates software.
Moodlets
Each Moodlet has an emotion strength associated with it.  Your Sim determines their current Emotion based on the Moodlets they have.
Interactions in the game can push different Moodlets upon your Sims. Brush your teeth, and you might be feeling Minty Fresh. Neglect your hygiene, and you might be Grungy.
Some Moodlets will be multi-colored, these are Happy Emotion Moodlets, or Bonus Moodlets. If you are currently in any Emotion other than Happy, Bonus Moodlets will enhance your current Emotion.\n\nNote: Hover over your Moodlets to see their effect, how you got them, and what Emotion they are boosting.
Your Sims are emotional beings. And their Moodlets drive their emotions.
Bonfire
The Bonfire allows Sims to hang out with friends or cozy up next to that special someone. It'll burn bright and colorfully!
Find all the secrets that the bonfire holds! Sims with high mischief can use the voodoo doll to mess with other Sims. Having a ghost possess it can also be a sight to behold.
Try burning different things in the bonfire! You can live drag objects in the Sim's inventory to experiment. Sims with traits may even react to what's being burnt!
Aging &amp; Birthdays
Any cake can be a Birthday Cake.\n\nBake a cake, click on it and choose Add Birthday Candles.
You can also use the Birthday Cake to age up your friends and neighbors, just in case you want them to always be the same age as you.
When your Sim is ready for the big moment, have them Blow Out the candles on their Birthday Cake and watch them transition to their next set of life experiences!
Negative Emotions
Negative emotions should be seen as a challenge and a goal to solve. Experiment as your Sims cruise the emotional landscape!
New interactions become available and others disappear based on your Sims' emotions.
Negative Emotions like Sadness and Anger will change your Sim's behavior and outlook on life. At least temporarily.
When your Sim is in a negative Emotion, you can help them recover\n\nThe Emotional Whim can always help you find a way to deal with your emotions.
Baby Care
Be sure to bottle or breast feed babies to provide nourishment.
Babies will need to be cleaned often as well as they aren't yet potty trained.
And don't forget, give babies plenty of love!
Aspirations
Achievements
Achievements are goals for you to work towards across multiple households and save files (Achievements are saved per EA Account).\n\nNote: In some cases, you will be unable to gain an Achievement by playing only one household.
You can also use the Achievements tracker to help guide you in your exploration of The Sims 4.  Maybe you'll find out something you didn't know existed in the game by reading the Achievement goal.
To view all of your Achievements, enter Live Mode, open the Options Menu, and choose Achievements from the menu.
Scenarios
You can start a new Scenario from the Main Menu. When choosing a Scenario you will be able to start a scenario with new, existing, and pre-made households. Some Scenarios will have options to start with new or existing households, while some will require either a new or premade household.\n\nPre-made household scenarios will be indicated in red text on the Scenarios menu.
Scenarios put your household in an interesting situation with some initial setup and long-term goals for Live Mode. Completing these goals will progress you through the Scenario to an outcome and reward your Sims!\n\nMore types of Scenarios will be added over time, so check back periodically for new, updated, or limited-time Scenarios.
The Bassinet is an essential object expecting parents should purchase for their newborn.\n\nIf you don't purchase a bassinet, don't worry, your baby will still arrive in their very own (or maybe two if you have twins!).
So, you want to know if you are having a baby... your Sim can take a Pregnancy test by interacting on the toilet to really be sure, or, you can just wait to see what happens.
When your Sim's pregnancy is at an end, the baby will be born. Be ready at any moment! Your Sim will receive a Birth Certificate that you can place on the wall!
Pregnant Sims will have adjusted physical needs and Emotions. It may get rocky at times, but it's worth the effort!
Neighborhood Stories Settings
To configure custom settings for all Sim households in the tab, select the top right icon. Remember that My Households and Other Households have separate settings. Sim households that move from one tab to the other will only be affected by Neighborhood Stories settings for their current tab location. You may wish to configure custom Neighborhood Stories settings for Sim households you do not want to undergo independent life changes.\n\nTo configure custom settings for individual Sim households, select the left icon at the bottom of each household.
To see Notifications of what life changes have taken place recently, enter Live Mode and go to a Mailbox, then select Check Recent Neighborhood Stories. Visit a Neighbor Sim to check in on them as their lives change and develop over time!
Select either My Households to configure households you've played, or Other Households to configure households you haven't played. By default, Neighborhood Stories is only enabled for Other Households, with all types of life changes allowed. 
Once you select the Neighborhood Stories configuration button, you can toggle on or off each type life change. Click the check button to confirm changes.
Neighborhood Stories can be quickly configured for all Households and/or individually per Household. Select Manage Worlds in the Options Menu, then select Manage Households.
Neighborhood Stories Life Changes
Neighborhood Stories allows Neighbor Sims and Households that you aren't actively playing to experience life changes. There are various types of life changes that can occur, as long as the given life change is enabled in Neighborhood Stories settings under Manage Households.
Neighbor Sims can also join and leave careers, with some Elder Sims choosing to retire. 
Neighbor Sims can expand their families by becoming pregnant or adopting young Sims. If your active Household is friendly with the Neighbor Sims, they may get a call to announce the new additions to the household.
Neighbor Sims may even die before their time. While unfortunate, accidents happen! You may want to visit the family of a deceased Sim to offer them condolences.
Neighbor Sims may move in or out of Lots in the world. The lot must be set as Residential with enough beds for Sims to sleep in. Build your own houses or download houses from the Gallery for Neighbor Sims to occupy.
Social
In a pinch, call a Sim or chat via the computer to fill your Sim's Social Need slightly.
Call a Sim over to your Sim's home or travel to a community lot (like the gym!) to meet Sims in person.
Sims require Sim-to-Sim interaction, else they go a little crazy.
Sims will take care of their Social Need on their own if you let them and they are able to do so!
Hygiene
Washing your hands via the sink is only a temporary solution, but every bit helps!
Hygienic Sims will be happier and more successful socially.
Sims require the occasional splash of water on their skin. Try taking a Bath or Shower. 
Sims will take care of their Hygiene Need if you let them and they are able to do so!
Hunger
Sims who take the time to cook a proper meal will not only enjoy it more, but they'll learn in the process!
If your Sim is low on time, Have a Quick Meal from the Fridge or Microwave. 
Sims will take care of their Hunger Need if you let them and they are able to do so!
Sims need to eat food a few times every day or they might die of Hunger! Eat snacks or prepare meals for increased nourishment.
Fun
Better fun items cost more Simoleons, but are well worth the investment!
Sims can have fun playing games, reading, watching TV, and more!
