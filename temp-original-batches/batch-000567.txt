Do boba pearls remind anyone else of tears slowly falling down into the sadness of your soul?
Why does cafeteria food have to be so soggy?
Lunch is the best time of day, you can see all your friends and enjoy some tasty dishes!
Is it wrong to like the cafeteria food? It's the highlight of my day.
I wish I brought my own lunch. This is just gross.
You say socially awkward, I say independently advanced!
The social FOMO is such a downer, but I do not wish to be perceived. The spotlight is haunting.
A pillow smack to my soul! It will take days to crawl out of this hole of sadness.
Even a little bit of social interaction is a step in the right direction.
I fumble around to find the right words and by the time I do it's too late. Social skills are not my strong suit.
What happened in the photo booth, stays in the photo booth. xoxo
Oh no. I'm pretty sure there was a tongue in my ear for that shot.
Totally cheeky moment to keep in a very hidden scrapbook! What a rush! 
That's not a filter. Our faces really are that flushed and red. I wonder what we could've gotten up to in there.
Dark. Intimate. Limited locations for hands to wander. The photo booth may be my new happy place.
Strike a pose! How fierce! These photos are model quality.
Where is this dismal abyss? Is there a good angle of my face? Do I always look like a sea squash or is it the lighting?
I'd rather eat lemons than be trapped in a photo with some of the kids I go to school with. Major ick.
I could not get the timing right in that photo booth and ruined every photo! How lame is that?!
That pillow fight was euphoric. I feel like I'm glowing.
How many can I take?! I want a million!
Smiles for days! Every angle is a happy one!
Say cheese! Nothing cuter than a smiley photo!
A night away from family for besties and blankets? Sign me up!
You won't find a pea under this mattress but that doesn't make it any more comfortable. I miss my own bed.
Jammies, snacks, gossip...Sleepovers are the vital bonding moments of adolescence. Plus they're fun!
Pom poms or not, I'm the football team's biggest cheerleader! Score! Score! Score!
I could not tell you a single detail about what happened at that football game. I'm pretty sure I blocked it out.
Check this off my list. I've officially gone to a football game AND I enjoyed it!? How crazy.
They really do keep all the good stuff behind R ratings! Gotta say though, the popcorn was the real MVP.
I'm not entirely sure I should've seen that movie. It's rated like that for a reason. I can't unsee that.
Someone kept kicking my insanely sticky seat the entire time. This is why I stream movies at home.
My seat was sticky and someone kept kicking my seat. Not exactly a thrill of a lifetime.
Who knew that taking a pillow to the face could be so thrilling!
That movie had so many forbidden words and now my brain knows them all... What if one slips out!?
Did I love the movie or did I love sneaking in? Maybe both! My whole body is tingly with excitement.
My ears won't stop ringing and I'm drenched in sweat that may or may not be mine. Ugh. Were concerts always like this?
Waking up with no voice tomorrow will be hard to hide but so worth it. Ten out of ten, would scream every song again.
I don't think I'll have a voice tomorrow from all the screaming! It was worth sneaking out for the lifelong memories.
I'm still reeling from the concert rush! That exhilarating euphoria will live in my bones for days!
If given the option to sleep or go stand around outside, I think I'd choose sleep.
It's nice to just be out and about! 
Sneaking out means seeing friends. Seeing friends means bonding time. Bonding makes you happy. It's not rocket science.
I liked being a warm blanket burrito more than hanging out late at night.
Sneaking out was a huge risk and just to see some friends? I'm all for fun, but being caught is not on my to do list!
I went a little too hard. It was supposed to be just a friendly pillow fight.
