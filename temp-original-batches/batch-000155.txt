Logging into The Sims 4 Gallery allows you to view creations made by other players, post comments, get updates from creators you are following, and select items from the Gallery to later download into your The Sims 4 game.\n\nOther players, including your friends, can follow you in the Gallery and view your Gallery profile. You can also see who is following you. If you do not want anyone to follow you or view your Gallery profile, simply change your EA Account privacy settings so that “No One” can see your profile. With this setting, other players will still be able to view and comment on content you have uploaded to the Gallery.\n\nBy using, you certify compliance with &lt;span class=&quot;tosLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a href='event:clickEvent'&gt;EA's User Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
