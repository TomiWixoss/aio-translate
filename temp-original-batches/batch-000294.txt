Enable Acne
Opt out of discovering new Personality traits
If disabled, Sims will no longer have Self Discovery moments that offer new or changed Personality Traits.
Self Discovery
Disabling this will stop Layoffs from happening for your sims.
If disabled, Sims will not experience layoffs in their careers.\n\nSims in a current layoff period will not be laid off and the period will officially resolve at the end of the next work day.
Career Layoffs
If disabled, Sims will no longer experience the positives of Good Luck and the negatives of Bad Luck. Luck will no longer appear in the Simology Panel.
Enabling this option means the result of a Sim's actions may be influenced by their Luck.
Enable Luck:
If checked, Fairy Sims outside of the Active Household will not appear autonomously in Fairy Form in Worlds other than Innisgreen. Certain player-directed actions will still cause Fairy Sims to reveal their Fairy Form.\n\nThis change will not be applied to Fairy Sims that are currently spawned until after the next load.
Enabling this option means you will not see Fairy Sims in their Fairy Form outside of Innisgreen, except through player action.
Limit Fairies to Innisgreen
If disabled, Sims will not experience any effects related to Balance or Imbalance. This may mean a Sim experiences fewer Ailments but will not eliminate them overall. Balance &amp; Imbalance UI will not appear in the Simology Panel.
Enabling this option means that Moods will influence Sims' state of Balance over time, leading to effects that impact Needs and Ailments.
Enable Balance &amp; Imbalance:
If disabled, Ailments will no longer spread contagiously. Once disabled, Sims who already have Ailments will need to wait it out or seek a cure, but no more Sims will contract Ailments through spontaneous spread. Being near or interacting with Sims who have an Ailment will no longer have any risk of contagious spread.\n\nWhether or not this is disabled, Fairy Sims in your Household can still give Ailments to other Sims if they have unlocked the Cure or Apply Ailments Fairy Ability. Naturopath Sims who choose to Work From Home will still be able to receive clients with Ailments who need treatment.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Sims who become Very Imbalanced will still contract an Ailment. Uncheck both &lt;i&gt;Enable Balance &amp; Imbalance&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Enable Ailment Spread&lt;/i&gt; to disable all natural sources of Ailments.
Enabling this means Sims can develop Ailments from everyday exposure, especially being around other Sims who already have an Ailment.
