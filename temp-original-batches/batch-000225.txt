Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. This time, {0.SimFirstName} definitely lost. Perhaps {M0.he}{F0.she} should just go to work and do a good job instead of trying to cheat the system.

{1.SimFirstName} did it! That supercomputer wasn't so super, after all! {1.SimFirstName} even managed to take {0.Money} from the supercomputer project's funding.

Well isn't {0.SimFirstName} just a little over-achiever? {M0.He}{F0.She} already has a perfect grade. It can't get any better!
It worked! A little hacking and {0.SimFirstName} is already a smarter person. And {M0.he}{F0.she} has the grades to prove it!
Hopefully {0.SimFirstName} was trying to hack {M0.his}{F0.her} grade lower because that's what {M0.he}{F0.she} ended up with. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should hone those hacking skills a bit more.
