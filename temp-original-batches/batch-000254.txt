Hello? Is this working? These modern technologies... Always more trouble than help. Anyway, I run a small business. We're going over 40 years strong, but lately our customers have been asking if their data is secure. What does that even mean? It's trapped in an electric box of madness that I don't know how to use half the time. That's secure right? Anyway, someone mentioned encryption. Do you know encryption? I sure don't.
