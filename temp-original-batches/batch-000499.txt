Those are not raisins. They're now the eyes of a man who survived two world wars. {0.SimFirstName} painted {M0.his}{F0.her} way back to greatness.
Oops. Now it just looks like a biscuit with bifocals. Might be time for {0.SimFirstName} to start over from a blank canvas.

Hm. It started out promising, but more and more {0.SimFirstName} is starting to feel like the local community just isn't ready for &quot;Pig Nose Galaxy.&quot; {M0.He}{F0.She} scraps the work and goes back to square one.
{0.SimFirstName} believes this could be {M0.his}{F0.her} greatest work to date! Soon the local community will praise &quot;Pig Nose Galaxy&quot; for its boldness.

Maybe they're right. Maybe that red square with a blue dot is a bold statement about humanity's resilience in the post-modern world. {0.SimFirstName} decides to say so. The crowd nods quietly.
Mow over Sticks
Pick Up Sticks

Use the Backhoe
Go Back to Nursery
Level by Hand
Yeah! {0.SimFirstName} feels like a true backhoe master…until the backhoe flips with {M0.him}{F0.her} in it. A note for future reference: to be a backhoe driver you need two things—a working backhoe and a healthy driver!
{0.SimFirstName} isn’t paid the big bucks for acting like a fool. {M0.He}{F0.She} parks {M0.his}{F0.her} backhoe safely and uses a shovel instead. It will take longer and mess up the timeline a bit, but {M0.he}{F0.she} knows that it’s not worth taking the risk.
Well, youthful inexperience only gets you so far, especially when a stick jams your mower. {0.SimFirstName} can’t finish the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} circuit, and has to spend {M0.his}{F0.her} shift clearing out {M0.his}{F0.her} blades instead.
{0.SimFirstName} squeezes through the nursery gate just as the owner is locking up. Grabbing the last few petunias, {M0.he}{F0.she} slaps down a few Simoleons and heads back to finish the job. The result: a perfect petunia path, perfectly on time. {0.SimFirstName}’s boss and the client are perfectly pleased.
With a little creative rearranging, {0.SimFirstName} makes the petunia path even more elegant than before.  {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss is a bit nervous, of course, but when {0.SimFirstName} assures the client that minimal design is in, everyone praises {M0.his}{F0.her} forward (and frugal) thinking.
That’s right! {0.SimFirstName} is a backhoe master! Guiding the machine skillfully, {M0.he}{F0.she}  suddenly realizes how much {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} learned. All this practice is paying off!
Eager to Show off {M0.his}{F0.her} creativity, {0.SimFirstName} rearranges the flower garden, mixing colors and sizes to conceal what's missing. The client isn't exactly appreciative. In fact, he's furious. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss apologizes for the mistake and makes {0.SimPronounObjective} redo the entire job.
Better safe than sorry! {0.SimFirstName} collects all the sticks as fast as {M0.he}{F0.she} can and does a thorough job mowing the lawn. The owners give {M0.him}{F0.her} a grateful wave, and {M0.he}{F0.she} still has a working mower to finish the next job!
{0.SimFirstName} mows right over the sticks and finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} route in record time. Impressed, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss promises to give {0.SimPronounObjective} more work, maybe even focusing on some tidier houses!
Behind Schedule
{0.SimFirstName} is already running behind schedule when {M0.he}{F0.she} arrives at a particularly cluttered yard. {M0.He}{F0.She} clears all the kids’ toys, but notices there are still tons of sticks on the grass from the shade trees above. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} pick them up, or just mow over them?
Uneven Terrain
{0.SimFirstName} is clearing a lot for the brand-new SuperPlex when {M0.he}{F0.she} comes across some uneven terrain. Just at the edge, where the JumboSign should go, the hill rises sharply on one side and drops on the other. {M0.He}{F0.She} knows it would be safest to level this part by hand, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} on a tight schedule.
Landscape Project
{0.SimFirstName} is almost done with a stunning landscaping project when {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he}{F0.she} is two petunias short. The project is already a week behind schedule. {M0.He}{F0.She} can try running back to the nursery to get more, or work with what {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got.
At High School
Sure enough, {0.SimFirstName} gets an A for {M0.his}{F0.her} beginner’s origami. (And the little paper frog even hops when you press it!) The good grade brings up {M0.his}{F0.her} entire average by a point or two!
Although {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not as wired and amped-up as some of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, {0.SimFirstName} feels good about {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to give {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a rest. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes the test feeling refreshed, and can easily recall all of the required information.
OK, so {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t get 100%...{M0.he}{F0.she} got 98%, which is pretty darn good. Not re-taking the test means {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} happier and less stressed out.
{0.SimFirstName}’s brain goes into hyperwarp as {M0.he}{F0.she} begins devouring information. Luckily, the sugar and caffeine rush lasts all the way through the test before a mighty crash hits. Nailed it.
The teacher seems as bored as {0.SimFirstName} is, and doesn’t even notice the spitballs, despite {0.SimFirstName} landing a papery clump right in a classmate’s ponytail.
The teacher’s errand didn’t take as long as he thought, so he comes back and sees {0.SimFirstName} not doing the reading. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a lecture on the importance of sitting quietly and following orders.
Right after the lights come up, the teacher hands around a quiz—{0.SimFirstName} has no idea what the plot of the movie was! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets an F when {M0.he}{F0.she} should have been able to score some easy points.
Since {M0.he}{F0.she} has time to focus, {0.SimFirstName} finishes the reading early. Then {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to do some of {M0.his}{F0.her} homework too!
{0.SimFirstName} breezes through the easy test, and the extra study time on the harder test really pays off! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets and A- and a B+! Not bad!
{0.SimFirstName} is no better off than {M0.he}{F0.she} was yesterday, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} no worse off, either. Although the teacher is disappointed that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t show more initiative.
Turns out that the class can be pretty interesting! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} will make a habit of this “learning” stuff. 
The good grade does bring up {0.SimFirstName}’s average, but the assignment is so mind-numbing that {M0.he}{F0.she} wishes {M0.he}{F0.she}’d taken something a little more stimulating.
{0.SimFirstName} unleashes a tirade of poetic insults and put-downs, then drops an imaginary mic. The bullies quickly lose interest in harassing someone who’s willing to stand up for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.
This seems less like a study group and more like an opportunity for the smartest kids to show off how much they already know. {0.SimFirstName} is so far behind that listening to them doesn’t really help at all.
{0.SimFirstName} refuses, blaming the teacher. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} heard that you can’t get anything past that guy! The friend understands and doesn’t blame {M0.him}{F0.her} at all.
The rival suspiciously takes the notebook, but then blames {0.SimFirstName} for stealing it in the first place. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} has to explain that {M0.he}{F0.she} was just trying to do a good deed. Yeesh!
Once they see how hard {0.SimFirstName}'s working, the other kids start slacking off! No good deed goes unpunished.
Well, it feels pretty good to have done the right thing. That giant 0% on a major assignment doesn’t feel great, but it’s better than getting expelled, right?
Adding something so difficult impresses the teacher. {0.SimFirstName} is clearly ready to get serious about {M0.his}{F0.her} education. Even though {M0.he}{F0.she} only manages an average grade, {M0.he}{F0.she} still learns a lot of new information that can be applied in class.
Wrong answer. Oh well—{0.SimFirstName} knew the risks when gerunds got involved. 
The movie is pretty good. This hardly feels like school at all! And {0.SimFirstName} always wanted to learn how astronauts go to the bathroom in zero gravity.
{0.SimFirstName} really has been working hard in school! A few minutes into giving {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a quick rest...{M0.he}{F0.she} falls asleep! The slap of papers on {M0.his}{F0.her} desk jolts {0.SimPronounObjective} awake a short time later. Test time already?! Oh no!
{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher lets {0.SimPronounObjective} do some extra problems. The teacher would rather see {0.SimPronounObjective} understand the concept a little late than not at all. {M0.He}{F0.She} gratefully completes the work and earns a few extra points on {M0.his}{F0.her} grade.
The guidance counselor is so concerned with {0.SimFirstName}’s descriptions of academia-induced hyper-stress (an entirely made up condition) that she insists {0.SimFirstName} be excused from the next few tests. Nice! 
If {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} only worked harder, if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} only tried again, {M0.he}{F0.she} could have achieved test-taking perfection. Everyone knows that perfection is a totally achievable goal and to settle for anything less is shameful.
{0.SimFirstName} really did know most of the answers for the easy test already. The extra review didn’t help much. That time could have been spent studying for the other test, which was brutal. {M0.He}{F0.She} winds up with an A+ and a C-. Not the best.
Surprisingly, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates do not like getting hit in the face with spit and paper. The teacher sighs and sends {0.SimFirstName} to the principal’s office. 
The owner is grateful to get it back, and invites {0.SimFirstName} to {M0.his}{F0.her} house to study sometime. {0.SimFirstName} didn’t want to get ahead by being dishonest.
The lost money gets reported and the principal orders a full locker sweep! {0.SimFirstName} gets caught with the money and sent to detention.
Even though this wasn’t {0.SimFirstName}'s idea, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are angry about having {0.SimPronounObjective} in charge. They refuse to participate or behave, and eventually {0.SimFirstName} has to call the principal for help!
The straight A kids would rather just do something quickly and correctly than wait around for someone else to figure it out. They don’t mind doing {0.SimFirstName}'s work, and {M0.he}{F0.she} looks good at the end of the project.
After thirty minutes of laughing and having fun with friends, {0.SimFirstName} feels totally refreshed and ready to get back to work. It’s almost like {M0.his}{F0.her} brain functions better when {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} well-rounded!
The teacher’s drone is like a sweet, sweet lullaby gently rocking {0.SimFirstName} into a nap. But when {M0.he}{F0.she} starts drooling the teacher snaps {M0.him}{F0.her} awake with a detention.
The extra study time was vital for that difficult test, and brushing up on the material for the easy test was worthwhile too! {0.SimFirstName} earns a B+ and an A! Sweet!
{0.SimFirstName} earns a whopping 25% on the test! {M0.He}{F0.She} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} should have gone with the repeating A, B, C, D pattern instead. Well, live and learn!
The project benefits from having everyone’s input. It’s a standout success and the teacher gives {0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} teammates equally high grades.
The principal acknowledges the courage it took to bring the money to him. He then launches into a 20-minute speech about honesty and integrity that {0.SimFirstName} tunes out of halfway through. But the principal does insist that {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher give {M0.him}{F0.her} extra credit for good citizenship!
If bullies responded to well-crafted arguments, they wouldn’t be bullies. They understand that they’re being insulted, but they don’t quite understand how, and that just makes them madder.
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend has never been known for subtlety. The teacher sees the crib sheet {0.SimFirstName} made sitting out on the desk. Both {M0.he}{F0.she} and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend fail the test, and get a stern talking to.
