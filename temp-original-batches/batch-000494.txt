Share Findings about Forgotten Grotto
A forgotten grotto? It sounds like another wild goose chase. Stick to reality...
Incredible! It reminds me of the magic in Sylvan Glade. Hidden places hold such enchanting secrets!
Sounds far-fetched to me. Not every cave hides wonders. You're chasing shadows.
Fascinating! I've always believed there's more to explore beyond the surface. Maybe we can uncover more secrets together!
Ask about the Whispers
{0.SimFirstName} already talked with this Sim about what you found in the Forgotten Grotto
I thought I was imagining it! It's comforting to know I'm not alone in sensing the mystery around us.
I don't hear anything, and frankly, I think you're imagining things. Let's stick to reality, shall we?
Ask about PlantSims
Take this Magic Bean! Growing the tree opens paths to the Forbidden Fruit. Imagine the possibilities of becoming a PlantSim!
The Forbidden Fruit could lead to unexpected transformations. You probably couldn't handle such a change.\n\nTake this Magic Bean, I don't want it.
Magic Beans and Portal Trees? Sounds like a fairy tale. The Forbidden Fruit might be more trouble than its worth.\n\nSince you seem so interested, take this Magic Bean I found.
You already asked this Sim about PlantSims.
PlantSims? Here's a Magic Bean for you. It can help transform your garden into a Mystical Magic Bean Portal Tree.\n\nAnd you can even plant the Forbidden Fruit for more wonders!

As {0.SimFirstName} approaches, {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.overhears}{P0.overhear} the Envoy muttering something about the fireplace.\n\nStartled, the envoy quickly turns and says, &quot;What? Oh, I wasn't saying anything. Just enjoying the atmosphere!&quot;
Surprise!
Ask about Library
The envoy looks surprised to see {0.SimFirstName} at the library... \n\nThey quickly say, &quot;Ah! I didn't think you would be here so quickly... The Darong's Family treasure is hidden here somewhere in these old archives. Why not help me uncover its location? I believe you will be the next guardian of their legacy!&quot;\n\nWith that, the Envoy slips away once more, their departure raising suspicion.

Discuss Romance and Music
The Envoy, clearly eager to leave, says, &quot;Oh, look, I really have to go. Don't bother following me, but listen...I think you should take some time to learn to play romantic music. If you discover anything...interesting...just only tell me! K, thnx, bye.&quot;
According to this show...it's pretty typical to have found love at a nightclub; it seems like the ideal place that connects with music and love.
