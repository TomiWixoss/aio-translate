Talking to this client might get on {0.SimFirstName}'s nerves, but a job is a job. Completing all of {F0.her}{M0.his} tasks on time in the face of overwhelming pretentiousness is the mark of a true professional!
The movers and shakers of the modern world might speak in a strange way, but they know what they're doing. Very appreciative of {0.SimFirstName}'s quick turnaround, the company rewarded {F0.her}{M0.him} with a very nice bonus, as well as a promise that {F0.she}{M0.he} has helped change the world.
&quot;We're never going to experience the future with this kind of work...&quot;\n\nIt was harsh to hear, but it's true. Not finishing the job is bad enough, but it's devastating to such visionaries. {0.SimFirstName} managed to work out a deal of a prorated amount of pay by using these words.
Sometimes the best things in life come from accidents. This turned out to be one of them. The client was very pleased with the completion of the job, and wrote a very nice recommendation for {0.SimFirstName}. It can't really be used because it was obviously written with voice to text, but it's the thought that counts.
The seemingly accidental job posting turned out to be for a highly anticipated product. The speedy completion of the landing pages helped the organization of the marketing plan immensely, and {0.SimFirstName} was given a nice bonus for {F0.her}{M0.his} efforts.
Given that the job posting seemed unintentional, {0.SimFirstName} was surprised that the client seemed very upset when it wasn't finished. {F0.She}{M0.He} was even more surprised when {F0.she}{M0.he} received a payment anyway. It's a small amount, but it's better than nothing!
Adding another e-commerce website into the abyss is a risky business strategy. Still, the company launched {0.SimFirstName}'s work and released it to the world. Only time will tell if it is successful.
After {0.SimFirstName}'s website was approved, the e-commerce startup immediately got to work. Turns out, they're actually very competent and the website caught on. For {F0.her}{M0.his} speedy completion of the job, the company gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a small portion of their initial sales as a bonus!
{0.SimFirstName} couldn't deliver the promised website by the deadline, so the project was canceled. Trying to maintain the image of a real business, the e-commerce startup paid a prorated amount for the time spent on the project.
&quot;Any day now!&quot; The hopeful cryptominer was pleased with the delivery of the viruses, and immediately set to work. {0.SimFirstName} received {F0.her}{M0.his} payment and tried {F0.her}{M0.his} best to ignore the increasingly desperate updates the client keeps sending.
So it turns out SimCoin is real, and actively traded. It took an amazingly short amount of time for the client to report finding their first SimCoin. Thanking {0.SimFirstName} for the speed of {F0.her}{M0.his} delivery, the anonymous individual transferred over the payment with a nice bonus on top.
The shady individual didn't enjoy the news that {0.SimFirstName} couldn't provide the promised viruses. Still, the mysterious persona claimed that they were going to be rich soon anyway, so they still paid a modest amount for the time spent.
{0.SimFirstName} is doing {F0.her}{M0.his} part in making the world a safer place. At least, that's what the antivirus company keeps saying in their correspondence. That's nice and all, but the pay is even better! 
The antivirus company was thrilled with the speed and diligence of {0.SimFirstName}'s work. They wanted to send {F0.her}{M0.him} a medal, but {F0.she}{M0.he} insisted that the payment would be enough. Eventually, they settled on a decently sized bonus. Everyone is happy!
The antivirus company wasn't pleased that {0.SimFirstName} couldn't deliver anything to help with their research, but still gave a portion of the pay as they don't blame anyone for &quot;not wanting to fall to the dark&quot; as they said.
{0.SimFirstName} completed the job and delivered those viruses. {F0.She}{M0.He} doesn't need to know what that company wants to use them for. Things will be fine! Perfectly fine, as long as the money transaction goes through. You can't wire dirty money, right?
The speed that {0.SimFirstName} finished those viruses actually intimidated even the less than angelic company. Clearly, they're dealing with a malware professional, and need to be careful. Still, a job well done needs to be rewarded, and the company added a decent bonus on top of the payment.
