(From Fear of Dead-End Job)
{0.SimFirstName} never knows what is lurking in the dark. Darkness is nothing but a veil to hide the most gruesome and terrifying creatures of the night. {M0.He}{F0.She} feels like they could pop out at any moment! And lately, this man named Vladislaus keeps calling!
(From Fear of the Dark)
(From Fear of Crowded Places)
Too many Sims in one place! Is this max capacity? Is this now a fire hazard?! WHAT IF THE GROUND OPENS UP?! Maybe it is time for {0.SimFirstName} to sneak out.
(From Fear of Cowplant)
{0.SimFirstName} survived the horrific feeling of being inside the mouth of a Cowplant! {M0.He}{F0.She} never wants to feel the terror of being in one again! What if the Cowplant bites next time?!
(From Confronting Fears)
Fear Progress
(From Fear of Being Judged)
It might just be coincidence, but {0.SimFirstName} can't shake the feeling that others are just constantly judging {0.SimPronounObjective}. Is it {M0.his}{F0.her} hair? Personality? Friends? Whatever it is, {0.SimFirstName} is afraid that this won't be the end of it.
It feels like it has been forever since {0.SimFirstName} has been romantic with {M0.his}{F0.her} partner. It could be paranoia, it could be anxiety, or a gut feeling, but {0.SimFirstName} can't help but wonder what {M0.his}{F0.her} partner is up to or who they are seeing behind {M0.his}{F0.her} back!
(From Being Accused of Cheating)
(From Fear of Being Cheated On)
{0.SimFirstName} put {M0.himself}{F0.herself} forward and opened a line of communication, but the problems aren't over. Maybe another day of communicating {M0.his}{F0.her} worries will finally help overcome {M0.his}{F0.her} fears.
Ever since {0.SimFirstName} realized {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} precious things could be sucked into the burglar's sack any evening, {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.has}{P0.have} been fretting about how {0.SimPronounSubjective} can better protect {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} stuff for next time.
