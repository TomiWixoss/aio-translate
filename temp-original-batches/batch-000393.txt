Nothing beats a good break up article. Using pictures and information provided by Fab Magazine, {0.SimFirstName} was able to craft a heartbreaking article featuring two of Plumbob Picture’s most prominent stars and how their love was torn apart by studio schedules, nightly parties, and a secret lover. Fab Magazine gushed about it so much, they used it as the cover article for their latest issue and gave {0.SimFirstName} a little extra when finalizing the contract.
{0.SimFirstName} missed Fab Magazine’s deadline, causing their article to be cut from the tabloid. While {F0.she}{M0.he} was compensated for what writing they already finishing, this mistake might affect {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation as a writer.
{0.SimName} did a lot of back and forth with the client, arguing whether 4 should be higher or lower on the list.  In the end, {F0.she}{M0.he} got {F0.her}{M0.his} way, though.
{0.SimName} had clearly been keeping a list ahead of time. Split across 10 separate webpages, the top-10 list monetized greatly!
Only being able to come up with a list of 8, it wasn't much of a top-10. {0.SimFirstName} got paid appropriately for that work, though.
 'Bumbling Baby Bubalus' checks the right boxes. This may not be the instant classic we were hoping for, but it will be some child's treasured book.
 'Vulpes Counts the Critters of the Mauven Forest' is on track to be the number #1 children's book this holiday season. It is also reported that toddlers who read this book now need both hands to show how high they can count.
 'Alternate Uses for a Pet Yorier' is not what we expect out of a children's book. The detailed chapter on how they can be used in life or death survival situations alone is enough to get this pulled from store shelves. Please do not return to this office.
The story rewrites {0.SimName} did really helped with the story flow, really helping with the bedtime part of the stories. Just reading them made the client sleepy. In a good way.
The stories {0.SimName} wrote are perfect for children. They'll learn important lessons, but also the parents will thank {F0.her}{M0.him} for the time they gain back each night once the kids are asleep. 
The client tells {0.SimName} teddy bears aren't meant to have conquering armies and epic love stories. It's a great concept, but it's both a little too mature and exciting for children. {F0.she}{M0.he} got paid a little less, since the work won't be used. 
{0.SimFirstName}'s character concepts made it to the film's producers just in time. As an industry outsider, they mentioned that {M0.his}{F0.her} creations aren't quite film ready, but they're still quite thankful to have received {M0.his}{F0.her} help.
The film's producers are overjoyed with {0.SimFirstName}'s character concept creations! Each of {M0.his}{F0.her} designs are film ready, and the costume and makeup artists are already hard at work translating {M0.his}{F0.her} concepts into outfits for the film's stars. As a thanks for keeping the film production schedule on track, they've promised to feature {0.SimFirstName}'s name in the title sequence, and have added extra money to his payment.
Plumbob Pictures executives are outraged that they still had to pay {0.SimFirstName} a portion of the gig's payout, despite the fact that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't complete all goals. In a retaliatory move, they leaked {M0.his}{F0.her} identity to the striking workers, naming {0.SimPronounObjective} as the scab that agreed to replace them.
The game's producers are pleased with the characters that {0.SimFirstName} created, and confirmed that his designs would appear in the final game. Not only was the pay good, but {0.SimFirstName} is now excitedly looking forward to seeing {M0.his}{F0.her} characters come to life within a digital world!
It's hard to stand out when you're a nameless cog in a large machine, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to do so with {M0.his}{F0.her} stellar character creations. As a sign of thanks, the development team gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a bonus payment, and even image mapped {M0.his}{F0.her} face onto one of the enemies in the game, so that {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll be digitally immortalized!
{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the requested work, and as a result did not receive a complete payment. The game's producers mentioned that they'd wished {0.SimFirstName} had simply put in extra time to get the work done, and to not expect further contracts in the future if this is the way {M0.he}{F0.she} professionally conducts {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.
The indie dev {0.SimFirstName} submitted {M0.his}{F0.her} character designs to had an air of pretension that rubbed {0.SimFirstName} the wrong way. They may have been looking for passionately crafted art, but {0.SimFirstName} was just looking to get paid... and in that sense, it all worked out just fine.
{0.SimFirstName} found {M0.himself}{F0.herself} on the exact same wavelength as the indie dev, and the two of them were obviously jiving when it came to each other's passion for art. The dev was over the moon for {0.SimFirstName}'s characters! Despite having to work within a very strict budget, they still managed to slip {M0.him}{F0.her} a small bonus payment to show their appreciation.
It turns out that {0.SimFirstName}'s passion for character designs didn't match that of the indie dev who contracted {M0.him}{F0.her}, as {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't complete all of the expected goals on time. Still, {M0.he}{F0.she} got paid a bit for the portion that {M0.he}{F0.she} did accomplish, and handed the entirety of it off to the dev for them to do whatever they want with it.
Writing the stories for the long-passed and filling out family tree reports for interested parties, {0.SimFirstName} helped connect people to their pasts.
Making sense of complicated letters, stories, and lineage maps, {0.SimFirstName} helped many people connect with their long-lost (or otherwise unknown) families! Winterfest is going to be a much bigger event this year, thanks to {F0.her}{M0.his} work.
{0.SimFirstName}'s contract was cut short for making all the wrong kinds of connections. They're not suggestions, they're historical! Still, they agreed to pay the minimum for the work done.
The client is pleased with {0.SimName}'s writing. Though, he seems to think anyone would have done well, given the source material. 
{0.SimName} really captured what makes the client important and great. He can't wait for the world to find out about how awesome he is at that thing that he was so important. He'll definitely keep {0.SimName} in mind for a followup book about the next fantastic thing he does.
After reading the biography, the client wonders if {0.SimName} was really listening to how amazing he was. He gave feedback suggesting it was too &quot;real.&quot; They agree to end the contract with a prorated fee.
Whew, paintings can start to get really risqué when the nectar starts to flow. Ultimately though, everyone had fun and went home happy - and most importantly, {0.SimFirstName} got paid.
The nectar and painting class went off without a hitch. So many of the happy participants signed up for another class, that not only did the program's owners pay {0.SimFirstName} a bonus, they actually painted and hung a portrait of {M0.him}{F0.her} in the lobby of the building!
The nectar and painting class's proprietors are displeased that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to finish all of the goals, but begrudgingly paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a portion of the agreed upon payment for the part {M0.he}{F0.she} did complete.
{0.SimFirstName} wasn't sure how {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} deal with an unruly classroom of students, but to {M0.his}{F0.her} surprise, everyone was attentive, well behaved, and ready to learn. {M0.He}{F0.She} collected {M0.his}{F0.her} paycheck, and went about {M0.his}{F0.her} day... The more you know!
{0.SimFirstName} will never admit it, but {M0.he}{F0.she} greatly enjoyed booting an unruly student out of class. Everyone else was remarkably well behaved though; one student even gave {M0.him}{F0.her} an apple to show their gratitude! Word of {0.SimFirstName}'s great job reached the dean, who paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a little bonus for a job well done.
Having not completed all of {M0.his}{F0.her} expected goals, the art students went untaught for the day, and are angrily lodging complaints to the dean's office. Per the substitute professor contract, {0.SimFirstName} still managed to walk away with a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay.
{0.SimFirstName} took pride in teaching the camp's self-proclaimed &quot;artists of tomorrow&quot;. While {M0.he}{F0.she} isn't 100% certain they'll all live up to that lofty aspiration, {M0.he}{F0.she} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} did her part to usher them down the right path.
{0.SimFirstName}'s heart swelled with joy at the opportunity to pass down {M0.his}{F0.her} artistic skills to the next generation of talented painters. The children's eyes were wide with wonder as {M0.he}{F0.she} gave {M0.his}{F0.her} demonstration, and they leapt to action in an attempt to recreate {M0.his}{F0.her} painting. The counselors expressed their gratitude by letting {0.SimFirstName} sign the wall of one of the camp's cabins, as well as slipping {0.SimPronounObjective} a bonus payment.
The camp's counselors are distressed that {0.SimFirstName} did not complete all of the assigned goals. Who will properly teach the youth now?! It got even worse for them when they read the fine print of the contract, and discovered they still owned {0.SimFirstName} partial pay for the portion of the work {M0.he}{F0.she} completed.
