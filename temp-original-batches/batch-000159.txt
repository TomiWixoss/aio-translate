From those of us at Maxis, a heartfelt thank you to all of the Sims players who participated in the creation of this Stuff Pack. This cooperative partnership was inspired by your feedback, and The Sims™ 4 Laundry Day Stuff came to fruition because of players like you. \n\nWe hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed sharing the development process with you.
