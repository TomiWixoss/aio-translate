I did it, I got the job! Now my dreams are closer than ever!
Remember that job we talked about? I got it!
Guess who just got a promotion? No, not you, it was me! Success, here I come!
I can't believe it, they gave me the promotion!
Did you hear? I got the promotion we talked about! 
I ended it with {2.SimFirstName}. You and I should go out sometime to help me forget about {M2.him}{F2.her}.
{2.SimFirstName} is great! I’m glad I got to know them.
Are you sure we are talking about the same person? {2.SimFirstName} wasn’t so great…
Thanks for setting us up, {2.SimFirstName} and I are going out!
Why didn’t you tell me {M2.he}{F2.she} was already in a relationship?
That didn’t go so well. I don’t think we’ll be going out again.
I don’t see the point in talking to {2.SimFirstName} any more. But I guess I’ll just put on a face…
I agree, {2.SimFirstName} is not so great, {M2.he}{F2.she} is not cool.
{2.SimFirstName} is great! 
I spoke with {2.SimFirstName} and find {M2.him}{F2.her} quite pleasing!
I don't know. {2.SimFirstName} didn’t seem that interesting.
I’m trying to understand why you wanted me to talk to {2.SimFirstName}…
{0.SimFirstName}! I gave {2.SimFirstName} a fair shot, but the end result was what I expected. Our values don't align and I'm not sure there's a way to work around that.
I'm glad you picked up, {0.SimFirstName}. I wanted to let you know that I spoke with {2.SimFirstName} and it was immediately obvious that this friendship wasn't going to work due to our differences.
Hello {0.SimFirstName}! I reached out to {2.SimFirstName}, but after getting to know {F2.her}{M2.him} a little better I realized that our personalities don't vibe well.
{0.SimFirstName}, {2.SimName} and I really hit it off... we're officially dating now!
{2.SimName} and I are... officially together! Thank you, {0.SimFirstName}!
Were you aware that {2.SimName} already has a partner? That information would have been helpful.
{0.SimFirstName}, it appears that {2.SimName} already has someone special. That would have been good to know...
{2.SimName} and I are two completely different people... that relationship was doomed to being with!
I thought you knew what I valued in a relationship {0.SimFirstName}! {2.SimName} and I will never see eye to eye.
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, why did you hook me up with {2.SimName}? We're not even close to being compatible.
I just ended things with {2.SimFirstName}. I'm sad, but it will pass, won't it?
I finally broke up with {2.SimFirstName}. I wonder if that will open my horizons?
Remember when you told me I could do better? Well, I took your advice and broke up with {2.SimFirstName}!

{1.SimFirstName} and I have a little bun in the oven. I can't describe to you how excited I am to be having a baby!
How are you doing {0.SimFirstName}? {1.SimFirstName} said you would be thrilled to know we're expecting a baby soon!
Morning Sickness is nothing to take lightly! You might have guessed but, {1.SimFirstName} and I will be having a baby soon.
Thank you for our earlier conversation {0.SimFirstName}. {1.SimFirstName} and I are both on board and expect to deliver a baby soon!

Baby News! {1.SimFirstName} and I are pregnant, and I wanted to make sure you heard it from me first.
Try for that baby!
We've been thinking about Trying for a Baby lately. Do you think we should do it? We want to, but we're not sure. It's a huge responsibility! What do you think?
You should decide for yourself.
Yes! It's a lot of work, but you've got it.
Yes! I mean, I wouldn't. But you should!
No! That sounds exhausting!
No, I don't think it's a good idea.
A child? They are annoying, don't do it!
Say yes!
Don't do it!
So I found a ring in {2.SimFirstName}'s bag. I think {M2.he}{F2.she} is going to propose to me. I don't know what to do! What should I say!? Yes!? No!? Gahh!?
You should really decide for yourself.
Oh geez... um, oh gosh... uh... Yes! Do it
If you need to ask me, your heart is not in it!
After thinking about it more thoroughly I realized that a career change is not in the cards for me. I do however appreciate your concern, so thank you {0.SimFirstName}!
Hey there {0.SimFirstName}. As inspiring as our recent discussion was, I don't think right now is a good time for me to switch careers.
{0.SimFirstName}! I wanted to let you know that I've been looking for a new career, but haven't found anything of interest. It looks like I'll be sticking with this one for now.
{0.SimFirstName}! I'm happy you answered and I have exciting news to share. I switched careers!
Hey {0.SimFirstName}, I was thinking about our conversation the other day and decided to go for it. I changed my career!
I've been pondering your advice {0.SimFirstName}, and you're right! I should be doing what makes me happy so I switched careers.
No, I don't think you are up for it.
Yes, you should totally go for it!
Do it! Aim for the stars!
That would mean more work, don't do it!
That should be up to you.
More money and prestige, but more work and responsibility. Should I try to get a promotion?
I heard my boss saying I would be a good candidate for a promotion. Do you think I can do it?
There is a rumor at my workplace that someone will get a promotion! Should I try to impress my boss to get it?
A new job? Fantastic, go for it!
I don't think you should do it.
Yeah, I think you should try a new career!
You should follow your heart.
A job? That's too much work... Don't do it!
{0.SimFirstName}! I need to challenge myself! A new job might be the solution, what do you think?
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I feel like trying something new and exciting... something like changing careers! What do you think?
Hey {0.SimFirstName}! I have been thinking of getting a new job, what do you think?
