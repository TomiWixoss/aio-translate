{0.SimFirstName} sets a new personal record for cola consumption and finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} far too busy bouncing off the walls to prepare for the test properly.
The class can finish the assignment later—now it’s time for a game of Truth Or Dodgeball, where people either answer embarrassing questions or get hit by dodgeballs. That’s what the teacher gets for storing dodgeballs in the classroom!
“Why, what a nice presentation. How straightforward and expected,” says the teacher. {0.SimFirstName} earns a straightforward and expected grade.
Even after all that work, {0.SimFirstName} still doesn’t quite get it. But {M0.he}{F0.she} learned that sometimes in life there’s credit for just showing up and trying—the teacher bumped {M0.his}{F0.her} grade up by a few points anyway.
Although the teacher loves it, {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates grumble that {M0.he}{F0.she} made them all look bad. They’re angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for throwing off the curve.
Although {0.SimFirstName} tells the counselor the truth—{M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t feel encouraged to try harder—the counselor doesn’t believe it’s that simple. Now {0.SimFirstName} has to come back three times per week to talk about {M0.his}{F0.her} “feelings.”
School Flower Fundraiser
In honor of {1.String}, {0.SimFirstName}’s school always allows students to buy flowers to be delivered to each other during class. With some money to spend, {0.SimFirstName} decided to take advantage of the fundraiser and celebrate the holiday!
Hunger Strikes
{0.SimFirstName} is really trying to pay attention in class, but {M0.his}{F0.her} stomach is growling LOUDLY. These darn growth spurts...now {0.SimFirstName} is worried {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates can hear. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to sneak a snack from {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch, or wait for the bell?
Friend's Birthday?
Everyone seems to be talking about a birthday party that {0.SimFirstName} wasn’t invited to. {M0.He}{F0.She} kind of thought the host was {M0.his}{F0.her} friend, so it doesn’t make any sense. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} ask {M0.his}{F0.her} friend, or let it go?
Class Interview
{0.SimFirstName} is the class All Star today, and {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to be interviewed by {M0.his}{F0.her} entire class! {M0.He}{F0.She}’s feeling nervous and kind of excited, until someone asks, “How come you always get A’s?” Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try for something witty, or just be real, like the teacher said?
Love Letter
{0.SimFirstName} is grabbing {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch from {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices something red inside. It’s a note, shaped like a heart, with the words “U R CUTE!” written on it and nothing else. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks it might be the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy}, who always seems to stare. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} ask {M0.her}{F0.him}, or wait and see?
Tissue Paper Flowers
In celebration of {1.String}, {0.SimFirstName}’s class made tissue paper flowers! The teacher asked all of the students to give their flowers away to someone special. Now, {0.SimFirstName} just needed to think of the right person…
Go to High School
Go to Grade School
Yuck! Disgusting. The mystery glop is chunkier than it first looked and REEKS of re-processed onion.  {0.SimFirstName} drops {M0.his}{F0.her} rag in the trash and scrubs {M0.his}{F0.her} hands raw, but the stink sticks for what seems like hours.
Well, that backfired. Instead of graciously stepping aside, the customer is furious and takes even more time complaining about the “lack of respect” and “pitiful service” and “problems with today’s youth.” Her yammering brings out {0.SimFirstName}’s new manager, who ends up comping her order.
Five second rule, right? {0.SimFirstName} slaps on some cheese and extra sauce and moves on to the next order. Unfortunately, this order was for one of those “check the burger and notice hair and used chewing gum stuck to it” customers. The customer yells at the manager, who in turn yells at {0.SimFirstName}.
No one can actually take forever, even if it feels like it sometimes. {0.SimFirstName}’s smile is frozen to {M0.his}{F0.her} face, but eventually {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the woman’s order and turns to the next person in line. So much for fast food. But fortunately no one seems too surprised.
Five second rule, right? {0.SimFirstName} slaps on some cheese and extra sauce and moves on to the next order. When no complaints come back, {M0.he}{F0.she} sighs in relief, trying not to notice the grime on the floor.
The manager isn’t thrilled about the extra time or wasted meat, but {0.SimFirstName} sure feels better doing the right thing. Not that {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} ever eat here, knowing what {M0.he}{F0.she} knows, but it gives {M0.him}{F0.her} hope someone might do the same for {M0.him}{F0.her} someday.
Luckily, it’s just about time for {0.SimFirstName}’s break. Unluckily, a shriek interrupts {M0.his}{F0.her}  departure. A cheerleader just sat down in the mess, and she is not happy about it at all. {0.SimFirstName}’s manager calls {0.SimPronounObjective} out to wipe down all the chairs while the entire restaurant watches.
Luckily, it’s just about time for {0.SimFirstName}’s break. By the time {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} back, the mystery glop is gone, though where it went {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t know.
Nice work! When {0.SimFirstName} points out the line behind her, the woman agrees to let someone else go first. Even better, {0.SimFirstName}’s new manager is watching and praises {M0.his}{F0.her} “proactive thinking.” Score!
Wait for Her Order
Ask to Step Aside
When {0.SimFirstName} takes over the register, the line is already out the door. But it seems the customer at the counter hasn’t noticed:  the woman squints at the menu, grimaces, thinks. The line’s getting longer—and grumpier. Should {0.SimFirstName} ask her to step aside to decide on her order, or wait for her to make up her mind?
{0.SimFirstName} is on a roll! This joint is so clean, {M0.he}{F0.she} can see {M0.his}{F0.her} face gleaming back from the tabletops! But then {M0.he}{F0.she} notices some kind of pinkish glop jiggling from the seat of a chair. {M0.He}{F0.She} could just wipe it—and throw out {M0.his}{F0.her} rag—but then again {M0.his}{F0.her} job title does say “table...”
{0.SimFirstName} is barely keeping up with the lunch rush when a burger slips off {M0.his}{F0.her} spatula onto the floor. Instinctively {M0.he}{F0.she} pounces, snatching up the steaming patty before anyone sees. Really, it was only there for 4 seconds. Will the customer even know?

What a howl! There’s nothing animal lovers love more than a few good animal jokes! The crowd goes wild and donates generously. Now these animals should have a better quality of life than {0.SimFirstName} does!
Unfortunately nobody shows up, for {0.SimFirstName} or the other “comic”. {0.SimFirstName} is sure {M0.he}{F0.she} was the funniest {M0.guy}{F0.gal} in the house, and now, no one can argue.
Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} should have trusted {M0.his}{F0.her} instincts. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets crickets for {M0.his}{F0.her} disgusting humor. Why’d they laugh for the other comic? It seems gross only stays fresh so long...
{0.SimFirstName} creates a scene fending off the old piano player. The crowd is not happy. They come to listen to old standards and forget about life for a while, not watch ugly confrontations between selfish pianists! The bar owner intercedes and gives the set to the other player.
The indignant mother leaves in a huff, sticking {0.SimFirstName} with the bill for the repair. So much for “extra cash on the side.”
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend loves the dig! He is so thrilled to be part of the routine that he buys {0.SimFirstName} a drink to celebrate.
Later, {0.SimFirstName} sees one of the other composers giving an interview where he claims full credit for the final score. Is anyone even going to believe that {0.SimFirstName} helped once the interview is published?
The director refuses. He loves the script how it is, and he makes sure his colleagues know where the credit belongs: with the other comedians.
Not only is {0.SimFirstName} twice as frustrated, the cellist in the practice room next door is frustrated too. It would be easier to get it right without all that pounding on the wall.
At first {0.SimFirstName} thinks the cellist hasn’t heard {M0.him}{F0.her}. But when {M0.he}{F0.she} tries again, it’s clear {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} getting brushed off. {M0.He}{F0.She} wonders if {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} wind up being blamed for the discordant tones once they perform.
It might not be the most glamorous gig, but {0.SimFirstName} feels that {M0.he}{F0.she} made the right choice. Sims enjoy the music and a decent amount of money is raised for a good cause.
The child squeals with delight and throws {0.SimFirstName} every ball he can find. It goes well until the kid tosses in a muddy kickball, which lands on his mom’s white sofa. Trying to recover it, {0.SimFirstName} lets the other balls fall. The kids crack up. Mom doesn’t.
Good call. After {0.SimFirstName} gets a drink, {M0.he}{F0.she} feels much better and the notes just seem to fall into place. There’s no stopping {0.SimFirstName} now!
Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} receives a huge tip and is even hazily visible in an industry magazine photo!
That won’t be the only postponed lesson. After an hour of dabbing at the keys with a dish cloth, {0.SimFirstName} is forced to admit that the piano needs to be professionally serviced. The instrument will be unplayable for a while.
The crowd is insulted. A lady in a purple pants suit yells, “We’re not all deaf!” She gets more laughs than {0.SimFirstName} does.
It should be written somewhere: never side with the establishment against your own fans. {0.SimFirstName}’s fans storm out and smash {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation on every message board and social site they can think of. Why do fans get so angry??
That hole that {0.SimFirstName}’s been digging? It’s getting deeper. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} about to try more new material when people start yawning, stretching and claiming it’s time to turn in.
{0.SimFirstName}’s new jokes work! Most of the time that is. And the adrenaline of taking a risk makes {M0.him}{F0.her} come off as fresh and confident, which everyone loves. {0.SimFirstName} wins!
The problem with covers is that someone has always played them a little better. You know, like the rock legends who created them. {0.SimFirstName} gets polite applause, and is promptly forgotten.
How dare {0.SimFirstName} insult the dignity of animals by laughing at their expense! The crowd is generous with their disapproval and stingy with their donations. {0.SimFirstName} donates part of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay to make up for it.
The starlet berates {0.SimFirstName} for ditching the charity, and frets that the choice will taint her impeccable reputation. The tip money {0.SimFirstName} hoped for goes to the starlet’s publicist to clean up the mess.
So it turns out {0.SimFirstName} does not remember how to juggle. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should stick to more mature crowds. At least there’s fewer spitballs.
Without a target to mock, the crowd settles down and {0.SimFirstName} gets to leave in one piece. Too bad {M0.his}{F0.her} rep takes the hit for the incomplete set.
Best to play it safe. {0.SimFirstName}’s routine goes fine without the joke, and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is none the wiser. Besides, there’s always tomorrow.
Well, the club was empty, but {0.SimFirstName} got in a great practice run and killed the butterflies in {M0.his}{F0.her} stomach. Of course with no one in the audience it’s hard to know which jokes would have gotten laughs…
This is embarrassing. {0.SimFirstName} {M0.splits his pants}{F0. snaps her shoulder strap} the instant {M0.he}{F0.she} sits down at the piano bench, which is made worse by the fact the piano is center stage. The crowd politely pretends not to notice, but {M0.he}{F0.she} will still have to pay a tailor to fix the borrowed {M0.tux}{F0.gown}.
The owner stares and shrugs. “Times are tough,” is all {0.SimFirstName} can get from her. Until she cancels {0.SimFirstName}’s next show, anyway.
Well, that is nice of {0.SimFirstName}. Too bad the old-timer forgets to give the piano bench back, not to mention the bread in the jar. Maybe there’s another piano bar somewhere?
The great thing about launch parties is that companies go all out. After a long night of great food and great music, no one remembers {0.SimFirstName} at all, except the host, who is perfectly happy to sweep the whole thing under the rug.
Whew! That did it. The crowd snaps to attention and even laughs, inspiring {0.SimFirstName} to deliver one of {M0.his}{F0.her} best performances yet.
Sometimes the best thing is to have a little laugh at your own expense. {0.SimFirstName} admits to forgetting and moves on to something {M0.he}{F0.she} does remember, saving {M0.his}{F0.her} act and rep.
Perseverance pays off! Suddenly the section clicks. There’s no stopping {0.SimFirstName} now!
Well, that didn’t go well. Instead of praising {0.SimFirstName} for caring enough to call, he berates {M0.him}{F0.her} for being a fake and pulls the ad. The silver lining? The client keeps quiet to protect his own rep, which protects {0.SimFirstName}’s as well.
{0.SimFirstName} walks out, but the fans don’t follow. After all, they kinda like this club. Where’s all that {M0.fangirl}{F0.fanboy} outrage when {M0.he}{F0.she} really needs it?!
Phew! It worked. {0.SimFirstName} gets a big laugh and has won over the crowd. It’s smooth sailing from here.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t make much of a mark on this movie, but it’s always neat to see your name in the credits!
This tack seems to calm the bride for now. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} has been cultivating {M0.his}{F0.her} repertoire. {M0.He}{F0.She} has just enough acceptable material to fill the hour before the bride turns her daggers on the arriving band.
The owner apologizes for the mistake and sheepishly writes {0.SimFirstName} a new check. {0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} comic skills to help her laugh it off.
It seems like everyone is humming {0.SimFirstName}’s tune! Or maybe, it’s the other one…but {0.SimFirstName} likes to believe it’s {M0.his}{F0.hers}. Not many people are buying drills, but the client chalks that up to a glitch in the rotor.
Somebody else alerts the prodigy, and he finds a new shirt in time. His audition is mind-blowing, while {0.SimFirstName}’s is quickly forgotten.
Practice makes perfect. And judging by the audience response, {0.SimFirstName} is closer to practice than perfect. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should have played something a little darker? Suffering goes well with coffee.
The prodigy’s audition is quite impressive, but his disheveled appearance is deemed unsuitable and {0.SimFirstName} wins the spot.
Nothing’s funnier than a roast, when it’s done right. {0.SimFirstName} turns the hack into a real laughing stock and wins the competition.
Nice try. The child throws a wild temper tantrum and the mother shoos the kid’s outside, but not before staring daggers at {0.SimFirstName}. Hey, it’s the kid’s party. He can cry if he wants to.
{0.SimFirstName} just learned one of the most important lessons of live performance. Yelling at angry people just makes them angrier. Where is that back door again?
Well, the payday will be nice, but the corporate crowd could not be less interested in {0.SimFirstName}’s act. Worse, {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is absolutely livid that {0.SimFirstName} backed out of his party at the last second.
Luckily, the cellist thanks {0.SimFirstName}. He’s had a bit of a head cold and was losing focus. They practice the piece again and this time everything sounds beautiful.
Nothing’s worse than a sore loser. The least {0.SimFirstName} could have done is make the accusation funny. The crowd turns hostile, and no amount of “what’s up with so-and-so” jokes can bring them back around.
A stringy kid and his mom ask {0.SimFirstName} if {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} ever considered playing birthday parties. Time to find a backup band!
The bassist is too dazed to notice. {0.SimFirstName} capitalizes on the crowd’s attention by pounding out an epic ballad of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, winning some new fans.
The crowd boos and starts throwing things at the stage. Bombarded by lipsticks and lighters, {0.SimFirstName} beats a hasty retreat backstage, where {M0.he}{F0.she} is promptly fired by the headliner’s manager.
A check is a check. {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t get to hear {M0.his}{F0.her} material on TV, but when the MC’s performance falls flat, {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t take the hit for it, either.
YES! Everyone enjoys {0.SimFirstName}’s well-crafted set, but the gross-out act was very polarizing. That means {0.SimFirstName} gets the win easily.
Wow! {0.SimFirstName} has never had such an enthusiastic crowd. Turns out this assembly of family and friends has a wicked sense of humor! {0.SimFirstName}’s friend is furious to be humiliated at his own wedding, but {0.SimFirstName} has some great new material to play with now.
Lucky for {0.SimFirstName}, the bride turns on the groom instead, who apparently was supposed to send the playlist. Whoops! The groom is awarded a slight reprieve as the photographer arrives to whisk the bride away. For the moment, all is well.
The director refuses. He loves the score as it is now, but he does promise to make sure the credit goes where it belongs: to {0.SimFirstName}’s colleague only.
Silence. {0.SimFirstName} flubbed it! One point, Funny Guy. Zero, {0.SimFirstName}. This is going to be a long night.
Bravo! This wins {0.SimFirstName} big points with the crowd at the bar, and the old pianist repays the favor by referring {0.SimPronounObjective} to a talent-agent connection of his. {0.SimFirstName} leaves with stars in {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes.
