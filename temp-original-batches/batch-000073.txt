Ask About Triple Boost Week
Greetings, This Event period is being celebrated with Boosts! All the Boosts! Ask me for a Boost, and I shall bestow upon you the one which you desire.
Triple Boost Week is here, but it won't be available for long... Take advantage of the wondrous boost I have to offer!\n\nTruth be told, I fancy myself a bit of a matchmaker. To that end, I've brought along a boost to all of your relationship gains. No matter if your relationship is passionate or platonic, I'm here to help. Simply ask for my boost and you'll be making friends... or friends with benefits... in no time. Now get out there and turn on the charm!
Triple boost week has arrived again, and the clock is ticking on your time to take advantage of these marvelous boosts.\n\nI present to you an intriguing proposition... Do you rocket your Satisfaction Points upwards with a 3x boost to all points gained when completing whims? Or, do you slow down all need decay by 3x, effectively giving yourself more free time to do with as you please?\n\nThe choice is yours! Ask for a boost and I'll happily grant it. Remember, you can change your active boost at any time - I'm always just a phone call away.
Hey there little one! What's that? You want to know about this Triple Boost Week you keep hearing adults whispering about? I'm not sure I should be the one to explain the birds and the bees...\n\nActually, hold on. I've got a special version of this week's boost I can offer you. Just ask me for a boost to relationship gain and you'll find that you'll gather friendship with others three times faster. Why not try it out right now? Grab my boost and scamper along to the playground; you'll have new friends to play with in a snap!
I'm here to help you eat better food, stink less, and express yourself more! Ask for a boost and I’ll happily grant it for a healthy length of time. Of course, you can change your boost at any time. Just call me and ask for another.\n\nI have three options! You can improve your gardening and cooking skill gain – yum yum! Alternatively, you can increase your handiness, painting, and photography skill gain to help you dabble in the arts. Or perhaps you simply wish to spend more time outside? No worries, I can reduce your hunger and hygiene decay. So, what’ll it be?&#xD;&#xA;
Ask About PlantSim Challenge

The type of bean they give you will be based on their current emotion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once you find a bean, place it into a Magic PlantSim Stump (There's one in your inventory!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once six unique beans are placed, you will be able to water the stump, and find out what magical things may grow!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
