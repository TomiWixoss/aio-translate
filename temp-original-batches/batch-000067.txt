{0.SimFirstName} jumps off the bench, shouting, “Gross! What WAS that?” But apparently, everyone already knows and they think it’s hilarious that {M0.he}{F0.she} sat in it. {0.SimFirstName} goes to change into {M0.his}{F0.her} gym clothes for the rest of the day. How embarrassing.
{0.SimFirstName} places {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe carefully over the bib and grabs it when no one is looking. The new kid is so relieved and grateful, he gives {0.SimPronounObjective} his teething biscuits as a thank you.
{0.SimFirstName} scribbles a note and passes it back to the kid: “Stop or I’ll tell.” The kid wads up the paper and fires it at {0.SimFirstName}, but it misses and rolls up to the teacher’s feet. Furious, the teacher sends them both out into the hallway.
{0.SimFirstName} glances over {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulder and slides quickly under the bleachers, wedging {M0.his}{F0.her} body into a nice shady spot. {M0.He}{F0.She} watches for Kenny, the kid ahead of {0.SimPronounObjective}. Many restful minutes later, {0.SimFirstName} shimmies out, finishing {M0.his}{F0.her} “last” lap with a groan. Best P.E. ever!
{0.SimFirstName} runs into the hall, shouting, “Fluffy is loose!” Soon the lab is packed with kids on a rescue mission, and the gerbil is recovered in no time. Before {0.SimFirstName} shuffle away, the teacher stops {M0.him}{F0.her} and removes gerbil-handling rights for the rest of the year!
Just as {0.SimFirstName} has feared, the teacher scolds {0.SimPronounObjective} for {M0.his}{F0.her} carelessness and makes {0.SimPronounObjective} come back at recess to take the test again. Angry, {0.SimFirstName} fills in a pretty pattern, not even looking at the questions.
{0.SimFirstName} picks a seat way in the back where the girl won’t go (too far from the board). Of course, now all the cool kids in the back of the room want to copy off of {0.SimFirstName}’s work!
{0.SimFirstName} walks over and taps the girl on the shoulder, then whispers into her ear. The girl rolls her eyes. “I know, Stupid,” she shouts. She and her friends start to laugh while {0.SimFirstName} shuffles away. How come {M0.HE}{F0.SHE}’s the one they’re making fun of?
{0.SimFirstName} makes up something about a one-person game and turns the {M0.boy}{F0.girl} away. Then, when {0.SimFirstName} goes to join the game {M0.his}{F0.her} other friends are playing, they turn {0.SimPronounObjective} away! Hmm...probably a lesson in there somewhere...
{0.SimFirstName} throws {M0.his}{F0.her} plane out on the playground, where the wind lifts it high. It does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing next to the slide! All of {0.SimFirstName}’s friends want {0.SimPronounObjective} to teach them {M0.his}{F0.her} new design.
{0.SimFirstName} was asked to collaborate on the score for an upcoming summer blockbuster, but has missed a few of the sessions. The soundtrack that the director selects doesn’t reflect any of {0.SimFirstName}’s contributions. {M0.He}{F0.She} could say nothing and just enjoy the movie credit, or demand that the director change the score.
{0.SimFirstName} is MCing a celebration at a retirement community when the mic goes out. Silver, blue, and pink-haired heads are shaking and a few people holler, “We can’t hear you.” {0.SimFirstName} can try shouting {M0.his}{F0.her} routine, or give up and cue the piano player.
A local animal shelter has invited {0.SimFirstName} to MC their fundraiser, but {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot to prepare! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} mine the internet for animal jokes, or wing it and hope for the best?
All the critics are talking about a new young prodigy, who is auditioning against {0.SimFirstName} for a performance with a highly esteemed orchestra. The prodigy arrives with a large stain on his shirt, which he doesn’t seem to notice. {0.SimFirstName} has already performed and could tell him. Or not.
{0.SimFirstName} is halfway through {M0.his}{F0.her} opening set when the bassist for the headliner staggers out and starts taking over the show. He’s on his third 8-minute solo and the clock is running out. Does {0.SimFirstName} cut him short, or roll with it to protect the gig?
There’s a joke in {0.SimFirstName}’s routine at the expense of a friend who’s stopping by tonight. Taking it out will make the routine a little thin, but {M0.he}{F0.she} is not sure how {M0.his}{F0.her} friend will take it.
{0.SimFirstName} auditions for a TV ad and gets the part… of a singing vegetable. What’s worse, the lyrics aren’t even funny. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} stick to the script, or try to spice things up?
Who knew a little bubble gum, fishing line, and cotton balls would be such a hit with the guests?
Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} should have passed on the bubble gum, fishing line, and cotton balls. The guests hate the improvised pieces, and so does the client.
The imported juice costs the bar some money--but it's so popular that business is better than ever!
{0.SimFirstName} shells out the cash for the expensive imported juice, but customers don't like the drinks {M0.he}{F0.she} makes with it.
Perfect! A microwave can be a great time-saver.
Nuke It
Remake the Dish
Ask Chef
Serve It
Whoops! The dishwasher malfunctioned. Now {0.SimFirstName} has to wash all the dishes by hand--and clean up a sudsy mess.
Whew! {0.SimFirstName} is lucky. Even overloaded, the dishwasher worked--the dishes are clean now, and {0.SimFirstName} is back on track.
Make Improvised Centerpieces
Go Without
Dish Undercooked!
An unhappy customer has sent back a dish that's undercooked--and inedible. {0.SimFirstName} can handle this one of two ways:  either nuke it in the microwave or make the dish over from scratch.
Cheese Shipment Smells Funny
{0.SimFirstName} knows that fancy cheeses sometimes smell a little...ripe, but this latest shipment really stinks! Should {0.SimFirstName} ask the chef to take a whiff or just go ahead and serve it?
Centerpieces Haven't Arrived!
{0.SimFirstName} is catering a huge party for a prominent client. Everything's going swimmingly until {0.SimFirstName} realizes that the centerpieces haven't arrived! {M0.He}{F0.She} can improvise something or go without and hope no one notices.
Cash Shortage
It's finally the end of {0.SimFirstName}'s shift, but {M0.he}{F0.she} can't go home yet--the cash register's short. {0.SimFirstName} knows this wasn't {M0.his}{F0.her} doing and has to decide to either report {M0.his}{F0.her} Co-worker or keep quiet about it.
Too Many Dishes
Uh oh! Dirty dishes are piling up, and {0.SimFirstName} can't keep up. {0.SimFirstName} can either overload the dishwasher or give up and leave some dishes unwashed.
Raving Fan
{0.SimFirstName}'s newfound fame behind the bar does have its downsides:  as the bar staff prepares for a long night slinging drinks, a raving fan bursts in, causing commotion and demanding an autograph. Will {0.SimFirstName} sign or kick out the out-of-line fan?
Crazy Fan
{0.SimFirstName}'s newfound culinary fame does have its downsides:  as the kitchen staff prepares for service, a raving fan bursts in, causing commotion and demanding an autograph. Will {0.SimFirstName} sign or kick out the out-of-line fan?
Important Critic
{0.SimFirstName} notices the kitchen staff whispering and asks what's going on. As it turns out, an important restaurant critic has just been seated. {0.SimFirstName} can either show off {M0.his}{F0.her} chops by serving Lobster Thermidor, a signature dish, or mac and cheese, the critic's favorite comfort food.
Exotic Juice
{0.SimFirstName} notices that a competitor has begun serving a fancy, imported juice in their drinks. It's expensive, but clearly customers love it. Should {0.SimFirstName} import the exotic juice, too, or keep using local juices in {M0.his}{F0.her} drinks?
Mythical Drink Guide
On an otherwise uninteresting day, an unbelievably old man with an unbelievably long beard walks into {0.SimFirstName}'s bar. Under his arm is a dusty tome which the man says is a mythical drink guide that all the mixologists in town would love to get their hands on. He's selling it for a pile of Simoleons. Should {0.SimFirstName} buy it or not?
Add Extra Juice
One of {0.SimFirstName}'s regulars is asking for a bit more juice in his drink. {0.SimFirstName} wants to give it to him, but knows {M0.he}{F0.she} should say no.
Keep Quiet
Report Co-worker
Even though {0.SimFirstName} is polite when {M0.he}{F0.she} declines to put extra juice in the drink, the customer gets angry and demands to see the manager, who takes his side.
When {0.SimFirstName} politely declines to put extra juice in the customer's drink, the customer demands to see the manager. Luckily, she takes {0.SimFirstName}'s side.
The fan screams, &quot;You're the best!&quot; after getting his autograph and leaves, but it takes the bar a while to recover and get drinks made on time.
Overload the Dishwasher
Leave Dishes Unwashed
After giving a little extra to the regular, everyone else starts asking for more juice, too, which costs the bar money. But everyone loves {0.SimFirstName}!
The fan screams, &quot;You're the best!&quot; after getting his autograph and leaves, but his disturbance causes dinner service to be delayed.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with the cheese--it's SUPPOSED to smell like a case of rotten eggs. Now Chef is angry that {0.SimFirstName} wasted his time. 
Chef sniffs the cheese and confirms that it's supposed to smell like a case of rotten eggs. Alright, then!
Maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have spoken up after all -- when the boss finds out there's money missing from the register, he makes the staff pay it back to him from their tips.
&quot;Oh, yeah? Well, your drinks aren't so great anyway,&quot; yells the fan as {0.SimFirstName} nudges him out the door. &quot;Worst juice in town!&quot;
The bar staff all heave a sigh of relief and thank {0.SimFirstName} for helping them get back to work.

The kitchen staff all heave a sigh of relief and thank {0.SimFirstName} for helping them get back to work.
&quot;Oh, yeah? Well, your food isn't so great anyway,&quot; yells the fan as {0.SimFirstName} nudges him out the door. &quot;I've gotten better Lobster Thermidor from a drive-thru!&quot;
&quot;While I assumed that {0.SimFirstName} would attempt to dazzle me with a complicated recipe, I was surprised to be served mac and cheese. While it was not an adventurous dish, it did remind me of the food my mom used to make.&quot;
Sometimes, it's good to know your limits. {0.SimFirstName} leaving a few dishes unwashed isn't the end of the world.
Guests ask about the missing centerpieces, and {0.SimFirstName} has to issue a refund for them.
{0.SimFirstName} turns down the old man's offer, sensing there's something a little… funny about him. A week later, there's a news report about a charlatan trying to sell a bogus drink guide to mixologists all over town.
&quot;{0.SimFirstName}'s Lobster Thermidor is edible, but reductive. I was expecting excellence and was disappointed with this meal.&quot;
&quot;The distinctive flavors, creamy texture, and glorious presentation of the Lobster Thermidor should be enough to inspire a discerning Sim to visit {0.SimFirstName}'s restaurant.&quot;
Not only is {0.SimFirstName} out of a stack of cash, but the only recipe {F0.she}{M0.he} finds in the guide that looks interesting turns out to be a foul-tasting dud.
It took a stack of cash, but {0.SimFirstName} is excited to find a new recipe in the drink guide that will impress {M0.his}{F0.her} customers and hopefully give the business a jumpstart.

{0.SimFirstName}'s Co-worker, feeling a bit sheepish, apologizes for the mistake and promises to be more careful in the future.
It seems this isn't the first time the register has come up short. After being fired, {0.SimFirstName}'s Co-worker yells at {M0.him}{F0.her}.
Not only does everyone love the cheese, but guests begin asking for seconds. Apparently this stinky cheese is a hit!
