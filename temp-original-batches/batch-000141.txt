Social
Sims are social creatures that need to interact with others. Invite over a friend, chat someone up on the computer or phone, or just stop a neighbor walking by on the street.
Hygiene
Even Sims need to freshen up from time to time. A quick shower or bath will keep the stink away.
Hunger
Like all living creatures, Sims need sustenance. Have a meal, order pizza, or grill something delicious.
Fun
Everyone needs some fun in their lives, even Sims. Find a TV, play some chess, or of course, play a video game!
Energy
Coffee can stave off the sandman for a while, but eventually all Sims need their zzz's.
Bladder
Need to pee? Send {0.SimFirstName} to the bathroom to avoid catastrophic humiliation!
