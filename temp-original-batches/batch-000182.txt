Who could blame the thief after all?
The thief had the right intentions, but the wrong methods.\n\nAs a fan of time, they wanted to bring everything from the past to preserve in the present, and keep for the future.
{0.SimFirstName}’s boss seems embarrassed and avoids talking to {M0.him}{F0.her} for the rest of the day. Hopefully this won’t factor into any performance ratings.
{0.SimFirstName} takes the cautious approach and waits to see if the start-up has what it takes to succeed. By the time it’s clear that they do, everyone has caught on and the opportunity to get in early is lost.
{0.SimFirstName}’s early investment is just what the start-up needed to complete their first deliverable. Now they’re the talk of the business world and everyone wishes they had gotten in early.
{0.SimFirstName} may have put too much faith in the start-up. It seems that the extra pressure of having a famous investor behind them was too much to handle. The start-up crashes and burns along with {0.SimFirstName}'s investment.
{0.SimFirstName} is able to close a deal which will surely lead to massive profits!
{0.SimFirstName}’s offer is refused because a competitor has already offered them a higher price. This missed opportunity will not reflect well on {M0.him}{F0.her}.
The owners of the business are so ecstatic that they share some promising new ideas they were planning to implement. {0.SimFirstName}’s kindness looks like it will pay off well in future profits!
{0.SimFirstName} is too busy running a business to be bothered with a vanity project like this. {M0.He}{F0.She} goes back to analyzing spreadsheets.
Upon release, {0.SimFirstName}’s book shoots to the top of the best-seller list, displacing the Gobias CEO’s #1 spot. With all the positive attention, {0.SimFirstName} sees shareholder confidence soar! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} will use the profits from the book for a nice vacation.
Upon release, {0.SimFirstName}’s book is universally panned. Shareholder confidence is shaken and {0.SimFirstName} will have to field embarrassing questions about the book for the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} life.
{0.SimFirstName} takes the critical board member out to lunch to discuss their concerns. After some friendly conversation, compromises are made on both sides so that they can put this disagreement behind them.
During the next board meeting {0.SimFirstName} directly addresses the critic's concerns. {M0.He}{F0.She} makes a compelling case for why {M0.his}{F0.her} vision is the right one for the company and the critic is silenced.
During the next board meeting {0.SimFirstName} directly addresses the critic's concerns. Unfortunately, nobody seems convinced and {0.SimFirstName} is forced to make some concessions regarding {M0.his}{F0.her} plans for this quarter.
{0.SimFirstName} catches some flak for hiring an outsider, but nobody can deny that the new applicant is a perfect fit for the position. {0.SimFirstName} is congratulated for keeping the company fresh and increasing productivity.
Not everyone reacts well to {0.SimFirstName}’s decision to hire an outsider. Although the new hire is performing well, employee morale has taken a hit. {0.SimFirstName} will have to figure out how to regain the trust of {M0.his}{F0.her} employees and boost morale.
Promoting from within will ensure a smooth transition since the loyal employee already has relationships with the people they will be working with. {0.SimFirstName} is congratulated for keeping things running smoothly and promoting internal talent.
{0.SimFirstName} takes on the new job. There's plenty of room to move up at the new company, so {M0.he}{F0.she} should expect a promotion soon!
Loyalty can be a good thing. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss catches on to the offer and gives {0.SimFirstName} a bit of a cash bonus as extra incentive to stay!
The game is always more important than the press!  {0.SimFirstName} has a wonderful match, but has left the ownership cold at their lack of media decorum
{0.SimFirstName} answers every question thoughtfully and articulately, then pulls a muscle thirty seconds into the game, and is sore for the rest of the day.
{0.SimFirstName} stands still and watches as security goes after the thief. I mean, that's their job after all. It's back to doing the laundry for {0.SimFirstName}...
{0.SimFirstName} rushes down the hall after the fleeing fan. {M0.He}{F0.She} reaches out for their arm, but catches onto the stolen t-shirt instead. The Sim hesitates briefly before letting go of the shirt and running away. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} got the shirt because on second glance it's clear that this is the star player's lucky shirt!
{0.SimFirstName} starts to cough meekly and sits down on the bench. The crowd reacts to the lack of entertainment with a chorus of boos.
{0.SimFirstName} walks out onto the floor and starts to dance. The crowd looks on uneasily for a moment before one brave fan runs onto the floor and starts dancing beside {0.SimFirstName}. Masses of fans hit the floor and the stadium bursts into a giant dance party!
“Fine! There’s no rule that says the coach can’t take the kick either!” The coach rumbles onto the field, and the team is promptly disqualified, as there is in fact such a rule. At least it wasn’t {0.SimFirstName}’s fault!
The animal legs are a daunting hindrance, but {0.SimFirstName} strikes the ball cleanly, and the kick is good! {M0.He}{F0.She} is carried off the field by cheering fans!
{0.SimFirstName} stumbles as {M0.he}{F0.she} approaches the ball, and falls face first while taking the kick. It’s not even close. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should have taken the costume off first...
Sometimes you need to know when you’re beat. {0.SimFirstName} kicks back and enjoys the chance to watch the rest of game, even though their team loses.
{0.SimFirstName} gives it {M0.his}{F0.her} all to the point of exhaustion, but nothing short of a natural disaster is getting the crowd back into a frenzy. Still, ownership noted the effort and was extremely pleased!
{0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} might be over-reacting. While the crowd certainly wants a fight, {0.SimFirstName} won’t give in to the pressure; {M0.he}{F0.she} IS a professional after all.
No stupid lemur’s stealing {0.SimFirstName}’s dignity! {M0.He}{F0.She} takes them out hard, and the crowd goes WILD! {0.SimFirstName} is fined by the league, but the morale boost {M0.he}{F0.she} gave the team was enormous!
{0.SimFirstName} concocts a beverage using some salt, sugar, and fruit. This {0.SimLastName}ade is surprisingly tasty, and the team loves it!
It’s just water, salt, and lemon, right? Apparently not. The team refuses to drink the concoction, and many dehydrate.
Good ol’ water. Plain, reliable, liquid. It gets the hydration job done well enough!
{0.SimFirstName} greedily grabs the cake and proceeds to eat it very slowly. Savoring each and every bite. This decision will definitely have negative consequences, but {M0.he}{F0.she} sure is one happy Sim right now.
{0.SimFirstName} respectfully refuses the cake offered to {M0.him}{F0.her}. It was the proper course of action, even if {0.SimFirstName} is now filled with an immense sadness.
{0.SimFirstName} strides out onto the stage and begins flexing. The judges look carefully at {0.SimFirstName} before holding up their assessments. 7-6-8. Not winning scores. Better luck next time.
{0.SimFirstName} applies the new tanning lotion before stepping out into the spotlight. The judges are so awed by the sight of {M0.him}{F0.her} that they immediately stop The BIG Contest and declare {0.SimFirstName} the winner. What was in that lotion?
{0.SimFirstName} begins {M0.his}{F0.her} routine and things are going smoothly. When suddenly, pressure builds inside {0.SimFirstName} then promptly releases itself. The gym erupts into pointing and laughing. So embarassed by the spectacle, {0.SimFirstName} quickly exits the premises.
{0.SimFirstName} rushes to the bathroom and prepares for battle. Despite overwhelming opposition, {M0.he}{F0.she} emerges triumphant! {0.SimFirstName} then channels the energy of victory into the greatest work out of all time!
{0.SimFirstName} can be quite persuasive when {M0.he}{F0.she} chooses to be. The star insists it was all just a bit of joking and pledges to lay off from now on.
The star scoffs at {0.SimFirstName}’s accusation, then turns around and complains about {0.SimFirstName}'s performance to the coaches. What a jerk...
{0.SimFirstName} decides to just put up with the obnoxious star’s nonsense, and ends up in a very bad mood.
{0.SimFirstName} decides against taking the unknown beverage.  Who needs vaguely citrus flavored chemicals to feel good anyway?
The drink is delicious!  {0.SimFirstName} feels energized and ready to attack the day with a renewed, citrusy vigor!
The drink tastes like having your brain smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.  {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t feel too good…
