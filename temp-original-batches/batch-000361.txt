Rummage for Info
{0.SimFirstName} found some juicy information on the Sims that live here. With a little effort, {M0.he}{F0.she} could spin it into a fairly compelling article.
Rummage for Food
{0.SimFirstName} found some food in this trash can. It still seems edible-ish.
Rummage
No fresh trash to rummage.

Reminisce
{0.SimFirstName} apologizes for not having the skills to fix the station and sends a message from the rocket to headquarters. It'll be a few days before help arrives, but the astronauts should make it, assuming no one hogs all the blankets.
{0.SimFirstName} blasts off—and just in time, too! An army of spider-like aliens has covered the hillside and fires at {M0.his}{F0.her} retreating ship. Safely in space, {0.SimFirstName} goes to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot…Bingo! {0.SimFirstName}—and the treasure—are on their way home.
With determination, {0.SimFirstName} stabs a finger down onto the button that jettisons all of the trash out of the rocket. Wait, what was {M0.he}{F0.she} supposed to be doing? Oh no!! The government can follow that trail of garbage RIGHT TO {M0.HIM}{F0.HER}!!
{0.SimFirstName} approaches one of the more clear-headed looking crew members and asks what's going on. It turns out that the entire crew has contracted some sort of space-induced madness! {0.SimFirstName} sneaks back to the rocket to contact command. Someone will be up shortly to help the crew.
Eureka! The hat goes on the head! More cheers spew forth from the crowd as {0.SimFirstName} rifles the hat into the stands with a flourish, to be caught by one lucky fan. The hatless pedestal sinks and disappears into the ground, and is shortly replaced again. This latest test pedestal appears to hold a chair: a simple, metal chair.
{0.SimFirstName} squeezes in behind the controls and pilots the little craft down the mountain. And by “pilots,” I mean “rolls.” And by “mountain,” I mean “insanely sharp rocks.” The good news is that a component not unlike a catalyzer lies in the wreckage. The bad news is that {0.SimFirstName} is now clutching a pretty bad gash in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. Night is falling.
Deep in the Evil Cave, {0.SimFirstName} encounters {M0.his}{F0.her} ultimate challenge: Nega-{0.SimFirstName}!! It is the opposite of everything {0.SimFirstName} stands for! Luckily {0.SimFirstName} brought that weapon, so {M0.he}{F0.she} quickly dispatches it and heads for the surface. Now the creature can help you get home!
No two space duels begin the same way, but this alien seems to have a plan. With a wave of his tentacles, he zips off toward the horizon, then turns his starfighter to face {0.SimFirstName}’s. {0.SimFirstName} does the same, pauses, then veers back to charge the alien ship. This duel is on!
The lab is full of geodes and oozing, shimmering specimens. This is some serious science right here. {0.SimFirstName} starts going through the specimen jars when {M0.he}{F0.she} feels a rumbling from the belly of the ship. What was that?!
On {M0.his}{F0.her} way over to the planet, {0.SimFirstName} gets more details from Dispatch. It seems that a colony on Planet Hiattooine’s moon is threatening to revolt and start their own government. Negotiations have broken down, and since neither side will talk to the other, it’s up to {0.SimFirstName} to mend the rift. Who will {M0.he}{F0.she} talk to first?
Grasping the pipe tighter, {0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door and swings wildly. Something small and orange scampers behind a crate. Scanning the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees that a display for a taxidermied alien {M0.he}{F0.she} found is empty! “Don’t hurt me!” a tiny voice cries. Four eyes peek from behind the crate. {0.SimFirstName} lowers the pipe.
{0.SimFirstName} opens throttle around the final bend, dusting Red Tooth and Dog Girl. This is it: time to show the galaxy what {M0.he}{F0.she} is made of. But then over the roar of {M0.his}{F0.her} engines comes a high-pitched whiz as Dog Girl blasts into hyperspeed. Is that legal?! Dog Girl takes first—this time.
{0.SimFirstName} decides to skip the propaganda and get the story from the colonists first. The instant {M0.he}{F0.she} lands on the yellow moon, {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship is surrounded by a mob of angry-looking colonists. Claiming that the planet government is oppressive, they plan on sabotaging the planet’s food replicators to make only non-grilled cheese. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
{0.SimFirstName} should have known that the alien &quot;statue&quot; was too good a bargain. The creature isn’t dead—it’s just a stupid juvenile that was dared by its big brother to pretend. Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy and a free lift home. {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} could get charged with alien-napping, but it’s hard to refuse 4 pleading eyes…
After crossing over via the other ship's airlock, {0.SimFirstName} looks around and realizes that this must have been a science vessel - machines, sparkly rocks, plants, microscopes…yup, definitely science-y stuff. Where should {M0.he}{F0.she} explore next?
What’s the use of thrusters if you never get to use them? {0.SimFirstName} blasts {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters and rockets ahead, leaving Dog Girl, Red Tooth and everyone else in the dust. Nice win! Prize money in hand, {M0.he}{F0.she} hightails it out of there—not that any disgruntled losers could catch {0.SimPronounObjective}.
The voice returns. &quot;Your call is important to us. Would we play this music to you if you were not important to us?&quot; The infuriating music seems to get louder. It has been 0.00003% of one galactic cycle.
{0.SimFirstName} asks the child what planet they're on, but before the child can answer, an army of spider-like aliens appears behind it. Dodging laser fire, {0.SimFirstName} leaps into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship and blasts off. {M0.He}{F0.She} sustains a few hits to {M0.his}{F0.her} landing system, but escapes. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the GPS working again in time to steer home.
The probe is traversing the lunar landscape with agility and style! From {M0.his}{F0.her} tiny porthole, {0.SimFirstName} can see the droid having more fun than {F0.she}{M0.he}'s had in years. Luckily, it should at least bring back a souvenir.
Trying not to panic, {0.SimFirstName} scans the horizon for familiar stars. There! A flashing light. {M0.He}{F0.She} zooms closer only to discover a mysterious glass canister with what looks like a message beacon inside. Extracting it, {0.SimFirstName} finds a map with an X marked on a planet near the constellation’s head. It’s almost too good to be trusted… What now?
{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's robotronic arms to take apart the escape pod. An extra voltrofibrilator and a spare dehexythermomatic gauge will really come in handy someday!
Cruising slowly now, {0.SimFirstName} glides over miles and miles of thick jungle. At last! A clearing. But the clearing seems to be cluttered with alien ruins. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} land there anyway, where there’s less chance of crashing, or opt for the dense, dark cover of the jungle?
Bleep! Bleep! {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship has detected an unexpected object on the horizon. As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} can't believe {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes. Green, billowy treetops. Crystal blue streams. Could it be? The mystical Lush Planet! {0.SimFirstName} switches off {M0.his}{F0.her} turbo boosters as {M0.he}{F0.she} breaks through the planet’s atmosphere.
Passing the planet Yaaaaaaang, {0.SimFirstName} sees a weary-looking alien standing amid a huge pile of trash bags and rusty futon parts. Turns out he's moving to a new pad on the planet Rompiter, and his friend who was supposed to help just bailed! {0.SimFirstName}'s got some extra time - should {M0.he}{F0.she} pitch in?
Nice try, spacesuit! {0.SimFirstName}'s pretty sure {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} be fine without it! Spacesuits are a conspiracy by the fiberglass industry anyway. {M0.He}{F0.She} puts on a nice knitted hat and applies some sunscreen, then heads for the airlock door. But it's locked.
The camp is very busy, and it IS a matter of life or death. {0.SimFirstName} waits for the right chance, then slides the needed part off of a junk pile while the little creature is distracted. Before the theft can be discovered, {M0.he}{F0.she} runs off in the direction of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Time to make repairs and get home quickly!
{0.SimFirstName} sends a message of peace to the creature, who responds by flashing brightly green. It leads {0.SimFirstName} around to a hole in the asteroid, which {F0.she}{M0.he} can see is glowing with beautiful gems. {0.SimFirstName} grabs a few and stores them on {F0.her}{M0.his} ship.
The fighter leads {0.SimFirstName} out of the nebula, but then loops around to get a missile lock on {M0.his}{F0.her} ship! Quickly, {0.SimFirstName} shifts into hyperwarp and escapes. That's when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that the ship automatically picked up some mysterious cargo in the nebula. What could it be?
After wrestling with the strange and slippery creature, {0.SimFirstName} manages to wrangle it into a big specimen jar. {M0.He'll}{F0.She'll} take it back to Earth with {M0.him}{F0.her} for scientists to dissect. Err, &quot;study.&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} wanders through the cloud. The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic—an exquisite dream, or luxurious grave. {M0.He}{F0.She} is at peace with the beauty of {M0.his}{F0.her} lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into clear sky. {0.SimFirstName}'s free! And there before {0.SimPronounObjective} is a strange golden planet.
The creature offers {0.SimFirstName} a special treasure for passing the trials. Then, {0.SimFirstName} watches in amazement as the creature points to the rocket, which seems to lift out of the swamp as if guided by an invisible force! Now {0.SimFirstName} can finally fly home and leave this weird planet far behind {M0.him}{F0.her}!
{0.SimFirstName} thinks {F0.she}{M0.he} has done enough. The satellite probably sends out a better signal. Instead of a million Sims without coverage, it’s only hundreds of thousands. That’s a win on some level, right?
{0.SimFirstName} is on {M0.his}{F0.her} way home to deliver the prized pooch and collect {M0.his}{F0.her} reward! The animal under the desk had been Fitz all right, dyed brown in a lame attempt at disguise. But wait—there’s a fighter closing in. Then {0.SimFirstName} realizes: the injection was a tracker. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can outmaneuver them.
{0.SimFirstName} knows better. Battling the black hole’s pull, {M0.he}{F0.she} guides {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket alongside the alien’s and persuades him to abandon ship. The pilot is barely clear when his ship is sucked into oblivion, but he doesn't look too grateful. Giving {0.SimFirstName} a (very) little something for the help, he asks to be dropped at the next planet.
{0.SimFirstName} finally connects with Tech Support. A pre-recorded voice says, &quot;Hello. What can I help you with? You can say, 'ship repairs' or 'space madness.'&quot;
Phew! {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship lands without a scratch and so far, no aliens are running out to greet {M0.him}{F0.her}. {0.SimFirstName} wanders into a half-collapsed temple, which seems to have been constructed of massive, porous rock. More strange space rocks are scattered about, along with a beautiful sacrificial bowl and other religious artifacts. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} bring an artifact home for analysis?
{0.SimFirstName} wanders through the cloud. The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic—an exquisite dream, or luxurious grave. {M0.He}{F0.She} is at peace with the beauty of {M0.his}{F0.her} lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into clear sky. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} free! All {M0.he}{F0.she} needs is a little more luck: {M0.he's}{F0.she's} got to get home on fumes.
{0.SimFirstName} parks {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship and goes into the pound. The alien at the front desk raises an eye as {M0.he}{F0.she} walks in. “Job's filled,” she says. {0.SimFirstName} can explain about the missing dog… or make an excuse to look around.
{0.SimFirstName} is tired. So tired in fact, {M0.he}{F0.she} could fall asleep right here on the 69th floor, if weren't for all the howling. The animals in here are nothing like “Fitzy-Poo.” Finding a stairwell, {M0.he}{F0.she} heads back to the front desk. The alien is gone, but what's that {0.SimFirstName} hears? Whimpering from under the desk...?
Being the supreme deity for an entire civilization seems like a lot of work, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn't think {M0.he's}{F0.she's} up for it. Let someone else deal with the responsibility. {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship and heads for home.
Without light, the aliens can't grow anything or do anything…but neither can {0.SimFirstName}. Sitting in a public restroom in the dark isn't exactly thrilling, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to head for home, having learned exactly nothing about the effects of absolute power.
{0.SimFirstName}'s generosity has allowed the aliens to grow complacent and spoiled. {M0.He}{F0.She} really didn't want this responsibility in the first place, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to get out while {M0.he}{F0.she} still can. As {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves, {M0.he}{F0.she} hears the panicked cries of the aliens, calling out for food, clothing, and medicine. {0.SimFirstName} hopes they'll be okay...
{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's robotronic arms to drag the escape pod on board through the airlock. After a few minutes of banging on the hatch, it pops open - and an alien creature pops out! {0.SimFirstName}'s not sure whether {M0.he}{F0.she} should try to catch it and subdue it, or just shove it out into space.
