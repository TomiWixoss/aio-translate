Picnic Table and Bench with Cushions
It was innovation time at the ol' Picnic and Bench factory. Jimmy Jean, Jeanie James, and Jamie Jim all took turns presenting their ideas for the board, and it was a cushion on the bench that won in the end.
Holiday Table
An elegant table designed for the holidays. Draped with beautiful printed fabric displaying star, snowflake and tree patterns. 100% polyester. Gift wrapping not available.

Faux Fireplace Facades
Tired of smoky residue in your flue, carrying heavy logs to your hearth, and spending unwanted effort on match striking? Put that all aside. Faux Fireplace Facades are the future my friends!\n\nBask in the glow of your imagination, and enter the world of tomorrow.
Garland with Pine Cones
When I was a kid, I always wanted to go to this mythical Gar Land place. I thought it was going to be this incredible fishing hole that only existed in December.\n\nImagine my disappointment. This is nice though yea? Yea. it's nice.
Handcrafted Holiday Etchings
You know how sometimes you go to those import stores, and you find something you know to be handcrafted. And it's marked down half price. And you think to yourself &quot;Is this the find?&quot; And you pick it up, looking for flaws, imperfections, and there are none. And you toss it in your cart, thinking &quot;It is, I found the holiday find!&quot;\n\nYea, I made that.
&quot;This&quot; Centerpiece
A holiday gathering? Of course, but in order to meet your &quot;festive quota&quot; for such a soiree, don't forget your checklist. Finger foods? Lavashly garnished beverages? Live music by an impoverished artist? An abundant supply of garish household décor? No, one can never have too much decor! Add “This” to your collection, and be envied by all!
Mason Jar Holiday Decor
My brother had a jar that he kept a cricket in when I was younger. He punched some holes in the lid, and would drop some grass and stuff in it occasionally, just to keep the little guy happy.\n\nThen he got a lizard. We never saw the cricket again.

Decorative Presents
Decorative Presents. Really? That's like decorative food. What’s the point? There are no calories and the point of food is calories.  If you take the time to wrap a present, put a present in the present! This is just twisted and cruel! Not cool. Happy Holidays?
