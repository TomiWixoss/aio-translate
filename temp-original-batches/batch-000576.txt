{1.SimFirstName} says, &quot;I'm not too familiar with them, but the Envoy who was here kept muttering &quot;Darong...art&quot; repeatedly while searching through the books.&quot;\n\n{1.SimFirstName} continues, &quot;Maybe I should try to look at them, too.&quot;
Noble Sims can't do this. 
{1.SimFirstName}, the Envoy, sighs with relief and smiles as they say, &quot;Thank you so much, {0.SimFirstName}, for not turning me in. I saw an opportunity, and got carried away. Do everyone a favor and look after those treasures. I might pay them a surprise visit one day.&quot;\n\nWith that, {1.SimFirstName} leaves for now...
&lt;font size=&quot;14&quot;&gt;{0.String}&lt;/font&gt;
Emotions get channeled into the melody, and the fireplace flame dances with the rhythm. Something can be seen flickering through the flames.
{0.SimFirstName} remembers the code {0.SimPronounSubjective} found hidden on Cordelia's Statue in the museum and wonders if it's related to the Royal Envoy's plan. {0.SimPronounSubjective} {S0.enters}{P0.enter} the code and voila! The Master Plan file opens and it is shocking. You know, As someone who is trying to commit such a large crime, the Royal Envoy has a terrible understanding of cybersecurity.\n\nThe file reveals all of their plans in detail. It turns out, the Envoy was trying to steal the treasures for themself this whole time, sell them off, and make a massive profit! Wow, it also includes the specs for a massive house with so many hot tubs...\n\nNo wonder the Royal Envoy has been acting so shady. They have been tricking people this whole time! They must be found immediately. This crime cannot go unanswered!\n\n{0.SimFirstName} remembers someone mentioning that the Royal Envoy was running towards the Blue Velvet Nightclub in Willow Creek...maybe they're still there.
{1.SimFirstName} laughed saying, &quot;If you want to find them, look next to the lake. They mentioned taking a one-way trip on the ferry to their new life of luxury and wealth.&quot;
Swordsmanship
Clandestine
What happens on this lot, stays on this lot! Sims can get up to all sorts of scandalous behavior without fear of secrets spreading.
(From Completing the Master of Grudges Aspiration)
What a magnificent work of art, but making art is only the beginning!\n\nKnowing the artist's intent and message is where true art comes to life.\n\nExpressing feelings about it is certainly a good idea. It's what the Darongs would have wanted! You should give it a try!
The Envoy's eyes widen in surprise when {0.SimFirstName} appears.\n\n&quot;Wh- What are you doing here? Listen, please understand this isn’t what it looks like- Oh...you read my master plan. Well, can you blame me?! I'm stretched so thin between these families. What about my happiness?! I just wanted a nice hot tub when I’m done with this job.\n\nListen, if you report me this could cause great upset in the kingdoms. I bet they won’t ever trust you and I won’t be able to show my face again! But if you forgive me and let me go, I promise I’ll just stop and walk away. The Simoleons I would get from these treasures wouldn’t make up for me losing my job and reputation anyway.&quot;\n
The Envoy rushed out and said they would be here at the library.\n\nSurprise them with a question!
