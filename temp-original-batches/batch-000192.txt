Greetings! I am a royal envoy representing the noble kingdoms of the Darong, the Capp, and the Thebe family. I have received word of suspicious activity regarding some of the ancient treasures being kept outside of the kingdoms. I have come to ensure the safety and security of these items. I am hoping to do this as swiftly as possible. I do not want to bother any of the dukes with this matter. They're just so busy, as noble people tend to be. You understand, don't you? \nI need someone trustworthy to help me complete this task and you caught my eye. Would you help me with my master pla- I mean, royal duties? I will make sure it is worth your while.
