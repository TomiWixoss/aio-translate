It appears as if {0.SimFirstName} is having problems with the alphabet. {M0.He}{F0.She} can't seem to get past 'A'! Kudos!
{0.SimFirstName} has returned from school. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s one of the top students at {3.String}. Keep up the good work!
Stellar! {0.SimFirstName} can surely enjoy the weekend knowing {M0.he}{F0.she}'s one of the top students at {3.String}. Perhaps {M0.he}{F0.she} could make some time for some extra-credit assignments, just in case.
There is no better feeling than starting the weekend as a straight-A student. {0.SimFirstName} should feel proud!
One sure hopes {0.SimFirstName}'s weekend plans include focusing on schoolwork. Receiving such low grades could affect {M0.his}{F0.her} future!
Receiving Ds in school is no laughing matter. {0.SimFirstName} should use the weekend to reflect and put some effort towards {M0.his}{F0.her} studies.
{0.SimFirstName} is done with school for the day. A 'B' is not a bad grade, but that doesn't mean there isn't any room for improvement.
School is out for the day. {3.String} is filled with 'B' students. {0.SimFirstName} is one of them. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} could try to distinguish {M0.him}{F0.her}self more?
School's over, and {0.SimFirstName} is not performing so well. As a matter of fact, {M0.he}{F0.she} is performing quite poorly.
{0.SimFirstName} is back from school for the day and {M0.his}{F0.her} report card is riddled with D's. That is surely unpleasant for everyone.
{0.SimFirstName} is done with school for the day. {M0.He}{F0.She} is doing satisfactory work, but {M0.his}{F0.her} teachers at {3.String} think {M0.he}{F0.she} could easily improve with just a little bit of extra effort.
{0.SimFirstName} is back home from school. No need to make room on the refrigerator door... {M0.His}{F0.Her} work is merely satisfactory.
{0.SimFirstName} is back from school. Friday nights are great for turning Bs into As. {M0.He}{F0.She} could focus on that, perhaps.
{0.SimFirstName} is done with school for the week. {M0.He}{F0.She} is doing well, but it wouldn't hurt to go the extra mile. Perhaps the weekend would be a good time to do so.
It's the weekend. {0.SimFirstName} wraps up this week with a 'C' in school. Is that really satisfactory?
{0.SimFirstName} is not the first 'C' student at {3.String}, and {M0.he}{F0.she} surely won't be the last. Wouldn't the weekend be a great time for {0.SimPronounObjective} to bump {M0.his}{F0.her} grades up?
{0.SimFirstName} is failing! {M0.He}{F0.She} needs to take action and turn those grades around if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to have a bright future.
Fs! {0.SimFirstName} is performing extremely disappointingly at school. {M0.He}{F0.She} better shape up soon!
{0.SimFirstName} is failing! {M0.He}{F0.She} should use the weekend to focus on homework. This way, {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll have a shot at not being featured in {3.String}'s infamous Hall of Dropouts.
Another school week is over and {0.SimFirstName} has established {M0.him}{F0.her}self as one of {3.String}'s lowest-ranking students. What a shame!
