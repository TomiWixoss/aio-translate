Vision Of You Mirror
Sometimes a little part of you is not enough. The full body version of our mirror wants all of you, from head to toe. Stand close to it and let it drink in your entire being. It will take everything you have and give back just as good, because it’s a mirror.
The Obverse
Who knows what our reflections do in the shadow universe they inhabit behind the looking glass. All we know is they are always there for us when we stare into that magic pane. Give the other you an elegant view into our world with The Obverse from Reclamation Homeware.
OTP Split Mirror
Function falls madly in love with Fashion in the OTP Split Mirror. Its upper-half perfectly reflects the fashion icon standing before it, while the lower half can be angled to properly inspect shoes and calves. Do we ship this mirror? Yaaaas.
The Food Annihilator
Our microwave will blast your leftovers with radiation so thoroughly and with such intensity that no living thing should approach it for decades. Other microwaves just raise your food’s temperature slightly, but when you want food that’s been permanently sterilized, there’s only one name in the business: FOOD ANNIHILATOR.
The Wavescatter
Built with salvaged materials from discarded 80’s electronic children’s toys and assembled by haphazardly-trained gerbils, the Wavescatter is the perfect microwave for the budget-conscious bachelor who loves his meals burnt on the outside and frozen in the center.
The Omniwaver
For the finest in microwave cooking, it has to be the Omniwaver. This incredible device bombards your food with a previously undiscovered form of radiation. We can’t promise that the omicron waves will cook your food faster, or hotter, than conventional microwaves, but man they really bring out the flavor somehow!
The Schmapple Micro
What if a microwave could give you less of what you don’t want, and more of what you don’t realize you need? Things like a larger viewing area, and three life-changing colors? Well you can have it right now. Introducing: The Schmapple Micro. It’s Microwaves, to the Power of You.
Life Under a Microscope
Ever feel like you were a specimen in a lab, with everyone staring and analyzing and dissecting and judging? Well, now you can study the effects of such behavior more comfortably, from the other side of the lens.
Microphone
The Royal We Microphone
Conquer the comedy circuit behind the Queen’s special microphone. Let's play the crowd and get some laughs!
Meteorite
My word, how rude of that Sim to stand in the way of this meteorite's &lt;i&gt;smashing&lt;/i&gt; performance! It was going to be spectacular, and had to settle for a slightly less graceful landing, but nonetheless! It demonstrated a high caliber of professionalism. And not a single bit of applause from the audience, just a bunch of wailing crybabies who couldn't identify high quality performance art if it flew down from the heavens and bonked them in the head!

Ol' Rusty Mailbox
This quaint little device is called a mailbox. But unlike the mailboxes you might be used to, this one is a literal box with incredibly finite space. Bills and junk mail slowly accumulate inside its small, metal frame, but no one really knows how or why. A fun curiosity for collectors!
