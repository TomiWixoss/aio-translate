If the Mice would just keep it down!
Mice!
Eeek! Aak! These pests made themselves at home!
Made It Worse!
Tried to fix an apartment problem. Tried and failed. Failure.

What an incredible performance! And {0.SimFirstName} was there!!
So Close to the Performer!
{0.SimFirstName} ran to the front of the crowd and got pretty amped up! {M0.He}{F0.She} felt like they were practically on stage! 
Front Row Spot!
{0.SimFirstName} cannot believe {M0.he}{F0.she} is so close to Bebe Rexha right now! AND listening live to a soulful, acoustic rendition of her song Sabotage. While rushing to the front and waving {M0.his}{F0.her} hands in the air might not be appreciated by the Sim behind {0.SimPronounObjective}, this moment is way too magical for {0.SimPronounObjective} to care.
The More, The Merrier!

So... Much... STUFF...
{0.SimFirstName} can't wait to meet the new neighbor's possessions! Wait, no. {F0.She}{M0.He} can't wait to possess the new neighbor's stuff- Errr, uh... Maybe {0.SimFirstName} should just drop in to say hi (and definitely not steal anything).
Filthy
{0.SimFirstName} is very stinky! Bathe them to clean them up fresh!
Grungy
Dirt and mud is just a part of the toddler's life, but a little bath doesn't hurt either.

An embarrassing flop for this amateur escape artist. Better luck next time!
Becomes Food. NOW! in: {0.Timespan}

Ooooh! {0.SimFirstName} thought that combination of flavor and texture was so yummy yum yums!
Food Boredom
{0.SimFirstName} wants to explore new foods, but keeps getting the same tastes and textures over and over.
