When {0.SimFirstName} had service, {M0.he}{F0.she} felt trapped—pressured to to be reachable by phone at all times. Having no reception might be annoying at first, but it sure is liberating! 
A Little Char Adds Character

Sore from Chores
Without clean water, {0.SimFirstName} has to rely on sheer scrubbing force to get the job done. On the plus side though, it's not a bad workout...
