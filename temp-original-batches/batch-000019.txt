The lot placed was created using the &lt;b&gt;&quot;Move Objects&quot;&lt;/b&gt; cheat. As a result, some objects may be located in positions that are inaccessible by your Sims.\n\nUsing Move Objects disables placement rules in Build Mode - even allowing objects to overlap each other.\n\nTry this cheat for yourself:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press &quot;ctrl + shift + c&quot; to open the cheat console.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type &quot;bb.moveobjects&quot; and press enter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\nTo turn the Move Objects cheat back off, open the cheat console and enter &quot;bb.moveobjects&quot; again.
