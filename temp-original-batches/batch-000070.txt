{0.SimFirstName} is too smart for them! That chair is on one of those moving platforms! As the crowd applauds {0.SimFirstName}’s wisdom and foresight, the chair sinks down into the dark recesses in the floor, replaced by the next challenge. This pedestal is made of solid gold, and contains valuable looking jewels!
Disappointed, the alien offers {0.SimFirstName} some choice pieces of space junk if {M0.he}{F0.she} will come back and duel later. Knowing {M0.his}{F0.her} ship isn’t fully equipped to beat this hotshot, {0.SimFirstName} takes the junk and promises to return, once {M0.he}{F0.she} has traded it for some key upgrades. {M0.He}{F0.She} turns {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, relieved, toward home.
{0.SimFirstName} speaks in {M0.his}{F0.her} most comforting, non-threatening voice and explains to the pirates how very disappointed {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} be if they stranded {M0.him}{F0.her} in deep space. But these pirates didn't get where they are by being empathetic, so they tear the wiring out of {M0.his}{F0.her} vermenticular fusion box. Hmm...might be a little hard to land the ship without that.
{0.SimFirstName} and the trader load up the ship and {0.SimFirstName} blasts away. {M0.He}{F0.She} heads for home - it's smooth sailing, there's no traffic in the asteroid belt, and {0.SimFirstName}'s even getting pretty good gas mileage. Plus, {0.SimFirstName} is on track for a sweet payday when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets home! 
{0.SimFirstName} smashes the rebels (quite literally - {M0.he}{F0.she} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe). But with the strongest of the aliens destroyed, things don't look so good for their civilization. {0.SimFirstName} leaves before {M0.he}{F0.she} can be blamed for some kind of extinction event.
When {0.SimFirstName} wakes up, {M0.he}{F0.she} is lying on the asphalt next to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship with a sore arm. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound is locked, and the only response to {M0.his}{F0.her} knocks is barking. On {M0.his}{F0.her} way home, flashes of the incident return: a burly guard, a gleaming needle. Maybe {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} try again another time.
{0.SimFirstName}'s wrath is truly fearsome! The aliens are terrified of their capricious, angry deity. But it turns out that being an angry deity doesn't win you many friends. A few hardy rebels band together to try to drive {0.SimFirstName} away forever. How should {0.SimFirstName} deal with this uprising?
Thanks to {0.SimFirstName}’s focus, {F0.her}{M0.his} aim was impeccable and all the goop was shot off!
{0.SimFirstName} is just biting into {M0.his}{F0.her} astronaut ice cream sandwich when {M0.he}{F0.she} spots a small craft that seems to be hailing {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Is someone in trouble? {0.SimFirstName} blasts in for a closer look.
Ah yes. Turn it off and then turn it back on. The preferred tech solution of professional rocket scientists everywhere. The dynotherms sputter and a new message appears: &quot;Your dynotherms did not shut down properly. Would you like to restart your dynotherms in Safe Mode?&quot;
The guard injects {0.SimFirstName}'s arm with a long shiny needle, then leads {M0.him}{F0.her} into the pound, which consists of floor after floor of caged beasts—mostly large, growling earth mutts. “First 69 floors,” the guard says. {0.SimFirstName} can start looking for Fitz—or look for a way back to that leash at the front desk.
The round ball deftly slides into the round hole, and the room erupts into ferocious applause! {0.SimFirstName} instinctively bows graciously as the puzzle recedes back into the floor, replaced by a new one.  This next rising pedestal has… a hat?  Yes, it’s a very fine hat, perhaps a derby! What should {0.SimFirstName} do?
{0.SimFirstName} wakes up in a groggy haze, covered with freeze-dried crumbs. {M0.He}{F0.She} notices the lights are so BRIGHT in here, and the color of the rocket walls is way too GREEN. This is unacceptable. It'll attract Xargons! How should {0.SimFirstName} avoid the Xargons?
{0.SimFirstName} does {M0.his}{F0.her} best to scale the impossible terrain, but it proves too difficult. {M0.He}{F0.She} resolves to get more exercise when (if) {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back home. The western valley is the only way left to go now, but the light is starting to fade…
{0.SimFirstName} sets to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot. Reboot. Yes! There it is—a signal at last! {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts off—and just in time, too. An army of spidery aliens has covered the hillside and fires at {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Good thing {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got these trusty thrusters. {0.SimFirstName} is free, clear and on {M0.his}{F0.her} way home in no time!
It's been a while since {0.SimFirstName} had to hotwire anything. Wait...does {M0.he}{F0.she} know how to hotwire stuff or was that a guy on TV? Oh well, how hard can it be, right? Now is it red-wire-to-blue-wire, or red-wire-to-green-wire?
Those pathetic pirates practically trip over each other in order to get out of {0.SimFirstName}'s way. But before they go, they wash {0.SimFirstName}'s windshield and give {0.SimPronounObjective} a quick oil change, just to stay on {M0.his}{F0.her} good side.
Using some paper clips, half a box of aluminum foil, and a plunger, {0.SimFirstName} manages to cobble together a new power coupling. Upon installing it, the space station hums back to life. The crew is very grateful.
{0.SimFirstName} acts fast. Heaving the box onto {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulders, {M0.he}{F0.she} crams it into {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo hold, but can’t resist a peek before  working on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Treasure—mounds of it! Someone will be looking for this soon. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} can sense a rumbling in the distance which seems to be getting closer…
One by one {0.SimFirstName} starts ejecting the escape pods from {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, watching them drift off into space. But the ship is still too heavy! Why is it so heavy? Something else has to go. {0.SimFirstName} starts panicking, because if the ship is too heavy it will definitely crash!
Harsh words, insults, and finally, salutations are taken back as the conversation undoes itself. An interesting experience for sure. What happened just before this?
{0.SimFirstName} is still choking on the alien spacecraft’s exhaust when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears sirens blaring in the distance. The space police surround {0.SimFirstName}’s rocket ship and demand to search {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo bay. {M0.He}{F0.She} can turn over the goods and hope for the best, or help the alien—and possibly {M0.himself}{F0.herself}—by hiding it.
{0.SimFirstName} calls out. No answer. The only sound is a soft dripping. Donning {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty headlamp, {M0.he}{F0.she} treads quietly into the tunnel, deeper and deeper until {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a beam of light coming through a crack in the ceiling. Under it is a locked box! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} pry it open here or bring it back to the ship?
{0.SimFirstName} staggers toward {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, one hand dragging the catalyzer, the other gripping the wound in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. It’s not far now, but {0.SimName} suddenly hears a low growl. A very large creature has crept up behind {0.SimPronounObjective}. It’s a mad dash to the safety of the ship! Then again, the catalyzer has a good heft… could be used as a weapon.
So far, so good. Ever since {0.SimFirstName} braced the door, the cargo hold has been silent. If {M0.he}{F0.she} can make it to a pest extermination station, {M0.he}{F0.she} can get the problem taken care of and be on {M0.his}{F0.her} way. But then a new sound starts. Small. Sad. Sobbing? Does {0.SimFirstName} stick to {M0.his}{F0.her} guns, or peek in the hold?
It's Fitz! Before the aliens can stop {0.SimPronounObjective}, {0.SimFirstName} is out the door with the prized pooch and on the way to collect {M0.his}{F0.her} reward! A quick call to the Galactic Rangers on the way should take care of the pound's illegal animal trade.
With the stabilizers {0.SimFirstName} installed, {M0.he}{F0.she} is able to retain some control of the ship. It just barely misses a formation of sharp-looking rocks and lands roughly in a swamp a few miles beyond. Struggling onto dry land, {0.SimFirstName} wonders how {M0.he}{F0.she} is going to get the rocket out of the muck and back into space…
{0.SimFirstName} returns from the jungle with a modest pile of berries. “Know these were poisonous, did you?” the creature asks before shoving several into his mouth. “Mah favrite,” he sputters through a mushy mouthful. The final trial is to explore the Evil Cave. He gives {0.SimFirstName} a weapon, then oddly stresses that {M0.he}{F0.she} will not need it.
As the conversation plays back in reverse, though it sounds like gibberish, {0.SimFirstName} can detect where it all might have gone wrong. What happened just before this?
It's just a person-sized hole in the hull. So it's not perfectly sealed. So it might let in stray meteors and space contaminants. So {0.SimFirstName}'s combustible little body might go up in flames as the ship re-enters the atmosphere. {M0.He}{F0.She} can make this landing, right? Right?
Oh, why didn't {0.SimFirstName} spring for the extra-tacky coating on {M0.his}{F0.her} space gloves? Breathing heavily {M0.he}{F0.she} bounces down the body of the ship, desperate grabs failing to find purchase. Finally {M0.he}{F0.she} gets hold of some cables, ripping the hydraulic line for the ship's stabilizers. The ship automatically activates its emergency beacon.
Ouch. {0.SimFirstName}’s head hurts, and when {M0.he}{F0.she} tries to move, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} handcuffed to {M0.his}{F0.her} pilot seat. A sharp, cold object is poking {M0.his}{F0.her} back. “T-t-take me home,” a voice stammers. It’s oddly deep—and {0.SimFirstName} realizes it’s a juvenile voice trying to sound older. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} comply or try to reason with the juvenile?
Well, looks like even the pound has its processes. Having made up a story about losing {M0.his}{F0.her} mutt, {0.SimFirstName} fills out {M0.his}{F0.her} 13 forms while waiting for an escort to the cages. {M0.He}{F0.She} is handing them in when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a small red leash—much like in Fitz’s photo—sticking out of a box under the desk. What now?
{0.SimFirstName} did what was asked of {0.SimPronounObjective}. There’s no point risking {M0.his}{F0.her} life for cell phone data. As long as this satellite is left unharmed, then it was a success.
Thinking quickly, {0.SimFirstName} offers the child some treasure if it will tell {0.SimPronounObjective} which planet {M0.he}{F0.she} has landed on. Now {0.SimFirstName} can radio in {M0.his}{F0.her} location and get directions home! Rewarding the child, {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts off with the bulk of {M0.his}{F0.her} treasure still intact. Clever!
{0.SimFirstName} sets to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot. Reboot. Yes! A signal at last. {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts off—and just in time, too. An army of spidery aliens has covered the hillside and opens fire. Pushing {M0.his}{F0.her} engines to the limit, {0.SimFirstName} gets free, but not without sustaining a few hits to {M0.his}{F0.her} thermal system. This’ll be a rocky landing…
{0.SimFirstName}'s instruments go haywire and {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship is bathed in purple light. Purple and gold dust coats the sky as far as the eye can see—which isn't that far. {M0.He}{F0.She} must have drifted into a giant nebula! {0.SimFirstName} can send out a call for help, or forge ahead and hope the instruments can sort it out.
{0.SimFirstName} finally returns to the ship, exhausted. The alien part had made a pretty good club, stunning the giant beast with one solid whack. It gave {0.SimFirstName} just enough time to find a place to hide until the injured creature finally staggered away. Now to repair the ship, dress these wounds, and get back home!
This creature is surprisingly slippery, even by slimy alien standards! {0.SimFirstName} just can't keep ahold of it and it gets away and starts chewing through some electrical cables. Hmm… hope {0.SimFirstName} wasn't going to need those cables for the journey home....
Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} scans the wreck, gaining invaluable scientific knowledge. Avoiding the time-edge, {F0.she}{M0.he} safely makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way home.
Ugh, {0.SimFirstName} feels even worse now. This isn't good--it definitely sounds like Space Madness. The next symptom is making really bad decisions. If {M0.he}{F0.she} just concentrates {M0.he}{F0.she} should be okay. Now...how to fix the air flow?
The fresh air really helped, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} feels better. If {0.SimFirstName} actually had Space Madness {M0.he}{F0.she}'d start getting paranoid and making really terrible decisions. Now...how to spend the day up here in space?
{0.SimFirstName} shines {M0.his}{F0.her} flashlight on the cropland, and the plants grow taller than ever! The aliens are so happy that they invent painting, music, and philosophy. With civilization progressing so well, {0.SimFirstName} figures that {M0.his}{F0.her} work is done. {M0.He}{F0.She} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship and heads home.
{0.SimFirstName}'s leg is starting to cramp.  {M0.He}{F0.She} is crouched in the Cosmic Relief stairwell, and {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been watching the front desk for what feels like forever. Finally, the alien stands, scratches, checks something under the desk and seems to say something before waddling off. Gotcha! It's now or never.
After dismantling {M0.his}{F0.her} bunk for extra sheet metal, {0.SimFirstName} patches the hole! The inside pressure stabilizes and it looks like the ship will make it back to Earth! Some of the debris could be valuable... at the very least, {0.SimFirstName} can Internet-shame the litterbug who got {0.SimPronounObjective} into this mess. {M0.He}{F0.She} collects a scoopful and sets course for home.
Hmm, {0.SimFirstName} really doesn't have a big enough cargo bay. The alien's got a lot of incense burners and bottle koozies, and they might not all fit in the ship. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to just cram it in there, or give up?
{0.SimFirstName} slowly opens the door and peers inside. Just then, something soft and squishy thumps onto {M0.his}{F0.her} back and a tentacle threads around {M0.his}{F0.her} neck. “Don’t move!” a small voice whispers. Everything goes black. {0.SimFirstName} faints, which is technically moving.
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't remember much, but thinks {F0.she}{M0.he} may have been abducted! {M0.He}{F0.She} now stands in a small, sterile arena. A motley assemblage of hideous beings sits, furtively, in the bleachers. Slowly, a pedestal rises from the floor; it contains two items: a ball, and a container with two holes, one round and one triangular. The room is tense with excitement.
&quot;Ship repairs,&quot; {0.SimFirstName} carefully enunciates into the comm. &quot;You have selected: Self Destruct,&quot; the voice says, &quot;Remotely engaging your ship's self destruct function now.&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} slides into place at the starting line. To {M0.his}{F0.her} right, a souped up XR315 piloted by a female canine-sapien. To {M0.his}{F0.her} left, a brawny alien revving the engine of his TS-555, his sneer revealing a row of sparkling red teeth. Bang! The starting gun fires and they’re off!
The grizzled old trader has an offer for {0.SimFirstName} - deliver some of his cargo back to Earth, and {0.SimFirstName} can keep some of it! {M0.He}{F0.She} can use it {F0.her}{M0.him}self or make big bucks selling it. The cargo bay is pretty large, so {0.SimFirstName} accepts the offer.
{0.SimFirstName} carefully guides the rocket into orbit over a small alien world, but it’s clear right away that something is wrong. Ionic interference in the planet’s thermosphere is causing havoc with the ship’s primary systems. {0.SimFirstName} decides to attempt an emergency landing, which is smart since {M0.he}{F0.she} has no other choice…
The aliens will never again want for water! {0.SimFirstName} is so benevolent! The aliens sing {M0.his}{F0.her} praises. Now they're praying to {0.SimPronounObjective} for more land for their fields and livestock.
That would explain it. As {0.SimFirstName} gets closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that an alien spaceship is being pulled towards a massive black hole! {0.SimFirstName} offers to transport the owner of the ship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, but the alien begs {0.SimPronounObjective} to save the whole ship. “I’ll reward you! Pleeeeease!” Should {M0.he}{F0.she} risk it?
It’s a tight squeeze, but {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship lands without a scratch. Instantly it’s surrounded by blue furry creatures! They’re small—about the size of a common house cat—but {0.SimFirstName} has never seen anything quite as toothy, and there are hundreds of them. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to capture one alive, or euthanize one and bring it back for analysis?
Promising to infiltrate the government’s food replicators, {0.SimFirstName} blasts off for the planet. As soon as {M0.he}{F0.she} lands, a government official waves {0.SimPronounObjective} in to see the Emperor, Yang Holmby. Warning him of the Rebel plot, {0.SimFirstName} quashes the revolution—and receives a handsome reward for {M0.his}{F0.her} help.
Whoa, that escalated quickly. But {0.SimFirstName}'s quick offensive strike took the pirates by surprise, and they crumble into a teary, blubbering puddle. They even offer {0.SimFirstName} some spare wires and loose change to entice {M0.him}{F0.her} to leave them alone.
{0.SimFirstName} sees a large ship floating silently ahead - it looks abandoned, or at least very poorly maintained. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to board it to see what's inside, or just use the robotronic arm to collect some spare parts from the outside?
After wandering for a very long time, {0.SimFirstName} discovers a wrecked ship similar in structure to {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent}! There’s even a part that could possibly replace the catalyzer! Unfortunately, when {0.SimFirstName} pulls it free, the wreckage shifts and a piece of jagged metal leaves a deep cut in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. Better get back to the ship quickly…
The debris reassembles into a fierce pirate ship, while laserblasts spawn and retract into their respective blasters! An epic battle un-ensues, and the ships drift further apart. Communications become active; what did {0.SimFirstName} say to the pirate captain?!
*Bzzt* {0.SimFirstName}! Come in!*bzzt* &#xD;&#xA;Commander Vanderwander needs {M0.his}{F0.her} help! There is a satellite out in orbit that is malfunctioning. Millions of Sims are complaining about their poor cell phone data coverage! They want to post pics of their food, their kittens, and their profound fortune cookies but can’t! The commander needs {0.SimFirstName} to take a look!
These mountains would break most Sims, but thanks to {0.SimFirstName}’s good physical condition, {M0.he}{F0.she} eventually makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way to the summit. The curl of smoke {M0.he}{F0.she} spotted earlier is pouring from an alien ship! {0.SimFirstName} might be able to pilot it out of here, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could try scavenging a suitable part for {M0.his}{F0.her} own ship.
Praise to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} drags a table near the toilet so the alien colony can expand. Now that the aliens have all the land they need to build and grow, they seem to be doing okay. {0.SimFirstName} leaves on a high note.
This is not going well at all. Dog Girl has taken the lead, but instead of chasing her, Red Tooth seems intent on menacing {0.SimFirstName}, maneuvering to block {M0.him}{F0.her} at every turn. Could they be working together? Regardless, {0.SimFirstName} is tired of looking up Red Tooth’s tail-lights. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to blast him out of the way or play fair?
Since {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.his}{F0.her} way around a machine, it doesn’t take long to figure out the alien components. There’s a part not unlike a catalyzer that should do the trick, and it looks like {M0.he}{F0.she} can still get back to the ship before night falls. Time to head home.
When {0.SimFirstName} clicks the &quot;Update&quot; button to update the dynotherm drivers, a helpful message appears saying the request cannot be completed because the dynotherm drivers have not been updated.
After a long walk, {0.SimFirstName} finally sees signs of life. {M0.He}{F0.She} appears to have discovered a large camp, filled with little creatures bustling about and trading small bits of junk they’ve scavenged from various crash sites. One little merchant near {M0.him}{F0.her} has a part that would be a suitable replacement for the catalyzer. But how to obtain it...?
Oh, all-powerful {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} truly must have a master plan, chant the grateful aliens. They're so happy that {M0.he's}{F0.she's} chosen to help them rebuild their society. Maybe being benevolent is the better way to rule?
{0.SimFirstName} stares down at a formidable tower on a red planet. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound isn’t just a fable. It’s real! {0.SimFirstName} is searching for Mrs. Foozzin’s prized pookapoo—a rare breed of space dog that could bring big bucks on the black market. It will bring big bucks to {0.SimFirstName}, too, if {M0.he}{F0.she} brings it home unscathed.
The old trader's ship is overflowing with cargo--he offers to let {0.SimFirstName} keep some of the cargo if {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll transport the rest to his buyer on Earth. {0.SimFirstName}'s ship's cargo bay isn't very large, and the extra weight could crash {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} risk it, or just take a little bit of the goods?
{0.SimFirstName} suits up, opens the doors, and floats toward the satellite. As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets closer, {0.SimFirstName} notices that there are...sprinkles in the goop? What?! {0.SimFirstName} pulls out {M0.his}{F0.her} space shammy and wipes some off. {M0.He}{F0.She} sniffs it and then takes a taste. It's frosting! {0.SimFirstName} takes a sample for lab analysis (and for a snack) then returns to the ship.
So much better… Free of handcuffs, {0.SimFirstName} sizes up the creature {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} bought as taxidermy—it’s just a stupid juvenile that was dared by its brother to pretend! Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy and a free lift home. {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} could get charged with alien-napping, but {M0.he}{F0.she} did promise…
No one answers {0.SimFirstName}’s distress call. This massive ball of dust and gas must be absorbing all comm signals. There’s nothing to do but forge forward and hope {M0.he}{F0.she} can get free before {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel’s gone!
Well, this is going...not great. {0.SimFirstName}'s ship crashes spectacularly into the surface of the planet. According to the damage diagnostic, the ship won't be safe to fly until {0.SimFirstName} can replace the catalyzer on the port compression coil. It's a nothing part--until you don't have one. {0.SimFirstName} steps out of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and begins the search.
Without water for their crops, the tiny, helpless aliens start to wither away. In order to appease their deity, they start sacrificing some of their pets and livestock at a tiny temple, where they've drawn a crude picture of {0.SimFirstName}'s face.
{0.SimFirstName} pilots {M0.his}{F0.her} ship to a remote rest-stop, but just as {0.SimFirstName} is about to pry open the first crate, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a small red flashing light. A tracker! Just then the alien knocks at {M0.his}{F0.her} window. As the smuggler unloads his stuff, he slips {0.SimFirstName} a small package in thanks before vanishing in a cloud of exhaust.
{0.SimFirstName} sees some unsavory characters approaching fast in {M0.his}{F0.her} rearview mirror...uh oh! Those are space pirates, and {0.SimFirstName}'s about to be shipjacked. They demand a suitcase full of Simoleons to let {0.SimFirstName} pass...OR ELSE.
{0.SimFirstName} waits for the alien to search her computer for record of Fitz, the pookapoo. Apparently nothing comes up. The alien hands back the photo and claims to have dogs to feed. But she doesn’t get up. {0.SimFirstName} notices a small red leash—much like in Fitz’s photo—sticking out of a box under the desk. What now?
Correct! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} zooms through the cosmos, and approaches an unknown vessel. Communications open; what should {M0.he}{F0.she} say?!
Turns out it IS that kind of race! {0.SimFirstName} gets a lock on Red Tooth and fires {M0.his}{F0.her} ion cannons, sending Red Tooth’s TS-555 hurtling off the track. {0.SimFirstName} easily closes the distance between {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and Dog Girl, blasting past her for the win and the top prize!
{0.SimFirstName} maneuvers the ship into the path of the space rock. With some clever flying, {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to deflect the asteroid off the ship's plating, causing it to fly harmlessly back into space. That was close!
The tank is no match for the powerful laser on {0.SimFirstName}'s rocket. ZZZZZT! It incinerates in a cloud of metal dust. Looks like {M0.he's}{F0.she's} outsmarted the government agents on {M0.his}{F0.her} trail. What's {0.SimFirstName}'s next move in this high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse?
{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} surprise advantage to land the first hit, but it goes downhill from there. Note to self: never duel an alien with 14 more hands than you! The extra-handed extraterrestrial unleashes a wall of missile fire, and judging by the smoke and warning lights, {0.SimFirstName}’s ship has been hit! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} retreat, or fight to regain {M0.his}{F0.her} edge?
