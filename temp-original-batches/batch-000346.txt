Activities include: Gardening, Swimming, Catching a Frog, Interacting with Campfires, Beachcombing &lt;i&gt;(Island Living)&lt;/i&gt;, and Skiing or Playing in snow &lt;i&gt;(Snowy Escape)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI love rocks and grass and sand and bugs and the sun and pretty much anything that's outdoors! I should do a bunch of stuff outside, just to prove to myself and others how outdoorsy I am!
&quot;An Outdoorsy kid like me should really do a bunch of outdoorsy things to show just how outdoorsy I really am.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Set {1.Number} pranks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nSomeone is going to fall for my pranks for sure! And it'll be soooooo funny! I bet they'll be really confused! Haha!
&quot;Hehe. I'm going to prank &lt;i&gt;so many&lt;/i&gt; things!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Do Pranks {1.Number} times. Tip: Mischief Pranks can be found in the Mischief Pie Menu category on another Sim.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI love a good &quot;got 'em&quot;! This is going to be so much fun!

Tip: Find the Stories Pie Menu category in the Friendly and Funny categories.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI know some of the &lt;i&gt;bestest&lt;/i&gt; stories there ever were! This one time...
&quot;I know some good stories. I should tell them to a bunch of Sims!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Have Sims nearby watch when {0.SimFirstName} Sings with a Microphone or plays on the Piano or Child's Violin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI can be super entertaining when I want! Watch me! La, la, la, la!
&quot;I've gotta find someone who will watch me play my instrument!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Do Homework when {0.SimFirstName} receives it in {0.SimPronounPossessiveDependent} inventory.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nHomework can be pretty tough, but if I'm going to be a good student then I'm going to need to do it. I'm sure I could get some help if I really needed, but I could probably do it all on my own too! I just hope there isn't too much!
&quot;I should do my homework {1.Number} times. That'll show that I am the best student, for sure!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Do Homework after School, go to School in a good Mood with Needs filled, and make good choices while at School.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI think an A or a B would prove that I'm a pretty good student! If I study hard and make sure I'm ready for school each day, I think I can do it!
&quot;I want to get at &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; a B in school, but an A would be even better!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Do physical activities that build Motor Skill like playing on the Jungle Gym {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nGo ahead! Throw any challenge at me! I can climb anything, race faster than any other kid! Look at my muscles! Raaaar!
&quot;I can prove how strong and fast I am! Just watch!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Become Friends, Best Friends, or BFF with an Infant Sim by succeeding when socializing with them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThey may be littler than me, but I think we're going to have something special! Someday they'll grow up and be just as old as me! And then we'll be the best of friends! I wonder if they'll remember all of our good times together?
&quot;I want to be an Infant's favorite Sim! At least, &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of their favorite Sims!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Interact with an Infant, a Toddler or a Newborn and Chat or play Peek-a-Boo {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nLook how little they are! I love hearing baby giggles and babbles! I bet I can get good at making them happy too!
&quot;I bet I could get along really well with a real live baby!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Use the Phone or a Camera to take a photo. Then go to {0.SimFirstName}'s inventory and choose to Sell to Publication {1.Number} times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nReal, grown up Photographers make money when they sell their photographs! I might just be a kid, but I bet I could make Simoleons too! I'm going to prove it, and then that'll prove that I'm a real, professional photographer!
&quot;I bet I could sell my photographs just like a real grown up photographer!&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Use the Phone or a Camera. Focus on a subject and take {1.Number} photographs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nLet's see! There are a lot of things out there that'd be very fun to take a picture of! I wonder what things are the most artsy? Maybe I could get someone to pose for me like a model!
&quot;I should practice my Photography by taking a bunch of pictures of Sims and other artsy things.&quot;
\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#2182E6'&gt;Order from {1.Number} different Market Stalls.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\nI have a &lt;i&gt;fancy&lt;/i&gt;...what's that word? Pallen? A palert? A palette? Anyways, it's pretty much the fanciest and most &lt;i&gt;extinguished&lt;/i&gt; of all time.
&quot;I'm going to try food and drinks from &lt;i&gt;pretty much&lt;/i&gt; everywhere!&quot;
