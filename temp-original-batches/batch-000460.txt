Items that support Off-the-Grid gameplay can be found in their own Off-the-Grid category in Build Mode. This section can be accessed within the Objects by Function drop down.\n\nAnywhere within Build Mode, Water and Power objects that have unique Off-the-Grid functionality are marked with a “Functional Off-the-Grid” tooltip note when you hover over them.
To apply the Off-the-Grid Lot Trait go into Build Mode and click on the Venue Info button in the top left corner. Open the Traits Panel from the pop-up menu. Then, click on the Off-the-Grid icon to slot it into your active lot. 
When Power or Water utility is acquired as a surplus on an Off-the-Grid lot, Water and Power objects will function normally again.\n\nWhen this happens, a new interaction will appear on Functional Off-the-Grid objects to Turn On/Off Utility Usage. Toggling this option allows the player to determine which objects will pull from the excess utility and which will solely retain their Off-the-Grid functionality. 
The Off-the-Grid Lot Trait disconnects a lot from the utility grid. Most objects that require Power or Water will not work, supporting interesting new story themes and challenging gameplay elements. 
Playing on an Off-the-Grid lot means access to new gameplay elements!\n\n• Click on a grill or Off-the-Grid supported oven to view exclusive recipes. Some require ingredients and provide powerful moodlets.\n• Water utility can be collected from various locations around the world.\n• Functional Off-the-Grid objects have unique interactions that allow them to fulfill needs.\n• Add Ice to supported Fridges. Just be sure to replace the ice before it melts!\n• Bills on Off-the-Grid lots do not charge for Water or Power utility. They also provide a Tax Break discount!
Sims Sessions
Speaking of where, Magnolia Blossom Park in Willow Creek is the place to be for the festival!\n\nThere are many ways to get there. Select the festival ticket in your inventory, it has an option to travel. You may get a phone call invite to attend the festival, or you can travel from the phone menu, or by zooming out and selecting the travel button. Then select Willow Creek, and find Magnolia Blossom Park. It will be the one with the animating music button over it!
Sims Sessions are only available for limited time engagements!\n\nFestivals normally take place every in game Sunday at 12pm during their real time window! Don't worry if you miss a Sunday, the festival occurs every Sunday within it's limited real time window.\n\nIf for some reason the festival hours change, check the ticket in your inventory for all the latest details on when and where.
The Sims Sessions music festival has come to town!\n\nIt's a place to enjoy exclusive musical performances by top name artists. Where you can hang out all day, and in to the night. Soaking in the music, atmosphere, buying swag, eating your favorite festival foods, or just celebrating with friends!\n\nIt's sure to be the summer hit!
It's performance time! Gather around the stage, get hyped for your favorite performer, and enjoy the music!\n\nIn between performances, be sure check out the area - we've got bathrooms, food stalls, tents to nap in, and there are sure to be plenty of other Sims around to socialize with.\n\nAnd don't worry, you'll know when the next performance is about to begin... so, don't miss out!
Stop at the Festival Shop for some limited time swag, like fan and festival t-shirts! Grab a snack at the food stall, we're sure one of those are your artists favorite snack!\n\nOr you can bring your own collectibles and crafted items to stock the crafting table with, and sell your merchandise to the other festival goers!
Lot Challenges
You can change the Lot Challenges in the Venue Info panel in Build Mode. We've moved some classic Lot Traits such as Off-the-Grid to a new section of this panel dedicated to challenges. Check them out by clicking on the trophy.
Lot Challenges change up the experience of playing on a lot, adding an element of difficulty. The challenges are stackable so you can mix and match to cater to how you want to play. Apply as many Lot Challenges as you want and share your favorite combinations with other players when you upload the lots to the Gallery.
Fishing Skill
Increasing your Fishing skill will unlock Fish with Bait and increase the likelihood of catching bigger and better fish.\n\nProTip: There are some fish only found in hidden locations.
Fishing Holes can be found all over the world. Click on the Fishing Hole and begin Fishing to raise your Fishing skill.\n\nFishing skill is also improved by Fishing, and Reading about Fishing.
Fears
Every time your Sim wakes up while having a Fear, they will have a chance to get a confrontation goal to appear. Helping your Sim complete this confrontation goal will help them overcome their Fear. Some Fears may take multiple confrontations in order to be fully removed.\n\nWhen your Sim overcomes their Fear they will become proud of what they did and the Fear will be removed from their traits! \n\nYou can also purchase a &quot;Fear-Be-Gone&quot; potion from the Reward Store to quickly remove a Fear that your Sim has gained.
With Wants making a comeback, so are Fears: \n\nFears are traits that your Sim may obtain through gameplay. Sound a bit vague? \n\nHere is an example of a possible Fear that your Sim may get! Let's just say for some reason your Sim caught on fire and survived. Well, that can be quite terrifying and your Sim will most likely gain a Fear of fire.\n\nThere are numerous ways of getting a Fear on your sim and each one will have an interesting effect on how your Sim behaves in the world. Be careful! Sims are not limited to just one Fear at a time.
What are the consequences of having a Fear trait on your Sim? Well, it will depend on what Fear your Sim gets. Fears will come with permanent negative effects until your Sim is ready to overcome them. The effects will vary and are not limited to: negative moodlets appearing, higher chances of failing interactions, and some changes to their behavior in certain situations.\n\nThat sounds awful! Don't worry, Fears are meant to be overcome! It may take some time and hard work, but you can help your Sim overcome their Fear when the time is right!
Environment Effects
Some decorative items will affect your Sim's current emotion. For example, if a painting is inspiring, have your Sim view the painting to become inspired.\n\nNote: An objects catalog hovertip will inform you if it will have an emotional impact on your Sims.
Sims are affected negatively by things like dirty dishes, broken household items, and puddles. 
Experiment by designing rooms in your Sims' homes to improve their moods when creating, exercising, and more!
Groups
You can start a Group by selecting another Sim, selecting Actions, and Add to Group. Disbanding the Group or Removing Sims from the Group can also be found in Actions.
Groups will automatically be formed when you travel with other Sims, or Invite them over to the current lot. Dates will also form an exclusive Group for the duration of the date!
Sims love to do things together, and what better way than to do them in a Group? Group behavior is much easier to control and more visible than ever.
Sims in a Group will be represented by a clear Icon over their head. You can have up to eight Sims in a Group.
Death
Upon death: the Grim Reaper comes to usher them from the game, leaving behind a memorial Urn or Gravestone which nearby Sims can use to mourn.
Sims can die if their Needs are neglected for too long, if they push their Sims too far down an emotional path, or as the result of failing certain risky interactions.\n\nOr fire. Fire can kill too. Yep, fire.\n\nI mentioned fire, right?
Dying isn’t the end! When Sims meet their untimely (or timely) demise, a Sim can begin a new chapter by becoming a Ghost.\n\nBy choosing &lt;b&gt;Become a Playable Ghost&lt;/b&gt;, the Sim will remain in the Household and continue to be playable as a Ghostly presence.\nChoose &lt;b&gt;Become a Freeroaming Ghost&lt;/b&gt; if you would prefer this Sim &lt;i&gt;live on&lt;/i&gt; as a Ghost in an unplayed Household. These Sims will no longer be a played Sim but can still be found in the World.
Plan Outfit will take you to Create a Sim, however you will not be able to edit some parts of your Sims.\n\nYou can modify Outfits, Accessories, as well as Hair.
Outfit Planning
When you are done modifying your Sims, click the Play button to return to Live Mode.
Body &amp; Facial Modifications are off limits.\n\nThe Muscle and Fat sliders in Create a Sim update based on your Sims experiences, you can see how your Sims are doing.
Click on your Sim or a Dresser and choose Change Outfit... to change the outfit your Sim is currently wearing.\n\nTo modify the outfits, click on a Dresser and choose Plan Outfit.
Changing Outfits
Sims will &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; their Outfits to suit different &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;situations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, such as wearing their Swimwear when going in the pool, but you can also &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; their current Outfit yourself. This is great for storytelling and screenshots!\n\nIf your Sim has aged up and you’re not a fan of their new clothes, or you’re just looking for some change, you can &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;customize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s available Outfits.
To &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;change&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s current Outfit, either click on the Sim themselves and choose Outfits &gt; Change Outfits, or interact with a mirror and choose Change Outfits.\n\nTo &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;customize&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim’s Outfits, interact with a mirror or dresser and choose Change Sim. This will open Create a Sim. When customizing an already existing Sim, you can change things like their clothes and hair, but not sculpt their face and body, or change their Traits.
Careers
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Business app&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on your phone has a lot of useful functionality. Here you’ll find options to take a vacation day, quit, or get a new job.\n\nOnce your Sim becomes an Elder, you can use the Business App to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;retire&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. They will get a pension every day, based on their salary. Freedom at last!
