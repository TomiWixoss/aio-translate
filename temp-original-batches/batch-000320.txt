&lt;b&gt;Romantic Boundaries&lt;/b&gt; control what does or doesn't make Sims experience romantic Jealousy. By default, all Sims experience Jealousy if a partner engages in any kind of romance with other Sims. You can change this!\n\nRomantic Boundaries can be configured in the &lt;b&gt;Identity Panel&lt;/b&gt; in Create A Sim. The first three settings control if your Sim experiences Jealousy when a partner engages in certain types of romantic interactions with other Sims. The settings are:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-physical romance&lt;/b&gt;, which is any romance where the Sims' bodies do not touch. These can be found in the &lt;b&gt;Affection and Flirtation&lt;/b&gt; categories of the &lt;b&gt;Romance&lt;/b&gt; interaction menu when you select another Sim.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical romance&lt;/b&gt;, under the &lt;b&gt;Physical Intimacy&lt;/b&gt; category of the Romance interaction menu. This setting controls Jealousy caused by a partner having romantic physical contact, but &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; include Mess Around (Teen Sims) or WooHoo (Adult Sims.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The third setting specifically covers &lt;b&gt;Mess Around&lt;/b&gt; (for Teen Sims) or &lt;b&gt;WooHoo&lt;/b&gt; (for Adult Sims.) These interactions are also found in the Physical Intimacy category.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The last setting says if a Sim is &lt;b&gt;Exploring Romantic Boundaries.&lt;/b&gt; If the Sim is exploring, they may reconsider each of the three boundaries listed above, by talking about it with other Sims in Live Mode. If the Sim is not exploring, their boundaries are firm and they cannot be asked to reconsider.\n\nUse these settings to decide how Jealousy does (or doesn't) unfold in Live Mode.

Pronouns
Name &amp; Age
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Name&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; your Sim! Who are they? Click on the text to expand the Name panel, and type in First and Last names for the Sim. No idea what to name your Sim? Click Randomize Name and let us pick one for you!
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Age&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or Life Stage, is set in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Identity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; menu. Select their Life Stage, from Infant to Elder.\n\n\nKeep in mind that changing a Sim’s Life Stage might remove their Traits, Aspiration, and Relationships if they’re no longer valid.
Gender &amp; Sexual Orientation
There are powerful ways to customize a Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sexual Orientation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Sexual Orientation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is also set in the Customize menu under the Gender buttons. It's available for Sims who are Teens or older.\n\nYou can set which gender(s) a Sim is attracted to &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;romantically&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (who they can build a romantic relationship with) and which gender(s) they’re interested in &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Messing Around&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or having &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Woohoo&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with. \n\nFor example, to make a biromantic and asexual Sim, set them to be romantically attracted to men and women, and to be interested in Woohoo with no gender.\n\nYou can also decide if a Sim is &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;exploring romantically&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; if not, they will turn down advances from Sims who aren’t of the gender(s) they’re attracted to.
A Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Gender&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be set in the Identity panel. If the Sim is a Teen or older, you can further customize their Gender by selecting the Customize button below the Gender buttons and opening the Gender tab.\n\nIn this menu, you can select your Sim’s Physical Frame (their basic body shape); their Clothing Preference (this determines the preset filter when editing Outfits, but you can always remove these filters); whether your Sim can become pregnant, get others pregnant, or neither; and if your Sim can use the toilet standing up or not.
You can change your Sim’s &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Pronouns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the dropdown menu next to their name. Expande the Name panel to access it. If no Pronouns are selected, Pronouns in texts will be based on your Sim's Gender.\n\nPick between the preset Pronouns, or create &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;Custom Pronouns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The latter option will open the Custom Pronouns window. Use the example sentences below each version of your Custom Pronouns to make sure it will work correctly in text.
Create a Ghost
Ghost Sims can be customized to wear any regular outfits available for living Sims, in addition to those exclusive to Ghosts! From casual wear to formal, the choice is yours to give your Ghost Sim a unique and personalized look that reflects their otherworldly style.
In Create a Sim, you now have the option to create a Ghost! Next to the Aspiration trait icon, you'll find a new molecule that lets you choose from various death types. To revert your Sim back to a living state, simply select the 'X' on the cause of death icon. Please note that Toddler and Infant Sims cannot become Ghosts, and certain death types are restricted to specific age groups.

Identity &amp; Personality
In addition to creating your Sims’s appearance, you can customize their &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;identity&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;personality&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! \n\nThis covers everything from Age, Gender, and Sexuality to Traits and Aspirations.
