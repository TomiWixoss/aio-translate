On {M0.his}{F0.her} latest op, {0.SimFirstName} has recovered a stolen thumb drive. But what to do now? Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take it back to the Agency to maintain cover, or let it slip to the enemy and try to impress {M0.his}{F0.her} new Evil boss? 
Missing Package
The agency realizes there's a mole in the organization. {0.SimFirstName}'s not a suspect—in fact, {M0.he's}{F0.she's} chosen to head up the hunt. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} find a scapegoat to preserve {M0.his}{F0.her} covert status, or should {M0.he}{F0.she} pretend to come up empty-handed?
OMG! It's Lobro!
Say Something
Ignore It
The agent was captured and interrogated, and now everyone’s at risk. It’s all {0.SimFirstName}’s fault. 
Although {0.SimFirstName} saved the agent’s life, {M0.his}{F0.her} superiors are angry because the entire mission was worthless. Now they have nothing, and the enemy is on to them.

{0.SimFirstName} is working on a big Doomsday presentation for the annual Gathering of Supreme Villains, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} stuck on one slide of the deck. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t know whether to anchor the presentation with a simple, straightforward transition, or go for a big reaction with something unexpected. 
As {0.SimFirstName} prepares for {M0.his}{F0.her} undercover mission, {M0.he}{F0.she} learns that {M0.he}{F0.she} can choose {M0.his}{F0.her} own disguise this time, because no one will recognize {0.SimPronounObjective}. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} put together a disguise that’s super-attractive, or super-boring?
Getting to seduce the most attractive informants isn’t the worst part of {0.SimFirstName}’s job. But during one particularly amorous evening, {M0.his}{F0.her} spy phone begins to buzz. To distract {M0.his}{F0.her} target, should {M0.he}{F0.she} counter with some whispered suggestions into {M0.his}{F0.her} target’s ear, or try to slyly turn the phone off? 
{0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} team are performing a standard contraband search. With just two rooms of the house to go, the suspect returns—earlier than expected. {0.SimFirstName} has to make the call to either search the basement or the attic, but they don’t have time for both. 
There’s an important op coming up. {0.SimFirstName} can’t decide which agent to put on the case—the brash young hothead who doesn’t play by the rules, or the quiet bookworm who’s dependable and responsible?
While working an assignment, one of {0.SimFirstName}’s agents has his cover blown. Protocol says to pull the agent from the field immediately, but the agent wants to finish the job. Should {0.SimFirstName} order him to escape, or let him finish? 
The agency organized a day of friendly physical competition, but {0.SimFirstName}’s biggest work rival is using some really dirty tricks. {0.SimFirstName} needs to win, and make it look fair. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} use a few dirty tricks of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, or keep it clean?
While performing a routine background check, {0.SimFirstName} runs into an unexpected firewall. Hmmm…{M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t think the information {M0.he}{F0.she} needed was going to be protected. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either hack through the firewall to dig deeper, or call in a senior agent for help.
While doing some routine skulking, {0.SimFirstName} overhears intel about a hidden cache of stolen Simoleons. A little off-the-books op might be just what {M0.his}{F0.her} bank account needs. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} look for it {M0.himself}{F0.herself} or report it to {M0.his}{F0.her} handlers? 
The normal tactics aren’t working on a particularly tough suspect. {0.SimFirstName} needs to “enhance” this interrogation—should {M0.he}{F0.she} play the Good Cop or Bad Cop? 
At the dead drop site, the package {0.SimFirstName} is supposed to retrieve isn’t there. That’s odd…and concerning. Should {0.SimFirstName} leave the scene like {0.SimFirstName} had been instructed, or lie in wait for a few minutes to see what’s up? 
While browsing the booths at VillainCon, {0.SimFirstName} runs smack into Lobro—Supreme Villain extraordinaire and {0.SimFirstName}’s personal hero. OMG OMG OMG! Once {M0.he}{F0.she} calms down, {M0.he}{F0.she} can either ask for an autograph or just play it cool and walk on by.
It wasn’t easy building a perfect baby’s bottom out of such square boxes, but {0.SimFirstName} pulls it off. The design is the talk of the day…until an excited child pulls the wrong box. Down they come, burying the poor kid and his mom in not-so-cushy diaper boxes, which the manager winds up giving the enraged mother for free.
What’s the point of knowing stuff if you never actually use it? {0.SimFirstName} recommends the less expensive brand, pointing out how there’s really no difference in features. {M0.He}{F0.She} even paraphrases the tagline on the brochure, “The suction doesn’t suck.” The customer is so impressed with {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty, she praises {0.SimPronounObjective} to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss. Nice!
Wow! {0.SimFirstName}’s design is certainly attracting attention. It wasn’t easy creating the perfect curves of a baby’s bottom with such square boxes, but facing the pink sides out was kind of brilliant. The TushyCush display quickly sells out!
{0.SimFirstName} points to the more expensive machine, assuring the customer that there’s really no question. Boom! Another SoilSport sold. Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t work on commission, but {M0.his}{F0.her} manager definitely takes notice of {M0.his}{F0.her} fine upsale skills.
This person couldn’t possibly lie. {0.SimFirstName} smiles graciously and accepts the return without a receipt. Before {M0.he}{F0.she} can ask the grateful woman to fill out their online survey {M0.he}{F0.she} sees {M0.his}{F0.her} manager’s dark look. Happy customers, angry boss... But {0.SimFirstName}’s glad {M0.he}{F0.she} helped {M0.his}{F0.her} customer.
This person probably isn’t lying, but {0.SimFirstName} mutters something about store policy and turns the customer away. {0.SimFirstName}’s manager watches the customer go and grumbles, “Nice try, lady.” He compliments {0.SimFirstName}’s good work. Doesn’t feel good, though.
Well, diapers are all about tidiness, after all, and cubes are nice and sturdy. No one wants some fancy store display toppling over on a kid. {0.SimFirstName} sticks with the cube and the diapers see some pretty decent business.

Store Policy
{0.SimFirstName} is hopeful. The customer stepping up to {M0.his}{F0.her} support desk already looks a little defeated. “I’d like to return this? But I don’t have the receipt?” she mumbles. {0.SimFirstName} starts to point to the “No Receipt, No Return” sign, but it’s so refreshing not to be screamed at. Shouldn’t {M0.he}{F0.she} be nicer to people who are nice?
Store Display
{0.SimFirstName} has been put in charge of the front display! Now {M0.he}{F0.she} can show {M0.his}{F0.her} manager what {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} really made of. Unfortunately, today’s Special Item is TushyCush Diapers. Ugh! Should {0.SimFirstName} just stack them in a neat cube or try a more…inspired design?
Question of Price
A customer asks {0.SimFirstName} for some additional information on two different steam cleaners. {0.SimFirstName} is familiar with both brands—DirtSquirter and SoilSport—and they are pretty identical, except for the price. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} help the customer save money, or plug the pricier brand?

Neglecting gardening chores does not please the farmer. He's scared that he'll lose some of his harvest. Another move like that and {0.SimFirstName} will be kicked out of {M0.his}{F0.her} residency.
Word about the bribe gets out. Even though the positive review was truthful, {0.SimFirstName}'s reputation is tarnished.
{0.SimFirstName} writes a balanced review, critiquing the work's shortcomings but also complimenting some of the artist's better choices. Even the artist appreciates the fair assessment.
Everything is perfectly in proportion. Who needed a model anyway?
That guerilla street artist, working on the side of trains, is the talk of the art world. With sponsorship from {0.SimFirstName}, the artist buys enough paint to tag the police station and every parked car on the street. {0.SimFirstName} is implicated in the redecoration of the city.
{0.SimFirstName} gets an incredible offer for {M0.his}{F0.her} collection! Who cares how the museum displays it! 
With all {M0.his}{F0.her} expertise, {0.SimFirstName} manages to convince art lovers that there's no replacement for the human eye. 
It turns out {0.SimFirstName} makes a better painter than a canvas. The body art winds up looking muddled and splotchy. The magazine cancels the shoot anyway.
The &quot;{0.SimFirstName} Honorary Wing&quot; has skylights, sparkling marble floors and a life-size statue of {0.SimFirstName} at the front doors. Perfect.
Whoa! Why is the room upside down? {0.SimFirstName} doubles down and finishes mopping the ceiling before the end of {M0.his}{F0.her} shift.
The top comment on the article says, &quot;Obviously, {0.SimFirstName}'s scathing review of 'Call Me: The Artist Built With Smartphones' is the most biased piece of journalism ever written. {M0.he}{F0.she} couldn't make it in the pop art world and now {M0.he's}{F0.she's} jealous.
What a power purchase! Maybe the money {0.SimFirstName} saved can go toward framing and hanging the piece.
No one asks {0.SimFirstName} to move, and {M0.he}{F0.she} sells ten pieces before the fair closes. Not bad!
The site owner is so grateful to {0.SimFirstName} for correcting the mistake that she offers {0.SimFirstName} a 20 percent discount on {M0.his}{F0.her} next purchase.
{0.SimFirstName} loves the exhibition anyway, so the review is truthful. And now {M0.his}{F0.her} work will enjoy a little extra attention at a major gallery. 
{0.SimFirstName} suggests a series of classes with visiting artists, and the local community comes out in droves.
{0.SimFirstName} plays it safe and buys more artwork to replace what was sold. {M0.He}{F0.She} even scores some especially valuable finds!
{0.SimFirstName} uses the technique for several pieces in {M0.his}{F0.her} upcoming show, but invites the student to stand up and receive a round of applause on opening night.
