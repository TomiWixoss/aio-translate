The exec throws a temper tantrum, but no one seems to notice or care. They keep {0.SimFirstName}’s version and play it for the company at a team meeting. {M0.He}{F0.She} stills hears people humming it to themselves as {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves the building.
Well, it turns out to be an okay party. After another round of polite conversation, someone turns on some music and things pick up. {0.SimFirstName}’s friend seems happy.
This pack is a little too good at sniffing out the truth. As eyes start to narrow, {0.SimFirstName} starts to stutter and forgets the few ideas {M0.he}{F0.she} came up with on the way. {M0.He}{F0.She} cuts the intro short and gets on with the bidding. Hopefully {M0.his}{F0.her} employers won’t notice!
{0.SimFirstName} nails it! Why, the gag is even funnier than it was before. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to write that one down before {M0.he}{F0.she} forgets it.
Wow, what great friends {0.SimFirstName} has! EVERYONE was there. Too bad NO ONE laughed. But still, great friends!
Nice! {0.SimFirstName} gets him good! Who’s laughing now, Clownface?
The director agrees and changes the script. {0.SimFirstName}’s jokes get the best laughs, and the MC brings in a few more for kicks. {0.SimFirstName} is only credited as “additional writers,” but hey, {M0.he}{F0.she} was on TV, sort of.
{0.SimFirstName}’s fans rally behind {M0.him}{F0.her}. One fan invites {0.SimFirstName} to play in his basement, and another promises a full-page article in a small zine. Too bad the buzz among club managers isn’t nearly as friendly.
Well, it’s always nice to be nice. Who knows who’s watching? The prodigy thanks {0.SimFirstName} for the tip, but then promises to bury {M0.him}{F0.her} in the audition. Yikes!
Everyone is too Dazed and distracted to notice or care. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} could probably just play the same note continuously for 20 minutes and still go unremarked.
{0.SimFirstName} matches the other comic in grossness, but unfortunately that means {M0.he}{F0.she} fails to stand out. The judges wind up flipping a coin and gives the win to {0.SimFirstName}!
What was {0.SimFirstName} thinking? This is advertising, not the Music Awards. The VP throws a fit and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} rewrite it, using “piddle” in at least 4 places. And that’s just the 15-second cut!
The jingle is worse, but the VP is happy. Happy clients means more work for {0.SimFirstName}, and that’s more important than creative fulfillment, right?
When {0.SimFirstName} returns for {M0.his}{F0.her} second set, the club is closed and no one seems to know where the owner went. Doesn’t look like she plans to come back, either...
Everyone is too Dazed and distracted to notice or care. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} could probably just play the same note continuously for 20 minutes and still go unremarked.
Kudos to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.His}{F0.Her} fingers fly up and down the frets, weaving a tune that blends seamlessly into the bassist’s wild solo. The crowd goes absolutely wild over the unexpected team-up. What a great show!
Nobody blames {0.SimFirstName}. In fact they all look a little relieved. {0.SimFirstName} helps {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to a plate of lukewarm food and calls it a day.
{0.SimFirstName}’s friend hears what {M0.he}{F0.she} passed up to perform at the party, and is very grateful. He pumps everyone up and makes sure {0.SimFirstName} has a great crowd to perform to. It’s one of {M0.his}{F0.her} best shows!
Nice try. The host snatches the mic before {0.SimFirstName} can make a worse mess. {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation is going to take a pretty bad hit over this.
Who knew {0.SimFirstName}’s friend could be so sensitive? He starts shouting insults back, airing a bit of {0.SimFirstName}’s dirty laundry. A few couples leave before the bouncer escorts the friend to the door.
The act just needed a little push! {0.SimFirstName} has really got everyone laughing now, and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend looks happy. At least someone at this party has personality!
A famous celebrity in the crowd couldn’t help but voice their opinion of how terrible {0.SimFirstName}’s act is. Loudly. It isn’t long until everyone in the audience is murmuring.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with the music {0.SimFirstName} has been playing, but now that {M0.he}{F0.she} has accepted the blame, it seems all wrong to the bride. {0.SimFirstName} is fired on the spot.
Well, the good news is, {0.SimFirstName}'s friend is still speaking to {M0.him}{F0.her}. But no one in the audience cracked a smile, and everyone keeps asking, &quot;Oh, was that you?&quot; when {M0.he}{F0.she} asks them about the speech later.
The producer is happy and {0.SimFirstName} gets a pretty decent check, for a vegetable. The ad is completely forgettable and gets pulled early.
Shouting throws {0.SimFirstName}’s rhythm off, and the librarian impressions fall a little flat. But {0.SimFirstName} gets warm applause for trying.
{0.SimFirstName} soon has everyone cracking up and the rough cut they put together looks great. The ad should be a hit. {0.SimFirstName} just hopes that when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets on stage now, people don’t shout, “Hey, it’s the cauliflower!”
The host is not happy, but the show must go on-and at least it won’t involve a wardrobe malfunction. The host has the caterers rearrange some large ferns, shielding {0.SimFirstName} from view. And recognition.
Phew! Whatever was happening during rehearsal doesn’t repeat itself during the first performance. The master cellist has lost a little of his luster in {0.SimFirstName}’s eyes, but the concert goes fine.
Oops! {0.SimFirstName} remembers the right line right after the wrong one trips out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. People are laughing-but at {0.SimPronounObjective}, not with {0.SimPronounObjective}.
It works! A crowd starts to gather and clap to the music. One couple even attempts to dance to it. Of course, nobody knows who on earth {0.SimFirstName} is, but hey, they like {M0.his}{F0.her} music!
Well played! After an hour of dabbing the keys with {M0.cotton boxer briefs}{F0.a jewelry cloth}, the piano sounds as good as new. It took a little work, but {0.SimFirstName} is able to avoid a costly repair.
{0.SimFirstName} made the right call! The kid crams for the heist in one afternoon, over ten cups of coffee, then pulls a successful job—and even swings the getaway car past a diner to grab {0.SimFirstName} a Reuben!
Hey, that old lady could be somebody's grandma! {0.SimFirstName} decides to show an elder a little respect. Anybody got a problem with that?
Ah. It appears a dog walker has left {0.SimFirstName}... holding the bag. That is unfortunate!
Looks like {0.SimFirstName} bagged a sweet deal. Cold! Hard! Cash!
Give the Raise
Test Him First
The armored car plows right through {0.SimFirstName}'s road block and keeps going, leaving behind nothing but dark, curving skid marks, reminiscent of so many abstract paint trails.
The armored car is run off the road and the driver easily gives up the painting. (&quot;Looks like something my kid would make!&quot;) Now this masterpiece can be enjoyed by the highest bidder instead of a bunch of freeloading tourists. Success!
Even a petty thief has standards. {0.SimFirstName} decides it's better to save those bag snatching skills for more promising briefcases and fancy purses.
Drill Safe
Interrogate Manager
{0.SimFirstName}'s crew is a well-oiled machine. The veteran crooks make up for Sammy's absence and pull a flawless job!
{0.SimFirstName}'s crew is good, but you never know what can happen when you make last second changes to the plan. Without Sammy on lookout, the cops interrupt the crew mid-heist and they barely escape.
Surprise Attack!
Sneak On By
Hey, look, {0.SimFirstName} has stumbled across some photos of the trash talker riding a pony, while dressed as a fox—with a princess tiara and fairy wings. Enjoy the new meme, internet!
{0.SimFirstName} can't break through the encryption. Argh! Whoever heard of a troll that actually knows what he's talking about? {0.SimFirstName} shouldn't have wasted the time.

Post Manifesto
After some intense interrogation, the codes are surrendered to {0.SimFirstName}. Who knew that bank managers were so ticklish? Time to open that vault!
At the first threat of violence, the bank manager faints right to the floor. Really, bank manager?? There's no way for {0.SimFirstName} to get the codes in time now.
{0.SimFirstName} should have done a little more research! {M0.He}{F0.She} accidentally leaves the museum with a fingerpainting made by the curator's kid!
{0.SimFirstName} sneaks into the museum during a shift change,  exchanging the famous work with a kindergarten painting from a kid down the block. No one notices!
{0.SimFirstName} to Triangle: &quot;Who sent you?&quot; Triangle to {0.SimFirstName}: &quot;What is the sound of one hand hacking?&quot; Gasp! It's the mentor The Oracle has been waiting for! {0.SimFirstName} joins forces with Triangle on the ultimate mission: toppling the entire Internet!
The Oracle receives an automated response from Triangle Life Insurance. It was spam. Sad face.
Leaving a trail of sparks dancing across the blacktop, {0.SimFirstName} expertly manuevers the crippled vehicle back to the safehouse at full speed.
Now {0.SimFirstName} has a flat tire and a bent axle. The crew is forced to abandon the vehicle (and some of the loot) to continue the getaway on foot.
Aw! Look at that big old guard, sleeping like a baby. {0.SimFirstName} caught him by surprise and he never had a chance. Someone should tell that guard that being &quot;The Muscle&quot; isn't just about muscle!
Huh. Guess that nerve pinch move only works on TV. Something for {0.SimFirstName} to think about while {M0.he}{F0.she} runs away from the enraged guard!
Let It Slide

{0.SimFirstName} remains cool and neutral, like a bowl of plain yogurt, making no new enemies—or friends. Nothing is settled in the great mask debate.

Respond to Triangle
Just Leave It
Help the Kitten
{0.SimFirstName} might be in a little trouble with the boss, but {M0.he}{F0.she} never does a job on the fly. {M0.He}{F0.She} only does a fly job. That reputation and record of success takes careful planning.
Turns out the old lady didn't get into her 80s without some serious survival skills. With her walker and surprising strength she knocks {0.SimFirstName} into the street in front of the other thugs. Bye bye, street cred!
{0.SimFirstName} convinces the old woman to pay to have the shoes shined and re-scaled. And now the other thugs know that NOBODY gets a free pass from {0.SimFirstName}!
Try for Wallet
Keep Walking
Shut It Down
Attempt a Hot Fix

Pull a 180
Oh, no! {0.SimFirstName} left {M0.his}{F0.her} cell phone on full volume! Not only has {M0.he}{F0.she} given away {M0.his}{F0.her} position, but now the guard is making fun of {M0.his}{F0.her} ringtone.
Being &quot;The Muscle&quot; isn't just about muscle--{0.SimFirstName} knows that. With surprising skill, {M0.he}{F0.she} slips stealthily by the guard to the target entrance. Looks like this job will go off without a hitch!

So Joe's locked up? Let that crook's mother post bail. {0.SimFirstName} has better uses for that money, like making one of those thrones out of stacks of cash like you see in the music videos.
Keep a Low Profile
Go For It
They don’t call {0.SimFirstName} a master blender for nothing. Expertly pairing the mystery bean’s qualities with a dashingly bold, dark-chocolate rainforest roast, {0.SimFirstName} blends up the ultimate crowd pleaser, which {M0.he}{F0.she} titles “{0.SimFirstName} Surprise”. No one asks who {0.SimFirstName} is, but {M0.he}{F0.she}’s almost sure {M0.his}{F0.her} manager knows.
{0.SimFirstName} scrubs and scrapes uselessly at the carafe. The second {M0.his}{F0.her} manager goes on break, the carafe goes in the trash. Of course the manager finds it later and decides that {0.SimFirstName} can pull extra trash duty since that’s {M0.his}{F0.her} preferred method of cleaning up.
Daringly pairing the mystery bean’s sweet-and-sour aromas with a dashingly bold, dark-chocolate rainforest roast, {0.SimFirstName} concocts a truly original blend {M0.he}{F0.she} names “{0.SimFirstName} Surprise”. It tastes as bad as it sounds. Customers demand a refund. Nobody asks who {0.SimFirstName} is, but unfortunately, {M0.his}{F0.her} manager knows.
{0.SimFirstName} scrubs and scrapes, hands pruning in water so tepid the bacteria must consider it a pool party. After 60 stomach-turning minutes, {M0.he}{F0.she} finally sees {M0.his}{F0.her} own green face shining forth from the carafe. {M0.His}{F0.Her} manager would be very impressed, if he hadn’t left a while back.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. {0.SimFirstName} brews up some joe from the mystery bean, labels it “Midnight Magic” and slaps an Organic! sticker on the sign. Customer after customer orders a cup, raving about it being “so unique” and “almost spicy.” When {M0.his}{F0.her} manager comes back from his break, he tastes it, erases the sign and scribbles “Decaf.” 
{0.SimFirstName} decides it’s best to give the man what he ordered. {M0.He}{F0.She} carefully measures, froths, dollops and serves, presenting the boss with a perfect classic latte. The boss nods and smiles his first smile, prompting a thumbs-up from {0.SimFirstName}’s manager.
