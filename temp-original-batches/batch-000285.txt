A collection of Butterflies and Moths found at various locations around Gibbi Point.
Gibbi Point Butterflies &amp; Moths
&lt;i&gt;In Wanderwood Wilds, by the water's embrace, owl eyes hide in a leafy place.\n\nA tower stands guard near where this mystery lies. Find it before the daylight dies.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;At a festival where young and old convene, miss butterfly Jorja joins the scene.\n\nIn purple grace, where meals abound, a butterfly who goes where friends are found.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Crystal Valley, by the Electric Lagoon, catch a Jellyfish to summon a butterfly or two.\n\nPlace in World to make them appear, and then watch as Jelly Butterflies flutter near.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Crystal Valley and Jellyfish Junction, at sun's fall, a Goliath of moths heeds night’s call.\n\nNightly when most Sims dream, seek this moth where the city lights gleam.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Wanderwood Wilds' path near the waterfall’s gleam, a butterfly's wings shimmer, nearly unseen.\n\nSeek in the day's gentle light, amidst the foliage, a translucent sight.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Crystal Valley, where treasures unfold, miss Dina floats like sun and gold.\n\nSpotted in the midday gleam, find this beauty by the miner's stream.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;On Jellyfish Junction shores, when the moon is new, a moth gathers for a bioluminescent view.\n\nWith death’s embrace and the Reaper’s grace, find this moth in its haunting space.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In the dark of night on Crystal Valley's land, a Cryptid Moth lurks. The mystery expands.\n\nIn the foliage near the Plumbird’s lair, solve the quest to find it there.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Crafted in magic, to life it springs, a butterfly of paper spreads its wings.\n\nCollect all others to see it thrive, placed in a habitat to come alive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;At the fire festival’s heart, a mysterious sphinx plays its part.\n\nNear the flame, in wilderness' domain, discover this moth where stories reign.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Wanderwood Wilds where the Rangers reside, a Birdwing's fluttering is hard to hide.\n\nSearch in bushes, and flowers too, near the station, a black, yellow, teal hue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Begin with Toshie in Jellyfish Junction’s heart. The Melody of the Geyser is where you start.\n\nInvestigate and return, then Boulder Strike. Watch the Red Admiral take its flight.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Along Jellyfish Junction's shores in glimmering light, a pirate's lover takes her flight.\n\nSpotted daily, in lilac attire, she is a princess whose legend never tires.&lt;/i&gt;
Despite this familiar being the mysterious and silent type you may still catch yourself whispering to them, “Do that voodoo that you do!”
This interesting creature is an unexpected entity that defies normal boundaries and demands a closer inspection. Its true nature is unknown.
The Veild is a Voidcritter deep with the knowledge of countless galaxies across space and time. No one really knows the true motivation of this critter, but that didn’t stop one well known kids TV show from almost featuring the Veild as a main character.
A classic Spellcaster companion, bats have commonly been closely associated to magic users since the times of ancients.
The harbingers of prophecy and, some say, bad luck. Ravens are an ancient creature that remain steadfast alongside their favorite Spellcasters.
The Phoenix is intimately familiar with the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. From the ashes they arise and into the ashes they fall. So has it always been.
