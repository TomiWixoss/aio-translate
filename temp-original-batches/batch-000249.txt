Mega Column (Basic)
Just because you decorate your house in a simple arts and crafts style doesn’t mean you can’t add a little class to the place. A few marble columns will make people say “Whoa. Where’d all this class come from?” You gotta get yourself some marble columns!
Mega Column (Budget DeLite)

Mega Column (Deluxe)
Are you prepared to start collecting columns with the big boys? Ready to take that next step? You will NEVER find another column that is both as straight and as round as this one. We know because we asked robots to design it. The Deluxe Mega Column: because you are seriously not messing around anymore.
