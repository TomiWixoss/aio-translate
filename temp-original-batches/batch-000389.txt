Sugar Skull Display Case
When each spot in this case contains a unique sugar skull, the ability to &quot;Honor the Dead&quot; will unlock. This interaction causes colorful smoke to spill forth, and your Sim will commune with their inner Catrina to allow for enhanced interactions with the Grim Reaper.\n\nSugar skulls are received as gifts from other Sims who are celebrating the Day of the Dead. They can only be acquired during the Day of the Dead Challenge.
