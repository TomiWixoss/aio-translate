Red lights flash and klaxons blare as the ship prepares to obliterate itself. Then everything goes calm, and with a small &quot;ping&quot; an error message appears. Apparently the drivers on the ship's Self Destruct need to be updated. Carefully clicking “Not Now,” {0.SimFirstName} vows to run a full system update as soon as {M0.he}{F0.she}'s safely back home.
{0.SimFirstName} recalls a nifty trick. Pursing {M0.his}{F0.her} lips, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets out a shrill alien mating cry. The egomaniac pilot turns 1 eye on the horizon and 1 on his mirror, but his 3rd eye spots {0.SimPronounObjective} coming! The alien dodges {0.SimFirstName}’s fire as the clock runs out. Telling {0.SimPronounObjective} to focus on upgrades, not stunts, the alien leaves {0.SimFirstName} to skulk home.
Luckily the police captain seems to be into {0.SimFirstName}. The cop believes {0.SimFirstName}'s story and takes the contraband without further questioning. The captain also rewards {0.SimFirstName} with a small stack of cash and a personal comm number--just in case {0.SimFirstName} needs anything. *Wink!*
{0.SimFirstName} fires {F0.her}{M0.his} ship's blasters, which bounce harmlessly off the surface of the creature. Oops. The creature slams into the ship, sending it careening. {0.SimFirstName} limps away back to home, with some bruises...
Sunset Valley, we have a problem! Like a poor-man's Icarus, {0.SimFirstName} flew too close to the moon, and has slingshot {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket up to perilous reentry speeds! {F0.She}{M0.He} should come plummeting home any minute now.
{0.SimFirstName} is attempting to take one small step, but for unknown reasons is unable to take that step. Stomping, waving {M0.his}{F0.her} arms, and shouting at the sky, though standard protocol, are proving ineffectual. It appears a small rock is in the way! {0.SimFirstName} cannot reach the surface.
After entering the wrong code too many times, {M0.he's}{F0.she's} locked out. {0.SimFirstName} sulks, complaining about enemy agents and hidden messages being broadcast in {M0.his}{F0.her} TV. But wait - those things aren't real! The Space Madness finally seems to be passing! {0.SimFirstName} realizes how irrational {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been and heads for home before another attack hits.
This space walk is going to be amazing! {0.SimFirstName} puts on {M0.his}{F0.her} suit - along with its auxiliary air tank. After a few minutes of breathing clean air, {M0.he}{F0.she} regains {M0.his}{F0.her} sanity and realizes what happened. {M0.He}{F0.She} decides to stay in the suit and just head for home. Luckily {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't do anything too crazy!
As {0.SimFirstName} blasts off home, {M0.he}{F0.she} assures {M0.himself}{F0.herself} that it was probably for the best. Racing can be dangerous without upgraded gear … though {M0.he}{F0.she} could definitely use that prize money.
{0.SimFirstName} gets a lock on Red Tooth and fires, but the shot glances limply off the TS-555. Without better cannons, the most {M0.he}{F0.she} can hope to do to Red Tooth is irritate him. Snarling, Red Tooth rams {0.SimFirstName} off the track, damaging part of {M0.his}{F0.her} left wing. It’s gonna be a rough flight back.
The guard seizes {0.SimFirstName} and injects {0.SimPronounObjective} anyway. When {0.SimFirstName} wakes up, {M0.he}{F0.she} is on the asphalt next to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound is locked, and the only response to {M0.his}{F0.her} knocks is a lot of barking. Looks like it’s time to pack this mission in.
{0.SimFirstName} knows exactly what to toss through that window: {M0.his}{F0.her} helmet!! The window is jarred from its frame but the pressure change starts sucking everything out of the cabin! Luckily a replacement window gets wedged into the hole and seals it. The ship automatically cycles in the reserve air and {0.SimFirstName}'s head finally clears. Better get home for repairs!
Rookie mistake! Without upgraded thrusters, {0.SimFirstName}’s ship can’t be pushed to those kinds of limits. Suddenly {M0.his}{F0.her} ship rattles violently and all systems sputter out! Spinning off the track, {M0.he}{F0.she} smashes into an asteroid. Luckily, the damage seems fixable, but it’ll be rough getting home.
{0.SimFirstName} points out {M0.he}{F0.she} could already be in trouble for alien-napping and stays {M0.his}{F0.her} course, assuming the little orange guy won’t have the guts to ask twice. Sure enough, the creature stays silent. Once they land, it quietly uncuffs {0.SimPronounObjective}, but smashes a panel angrily on its way out. Might be a rough flight home…
{0.SimFirstName} gathers up some random garbage and debris and ejects it out into space. Now the area is littered with empty bottles and cellophane wrappers. That'll throw 'em off the scent. Quite pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} smarts and ingenuity, {0.SimFirstName} heads home.
{0.SimFirstName} has just enough fuel to safely make it back home. Along the way, {M0.his}{F0.her} head starts clearing and the Space Madness starts lifting a bit. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks back on the past several hours…this was a really, really strange trip.
The wiring in this ship is almost definitely sending messages to the government. But now that it's all pulled out, the ship won't run! Oops. Still better than letting the men in trench coats start reading {M0.his}{F0.her} thoughts. {0.SimFirstName} is alone with {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness as {M0.he}{F0.she} waits for someone to tow {0.SimPronounObjective} back home...
Phew! The cops believe {0.SimFirstName} and take {M0.his}{F0.her} little orange buddy home. Now {0.SimFirstName} can head home {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and wonder how a simple trip to the Flea Market got so out of control!
Every light in {0.SimFirstName}'s cockpit is flashing, and every siren is blaring - the cargo is just too much! {0.SimFirstName} jettisons the extra poundage into space - the trader's going to be furious, but hopefully it helps {0.SimFirstName} make re-entry without any catastrophes...
It takes a while for {0.SimFirstName} to get the alien’s attention, but once {M0.he}{F0.she} does, the alien is quite reasonable about things. This seems to be his species' version of golf? Claiming he didn’t know it would mess up communication, he hands over his space rocks and goes on his way.
If {0.SimFirstName} thought the alien looked merry before, now {F0.she's}{M0.he's} in for the real special. Grinning from pointy green ear to pointy green ear, the creature chortles, catches another asteroid in the phase beam, and hurls it at {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, cracking a tail panel. He's reaching for another as {0.SimFirstName} blasts away at top speed. Hopefully, {M0.he}{F0.she} can still land....
{0.SimFirstName} finally staggers back to the ship, exhausted. Smacking the beast with a makeshift club had only made it angrier, and {0.SimFirstName} wound up leading it on quite a merry chase. {M0.He}{F0.She} finally managed to lose it, but the alien ship part was lost as well. Now to attempt the flight home without it…
Thank goodness {0.SimFirstName} brought that bottle of juice! {M0.He}{F0.She} chugs it down to help with the pain. But a strange thing happens…the juice counteracts {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness, and {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes lucid again! {0.SimFirstName} has discovered the cure for Space Madness! {M0.He}{F0.She} heads home, wondering if there is any way to patent fruit juice!
{0.SimFirstName} doesn't know what happens to people who stick around in situations like this, because those people are all dead. {M0.He'd}{F0.She'd} really prefer not to be one of them, so {M0.he}{F0.she} hops into {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket and blasts off before this turns into a bad horror movie.
One swift kick from {0.SimFirstName}'s moon boot, and the alien flies into the airlock, where it is ejected into deep space. As it floats away, it makes some very rude gestures. Well, that kind of attitude certainly has no place on {0.SimFirstName}'s ship!
Out in the blackness of deep space, {0.SimFirstName}'s body starts reacting to the pressure differential microscopically. The pressure vortex actually equalizes {0.SimFirstName}'s brain waves! The Space Madness is gone! {M0.He's}{F0.She's} clear-headed again and sets a course for home. This time, {M0.he}{F0.she} locks the ship into autopilot, just in case.
While the little creature is looking the other way {0.SimFirstName} reaches for the part, but as soon as {M0.he}{F0.she} touches it, a small, scaly hand grabs {M0.his}{F0.hers}! Slowly, the creature looks back at {0.SimFirstName} and hisses. The other creatures in the camp hiss and draw lethal-looking blades. No choice! {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to make a run for it and fly home without the part!
After breathing from the rescue tank for a few minutes, {0.SimFirstName} feels clearer and less crazy. That was close. And if {M0.he}{F0.she} goes back to breathing regular air, the symptoms will just come back, so {0.SimFirstName} decides to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} trip short and head back home early.
{0.SimFirstName} always has been a good talker, and lies are easier when they contain a smidgen of truth. Explaining about the broken GPS, {M0.he}{F0.she} leads the spider-like creatures toward {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. Sure enough, the screen is still black. Muttering, an alien technician climbs aboard and slams it 3 times. Magic! {0.SimFirstName} enters {M0.his}{F0.her} home coordinates and clears out fast.
&quot;Another trick!&quot; {0.SimFirstName} thinks as the gems glitter and sparkle, tantalizingly close. The alien beings look at each other in confusion. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} not know the value of what is being presented? A buzzer, unmistakingly indicating failure, sounds, and {0.SimFirstName} is zapped abruptly back onto {F0.her}{M0.his} spaceship, no riches to be had.
{0.SimFirstName} turns {M0.his}{F0.her} ship around and hightails it out of there. Maybe it would be better to study the creature some more before attempting to talk to it.
No time to waste! The black hole is already sucking {0.SimFirstName}’s rocketship toward certain destruction. Securing the alien ship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, {M0.he}{F0.she} crosses {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers and pulls. Argh! The force is too strong. The cable snaps and a piece is torn from {0.SimFirstName}’s rocket. {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts {M0.his}{F0.her} engines again and escapes, but landing will be another story...
Armed with a gallon of Chartreuse Charm and some wadded-up toilet paper, {0.SimFirstName} gets to work painting. But after inhaling the fumes for a few minutes a weird thing happens - {M0.he}{F0.she} feels the Space Madness lifting! While in {M0.his}{F0.her} moment of lucidity, {M0.he}{F0.she} charts a course for home and locks in the autopilot!
{0.SimFirstName} is a pro at putting {M0.his}{F0.her} butt into butt-reception areas! {F0.She}{M0.He} sits down without incident, and the crowd goes wild! But they’re not cheering, they’re laughing. The pedestal/chair/{0.SimFirstName} ensemble sinks into the floor just like the other tests! {0.SimFirstName} is swallowed by the machination, dumped unceremoniously into {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket, and blasted home. What a mean trick!
{0.SimFirstName} puts together… something… from a collection of random parts around the station. Unfortunately, the only thing it produces is a sparky surprise and the faint smell of burning. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes and uses the rocket's radio to call for some real help.
{0.SimFirstName} attempts to manually connect the dynotherms, which causes them to explode magnificently. Parts of the engine that were never meant to be exposed to space are now exposed to space. This could potentially cause problems with re-entry…
They'll never catch {0.SimFirstName}! NEVER!! {M0.He}{F0.She}'ll double back home while they're searching the cosmos. With a clever grin, {0.SimFirstName} sets an orbit around a planet that is completely not {M0.his}{F0.her} homeworld. Hopefully a passing ship will give {0.SimPronounObjective} a tow eventually...
After an hour of searching, {0.SimFirstName} lamely offers up a couple of twigs. The creature shakes his head. “You have failed the trial. Help you, I will not.” The only option now is to fire up the engines and go for full burn to clear the muck. There’s no telling what damage that could do to the ship, though…
{0.SimFirstName} engages Safe Mode and the dynotherms immediately explode out of the ship. That hardly seems safe at all! However, it does clear the error message and that's what's important. Unfortunately, landing with a minor engine breach and no dynotherms is insanely dangerous...
{0.SimFirstName} successfully punches out the window with an old wrench, but the pressure change starts sucking everything out of the cabin! Luckily a replacement window gets wedged into the hole and seals it. Wow! The ship automatically cycles in the reserve air and {0.SimFirstName}'s head finally clears. Better get home for repairs!
There is just enough light left for {0.SimFirstName} to make out a large camp, but whoever was staying here appears to have left for safer shelter. Turning toward the sound of a deep growl, {M0.he}{F0.she} spies a pack of monstrous beasts sniffing the ground not far away. This planet isn’t safe. {0.SimFirstName} decides to attempt the flight home without the replacement part.
Bad news! The probe can't traverse the lunar landscape! Also, it isn't gathering any data! Additionally, it may actually be a space-espresso machine and not a probe at all! Looks like {0.SimFirstName} is going home empty-handed.
