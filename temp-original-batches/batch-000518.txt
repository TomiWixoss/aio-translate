Simplicity Nightstand
Nightstands have two functions: hold up a lamp, and store stuff. This does both.
Naught-ical Nightstand
Keeping secrets isn’t easy at sea, but Princess Cordelia loved a challenge! She fashioned this innocent-looking nightstand to conceal her naughtiest secrets, as well as several beautiful unmentionable trifles. (Despite that quality they were actually mentioned by her pirate boyfriends quite often.)
Dreamland Nightstand
The perfect spot for a bedtime reading lamp, this darling nightstand also adds storage for flashlights and other secret treasures. Two sliding drawers open and close softly, so children won’t awaken their parents when setting traps for the tooth fairy.
Embark Nightstand
Salvaged from the wreckage of the Titanic’s lesser-known sister ship, Ginormous, hundreds of sea-hardened trunks were transformed into our Embark nightstands collection, with glass protection added against less-historic dents.
Weathered Wonder Night Table
A perfect companion to the Weathered Wonder Dresser, this two-drawer nightstand boasts the signature, hand-distressed accents of our most popular collection. But don’t let its stoic exterior fool you. Its discreet, yet cavernous, drawers have a secret faux-floor, designed to conceal the most intimate bedside essentials.
The Ultimate
The Ultimate is another celebration of the beauty and utility of the flat surface brought to you by Reclamation Homeware. It is superior over The Penultimate nightstand in that it has an additional drawer.
The Penultimate
The most noble of all the simple machines is obviously the humble surface. Simply by the nature of being flat it gives us so much, has allowed us to evolve from brutal cave clans into the magnificent society we enjoy today. Impossible to improve upon (except for The Ultimate). From Reclamation Homeware.
