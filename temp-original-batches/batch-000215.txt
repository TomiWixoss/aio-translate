Salvage Mission
As the rocket sinks another inch into the swamp, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly spies a funny little green man hobbling over to {M0.him}{F0.her}. Amazingly, the creature speaks perfect Simlish! “Help you, I can,” he rasps. Well, almost perfect Simlish. He offers to raise {0.SimFirstName}’s ship from the swamp if {M0.he}{F0.she} can pass certain trials. {0.SimFirstName} agrees.
The Green Man
That’s not what happened! A chrono-shock chrono-rocks the spaceship, sending it home in tatters!
{0.SimFirstName} is off on another amazing adventure in space! Or, {M0.he}{F0.she} would be if {M0.his}{F0.her} ship were actually moving, which it is not. An error message on the main control screen informs {0.SimPronounObjective} that the ship's dynotherm drivers need to be updated.
The asteroid shatters into fragments which burn up harmlessly into the atmosphere. {0.SimFirstName} is able to grab some fragments that blasted loose.
To the east, a jagged series of rocks stabs upward toward the alien sky. It looks like a cross between a mountain range and a pile of shrapnel. {0.SimFirstName} can see a lone curl of smoke rising from one of the peaks. To the west, the valley looks much easier to traverse but there are no obvious signs of life.
{0.SimFirstName} quietly follows the creature. {F0.She}{M0.He} notices that the alien changes colors in a certain pattern, seemingly as a way to communicate. Eventually, the creature flies away.
“Time for the first trial, it is,” rasps the creature, “Pick a number between one and ten.” “Four,” says {0.SimFirstName}. “Well done. Now, the second trial…” Hey, this is easy! The creature continues, “Make me some lunch, you will.” {0.SimFirstName} could search in the surrounding jungle, or there might be some kind of fish in the swamp?
The ship's blasters don't even make a dent on the rock. {0.SimFirstName} has no choice but to block the asteroid with the ship!
{0.SimFirstName} is almost out the door when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears a chorus of tiny, beseeching voices. Surely it couldn't hurt to hear one or two prayers, right? When else will {0.SimFirstName} get the chance?
{0.SimFirstName} tries to shove all the stuff into the cargo bay, but they hear a terrible CRUNCH - the alien's terrarium just shattered. Oops. Since he has nowhere to put his prized &quot;pet,&quot; he gives it to {0.SimFirstName} as payment for the ride. &quot;His name is Bandit,&quot; says the alien.
Yes! Those amazing ion cannons blast off the pastry bunny’s arm. A new arm starts to regenerate, but the bunny seems to have learned its lesson and floats off into space.
Well, if smiting is what the people want....{0.SimFirstName} starts squashing some of the offenders with {M0.his}{F0.her} thumb or brushing them into the trash. But now all of the aliens are terrified of {0.SimPronounObjective}! {0.SimFirstName}'s losing their goodwill!
Sure enough, the map leads {0.SimFirstName} to a charred-looking planet with a lone tree growing from a cliff. At first glance the place seems abandoned, but then {M0.he}{F0.she} notices the opening to a small tunnel beneath the tree. Go in?
{0.SimFirstName} sends a message of peace to the creature, who responds by flashing bright red. Suddenly, a much bigger plumbob creature appears around the side of the asteroid, looking quite angry. Does {0.SimFirstName} attempt to fight the creature, or flee?
An asteroid is rocketing towards the planet! What is {0.SimFirstName} going to do?!
After double-checking Fitz’s photo in the {M0.men’s room}{F0.ladies’ room}, {0.SimFirstName} asks the alien about the leash. Flustered, the alien begins to swell and turn yellow, but insists it came from a solar cat they had recently captured. Just then, {0.SimFirstName} hears a whimper from beneath the desk. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} make a grab for the animal or wait for an explanation?
{0.SimFirstName} is soaring through the outer reaches of space when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices an insanely bright—something—glowing below {0.SimPronounObjective}. As {M0.he}{F0.she} swings in closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} hears engines revving and realizes: it’s an interstellar race track! There’s a prize for the winner, but these contestants are no joke. {0.SimFirstName} better be sure {M0.his}{F0.her} ship is up to it. Join the race?
&quot;What's wrong with this civilization!?&quot; {0.SimFirstName} yells. {M0.He}{F0.She} gives the aliens a piece of {M0.his}{F0.her} mind and then walks off in a huff. Despite all the nice things {M0.he}{F0.she} did for them, it looks like {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll be remembered as a despot. As {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship heads for home, the alien historians begin writing of these dark, troubled times.
Stupid ship! Stupid air! Why won't this spaceship window OPEN?! It must be a conspiracy... Well {0.SimFirstName} isn't going to let them get {M0.him}{F0.her} that easily. It'll all be okay if {M0.he}{F0.she} can just get this window open!!
The instant {0.SimFirstName} opens the ship door, the animals swarm {0.SimPronounObjective}! Rethinking {M0.his}{F0.her} approach, {M0.he}{F0.she} opens a portal near the rocket’s tip and tosses out a juicy filet mignon, deftly seasoned with tranquilizers. The biggest beast seizes it, swallows it and promptly keels over. With a little help from {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty grappler, {0.SimFirstName} has the perfect alien specimen!
No luck! {0.SimFirstName} gives the Cosmic Relief fighter a good chase, but it eventually disables one of {M0.his}{F0.her} engines and {M0.he}{F0.she} is forced to return Fitz in the PoochPod they send over. {0.SimFirstName} will have to watch the black market for him—assuming {M0.his}{F0.her} remaining engine can get {0.SimPronounObjective} home.
It isn’t easy to get the alien’s attention—until {0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ion cannons to blast some rocks from his stash. Spooked, the alien jets away in his flying saucer, squealing at the top of its lung-thingies. The interference stops, and {0.SimFirstName} gets some free space rocks for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble!
{0.SimFirstName} is just about to beat {M0.his}{F0.her} personal best time around planet Daiscot when a Comm Alert breaks {M0.his}{F0.her} concentration. It’s Dispatch, requesting assistance with a civil dispute on Hiattooine. Itching for a change of scene, {0.SimFirstName} agrees to the mission and blasts over to see what’s what.
What's that up ahead? {0.SimFirstName} cruises over for a closer look and sees a hulking old ship. It's flying a flag with a spacecash symbol, which is the intergalactic symbol for commerce. It's a trader ship that wants to do business. {0.SimFirstName} begins the docking procedure.
Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} botches {M0.his}{F0.her} attempt at diplomacy again, and a skirmish ensues, {0.SimFirstName} the valiant winner. Avoiding the time-edge this time around, {0.SimFirstName} returns home a hero.
{0.SimFirstName} is off to an excellent start! Rounding the 105th bend, {M0.he}{F0.she} reassesses {M0.his}{F0.her} position in the pack. The dog girl is giving {0.SimPronounObjective} a run for {M0.his}{F0.her} money, and Red Tooth isn’t far behind. Should {0.SimFirstName} rattle Dog Girl’s confidence by stepping on it, or hang back and keep pace until the final laps?
Dog Girl must not have any greyhound in her. {0.SimFirstName} easily keeps pace and manages to eke past her in the final lap to pull off the win! Prize money in hand, {M0.he}{F0.she} hightails it out of there, careful to ditch any disgruntled losers before heading home.
{0.SimFirstName} picks up a piece of metal pipe and shouts, “Anybody there?” The rattling stops. Silence. {M0.He}{F0.She} calls again. Again there’s no response. Whatever’s in there doesn’t want to be found. {0.SimFirstName} has two choices: {M0.he}{F0.she} can brace the door shut, or go in swinging.
{0.SimFirstName} calls out. No answer. The only sound is a soft dripping. {M0.He}{F0.She} treads quietly into the tunnel—but suddenly everything goes black. {M0.He}{F0.She} whirls, flipping on {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty headlamp. Eyes glow in the narrow beam—not two, but hundreds. {0.SimFirstName} can try to talk {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of this, or run like crazy.
{0.SimFirstName} is escorted down a long hallway by a grumpy-looking guard. He shoves {0.SimFirstName} into an examination room and explains that {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} need a rabies shot if  {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to get near the animals. Does {0.SimFirstName} agree to the injection?
Well, that didn’t work. {0.SimFirstName} thought {M0.his}{F0.her} story about losing {M0.his}{F0.her} mutt was rather convincing—{M0.he}{F0.she} even mustered a tear—but the alien isn’t letting {0.SimPronounObjective} past the desk. She can search the computer for recent records or take down {M0.his}{F0.her} info. {0.SimFirstName} agrees to the search to buy time.
{0.SimFirstName} studies the aliens closely--they appear to want more water to grow their crops. But {M0.he's}{F0.she's} an angry, jealous deity, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to test them a little.
{0.SimFirstName} retrieves a treasure from the rocket’s storage, dons {F0.her}{M0.his} spacesuit and backs into a space-moonwalk. {F0.She}{M0.He} leaves the treasure where it was found, and returns. What happened just before?
After double-checking Fitz’s photo in the {M0.men’s room}{F0.ladies’ room}, {0.SimFirstName} asks the alien where the red leash came from. Indignant, the alien begins to swell and turn yellow, then presses a button under the desk. A guard appears with a long, shiny needle and seizes {0.SimFirstName}.
Without the super ion cannons, the blasts bounce right off of the bunny! The angry bunny turns toward {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, but luckily {M0.he}{F0.she} gets away!
{0.SimFirstName} studies the aliens closely - they appear to want more water to grow their crops. The loving, benevolent thing to do would be to give it to them, right?
Deep in the Evil Cave, {0.SimFirstName} encounters {M0.his}{F0.her} ultimate challenge: Nega-{0.SimFirstName}!! And {0.SimFirstName} has no weapons! Luckily, after explaining the situation, Nega-{0.SimFirstName} agrees to just pretend like {0.SimFirstName} defeated {0.SimPronounObjective} so {0.SimFirstName} can go home. Turns out Nega-{0.SimFirstName} is pretty cool. Now to see if that funny creature can get the ship out of the swamp!
The asteroid smashes into the ship with the force of giant chunk of rock that's been hurtling through space. Luckily, it shatters, but the ship shudders from the impact. It might be rough getting home!
{0.SimFirstName} dives into the ship and snaps the door shut seconds before the beast slams into the rocket’s side. Safely inside the ship, {0.SimFirstName} can dress {M0.his}{F0.her} wounds and effect the needed repairs to the port compression coil. It’s time to head home.
{0.SimFirstName} is gliding through the galaxy when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a constellation {M0.he}{F0.she} has never seen before. Double-checking {M0.his}{F0.her} coordinates {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is not where {M0.he}{F0.she} thought at all. What’s more, {M0.his}{F0.her} ship’s GPS (Galactic Positioning System) has gone black. {M0.He}{F0.She} is lost in space!
All of a sudden, {0.SimFirstName} sees a big shadow. {M0.He}{F0.She} quickly looks to see a giant pastry freezer bunny floating by. It looks like it has its eyes focused on another satellite and starts to shoot pink frosting!
&quot;Oh why has thou forsaken us?&quot; cry the aliens. But {0.SimFirstName} just laughs maniacally and continues to be capriciously evil.
{0.SimFirstName} discovers the planet is a giant landfill—a junkyard for broken spacecraft and discarded instruments. {M0.He}{F0.She} has just enough time to collect a few treasures before finding a safe route home.
Rattle—rattle—crash! {0.SimFirstName} is on the way back from the Comet ESON Flea Market when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears banging inside {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship’s cargo hold. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks back through recent salvage efforts … nothing living, certainly. Should {0.SimFirstName} call out, or try to take whatever it is by surprise?
{0.SimFirstName} smacks {M0.his}{F0.her} comm system again. Ever since {M0.he}{F0.she} arrived in space, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been experiencing tons of interference in {M0.his}{F0.her} radio communications. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} about to phone tech support when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees it: the fifth solar flare in the last half hour. That explains it! {0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} better go investigate.
It seems fairly obvious at this point that the crew has completely lost their marbles. {0.SimFirstName} sneaks through the fight and grabs the box of food, hiding it away so they won't waste it. {0.SimFirstName} returns to the rocket and contacts command, who will send a rescue party of trained professionals soon.
Mayday! Mayday! {0.SimFirstName} is cruising through space when {M0.he}{F0.she} receives a distress call from another ship. {M0.He}{F0.She} can’t make out everything the pilot is saying, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does have a clear reading on its location. {M0.He}{F0.She} sets a course to save them.
{0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door, shouting. Something small and orange scampers behind a crate. Scanning the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees that a display for a taxidermied alien {M0.he}{F0.she} found is empty! “Don’t hurt me!” a tiny voice cries. Four eyes peek from behind the crate. {0.SimFirstName} lowers the pipe.
The aliens are pushing some pebbles around and desperately trying to start a farm on a large pile of mold. {0.SimFirstName} can only think of two kinds of deities: the loving, benevolent kind and the angry, jealous kind.
Luckily the police captain seems to be into {0.SimFirstName}. With a dash of charm and some crafty fast-talk, {0.SimFirstName} distracts the cop from performing a thorough search, and the police are gone in no time. Now {0.SimFirstName} just has to find {M0.his}{F0.her} alien friend!
{0.SimFirstName} cruises around picking up all the space junk {M0.he}{F0.she} can find. As it turns out, there is a LOT of junk up here, and the cabin is quickly too full to move in, so {0.SimFirstName} heads home. As {M0.he}{F0.she} re-enters the atmosphere, the Space Madness wears off. &quot;Where did all this junk come from?&quot; {0.SimFirstName} wonders.
Eh, {0.SimFirstName} has had {M0.his}{F0.her} fun. And these aliens have learned a valuable lesson about something...probably. {0.SimFirstName} returns to the ship, leaving the tiny civilization to its own devices until the next &quot;supreme being&quot; makes a rest stop.
{0.SimFirstName} is filling up on rocket fuel when an alien spacecraft pulls up to the pump next to {0.SimPronounObjective}. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't think much of it until {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the alien loading crates onto {M0.his}{F0.her} ship! “The space police are after me!” the alien shouts. “Hide this stuff! I promise I'll make it worth it!”
They want water? {0.SimFirstName} will give them water - {M0.he}{F0.she} fills a bucket full of water and dumps it all over their colony so that it floods their fields. Power is fun, huh, {0.SimFirstName}? What's next?
{0.SimFirstName} makes an admirable attempt to communicate {M0.his}{F0.her} situation through a series of wild hand gestures and earnest facial expressions. The creature mumbles something in a bizarre language and hands over the part! {0.SimFirstName} can return home! ({M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} never know it, but the alien said {M0.he}{F0.she} reminded it of {M0.an uncle}{F0.an aunt} it had back on Grzypllflotz.)
Yeehaw! Nothing like a wide-eyed kid to make {0.SimFirstName} feel like a hero. Kicking {M0.his}{F0.her} ship into hyperwarp, {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts loops around Planet Toomootoo—until suddenly lights appear in the distance. Space cops! {0.SimFirstName} could pull over and try to explain, or try to outrun them.
Good thing {0.SimFirstName} invested in those trusty Ion Cannons. With a few well-placed blasts, the Cosmic Relief fighter is completely disabled. Fitzy-Poo, it's time to head home.
The aliens give thanks, but they're a little miffed. What kind of deity would let {M0.his}{F0.her} people suffer that way? They lose faith. Soon, the prayers stop and the tiny civilization just ignores {0.SimFirstName} entirely. During the long flight home {M0.he}{F0.she} can reflect on the ramifications of power.
Grasping the pipe tighter, {0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door and swings wildly. Just then, something soft and squishy thumps onto {M0.his}{F0.her} back and a tentacle threads around {M0.his}{F0.her} neck. “Don’t move!” a small voice whispers. Everything goes black. {0.SimFirstName} faints, which is technically moving.
Error - Error!  !rorrE -rorrE --  After a perilous journey to the deepest, darkest, edges of space and time, {0.SimFirstName} has ricocheted off of the edge of TIME ITSELF, and is now retracing {F0.her}{M0.his} sojourn in reverse! The rocket is backing into a debris field; what happened here?
As {0.SimFirstName} draws closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that it's an alien spacecraft piloted by a 3-eyed, 16-tentacled alien, who is grinning too much to be in real distress. Claiming to be the best starfighter in the universe, the alien challenges {M0.him}{F0.her} to a duel and offers a substantial reward. Does {0.SimFirstName} accept?
Once in orbit, {0.SimFirstName} gets an odd message from the International Sims Space Station. It's badly garbled and makes little sense. {0.SimFirstName} decides to fly over and check it out.
{0.SimFirstName} knows it’s best not to mess with the law in this quadrant. Besides, someone could have planted the kid just for an excuse to attack. The space cops pick up 4 Eyes and take it home, offering {0.SimFirstName} a small reward for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble.
{0.SimFirstName} can already feel the force of the black hole sucking {M0.his}{F0.her} ship closer. No time to waste! Securing the alien spaceship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket with titanium cable, {M0.he}{F0.she} crosses {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers and engages {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters. Yes! It works. The pilot is so thrilled to have his ship safe, he awards {0.SimFirstName} his most valuable cargo. Score!
Oh no! {0.SimFirstName}'s bad aim has blasted off part of the satellite! Surely everyone's data plan is going to blow up, and OMG, those roaming charges! If only {0.SimFirstName} were more focused!
{0.SimFirstName} scans the tank with {M0.his}{F0.her} special micronoscope, and sees the serial number…it's from {M0.his}{F0.her} own ship! Whoa, this is crazy. How did it get outside? 
Each specimen is weirder and more breathtaking than the last. One looks like a preserved alien with gills AND a nose! As {0.SimFirstName}'s putting the jar in {F0.her}{M0.his} pocket, the ship starts violently shaking. Time to go! As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back on {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket, {0.SimFirstName} feels the ship start breaking apart. Some debris hits the thrusters.... Hope the ship makes it home okay.
Diplomacy first, {0.SimFirstName} always says, and this time it actually works! The colonists only have small demands—a tiny raise in wages, the ability to gather and discuss ideas—but they quickly drop the wage increase to reunite with their government. At the Celebration, everyone enjoys free soup and {0.SimFirstName} is rewarded handsomely for {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts.
{0.SimFirstName}'s never seen rocks like this before! As {M0.he}{F0.she}'s shoving rocks into {M0.his}{F0.her} pockets, the ship starts violently shuddering and breaking apart. {0.SimFirstName} makes it back to the rocket, but a piece of debris hits the back fender, damaging it severely. {F0.She}{M0.He}'ll have to hope that it's spaceworthy for the journey home.
Oh hecks no, {0.SimFirstName}'s not getting on that ship. That's how sci-fi/horror movies start! Odds are, there's nothing on there but rogue viruses, hibernating alien monsters, or something even more horrible. {M0.He}{F0.She} gathers a few pipes and widgets from the outside and gets away before anything terrible can happen.
It's so pretty outside! Look! The Northern Lights!! {0.SimFirstName} can't spend the whole space day cooped up inside like this! {M0.He}{F0.She} needs to get out there and enjoy the beautiful weather! {M0.He}{F0.She} ventures toward the air lock and gets ready to go outside and take a nice walk.
&quot;Space madness,&quot; {0.SimFirstName} carefully enunciates into the comm. &quot;You have selected: Self Destruct,&quot; the voice says, &quot;Remotely engaging your ship's self destruct funtion now.&quot;
That tank must have been tampered with!  {M0.He}{F0.She} knew there was something fishy going on.{0.SimFirstName} puts the tank in the air lock and jets it into space. A few minutes later {M0.he}{F0.she} sees an empty air tank float by {M0.his}{F0.her} window. How did that get there? Is someone following {0.SimPronounObjective}? Is it some kind of listening device?
In a surprising reversal of fortune for the space pirates, {0.SimFirstName} blows open their cargo hold with a well-aimed spazerbeam. Looks like there's some decently valuable junk in there too! {0.SimFirstName} quickly collects what {M0.he}{F0.she} can and blasts off for home.
