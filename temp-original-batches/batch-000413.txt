Laughing Stock
Oh no! Getting caught by the teacher is the fastest way to lose face in front of the class.
Good Laugh
Nothing feels better than a good belly laugh.
&quot;So, what's up with being totally not funny?&quot;
Bullied
The worst kind of bully is the one you can't retaliate against! Untouchable star players are the worst.

It feels good to do well but not if it means everyone else is mad.

Green Lit Idea
That was a risky maneuver, but it paid off in the end. It really was a great idea.
Confusing Sequel
Maybe the next one will bring back alienated fans....
Borrowed Outfit
Since it's been said that beauty is pain, this all seems appropriate, in a way.

It's pretty deflating to see one's work marked down to §1.99.
Academic Fame
Brains and brilliance without question! Good job!
Stunning Ballad
Earned some new fans at the expense of the headliners.
