Princess Cordelia’s Single Bed
Whenever Princess Cordelia grew tired of pirate breath, she retreated to the luxurious solitude of a bed such as this. The original bed was bolted down, but we’ve made it easier for landlubbers to transport-though it’s also a trifle easier to steal.
Double Mission Single Bed
Hand-crafted to solid perfection, this Mission-style bed is not only great for sleeping, its broad headboard and footboard are great for keeping books, lamps, lava lamps, dirty clothes and even a few knick-knacks… although they do detract slightly from the design.
Anti-Goblin Bed by Kindermade
This chunky bed frame offers your child great back support, happy dreams, and the comfort of knowing that nothing, really...nothing! Is hiding under the bed. At Kindermade, comfort and safety are always the first things on our minds, at least where our customers are concerned.

The Eminence
It is only when we close our eyes to temporal reality that we can truly unleash the imagination. To craft the perfect bed, we first took a nap. Its design came to us in a dream. Then, we built it—in our sleep. Made from the infinite potential of the subconscious mind. And garbage. The Eminence, by Reclamation Homeware.
Burst of Pride Single Bed
The single version of the Burst of Pride bed, made even cozier knowing it's just for you. Enjoy extra comfy blankets, fluffy pillows, and a space all your own.
Metal Framed Single Bed
The sturdy wrought metal frame keeps this single bed secure. But you know it's squeaky. I mean just look at it! This bed totally creaks when a Sim goes to sit on it. Maybe good for guest bedrooms?

Assembled by robots in our sleep-tech facility, the Gordian Cot marries convenience and style without compromising the discomfort of camping in the wild.

Princess Cordelia's Galleon Bed
Princess Cordelia had a thing for pirates. Throughout her life she dated three of them. Their swashbuckling style carried over into one of her furniture lines, &quot;Subaquatic Farrrrniture.&quot; This bed is fit for a sea captain and looks like it belongs on a galleon!

Discretion Double Bedsystem
Your significant other will totally dig this audrinite-reinforced hyporeactive bed. Unparelleled buoyancy, minimal noise, and zero springboarding! 
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the art dealer's tasks on time, which immediately fractured their business relationship. The dealer accused {0.SimFirstName} of being an undercover cop, and the situation quickly deteriorated from there. At this point, it's best to just walk away...
{0.SimFirstName} felt somewhat stressed during his work for the client; {M0.he}{F0.she} had the distinct impression that {M0.he}{F0.she} was being surveilled... Oh well, the job is done now, and {0.SimFirstName} received {M0.his}{F0.her} expected payment. Just act normal, and everything should be fine.
The client greatly appreciated {0.SimFirstName}'s 'professionalism' in completing the job without attracting undue interest. {0.SimFirstName} isn't the type to ask questions either; {M0.he's}{F0.she's} just happy to have the forgery gone, and some extra cash in {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket.
{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete the full job on time, and the client didn't seem like the type to handle disappointment well. {M0.He}{F0.She} still received a portion of the job's payment... Presumably the money was to assure {M0.his}{F0.her} continued silence. Hopefully if {M0.he}{F0.she} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} head down, any lingering tension will blow over.
Hitting all the right notes, the client is happy with {0.SimName}'s work. The right mix of high fantasy, drama, and just the right amount of fairy-presence.
{0.SimName} and the client are working their magic, crafting and weaving a fantastic new book series. They were incredibly pleased!
{0.SimName} really should have followed the client's notes more closely. After being told there weren't nearly enough fairies, they both agreed not to work together further. 
The editors enjoyed {0.SimName}'s work and gave excellent feedback on where the next chapters could go. With the experience gained from writing for this series, {F0.she}{M0.he} could really see their career spread its wings and take flight. 
They loved {0.SimName}'s work! Their feedback included praises for bringing back fan favorite characters, adding a new twist to old plot lines, and introducing a wholly new, interesting threat to be explored in later books. 
The company thanks {0.SimName} for their work, but feels the plot is too contrived and breaks fan expectations too strongly. They will let {F0.her}{M0.him} know if they want to work together in the future, but this wasn't the right project.
{0.SimFirstName}'s sci-fi landscapes are spot on for what the film's director had in mind. The director let {M0.him}{F0.her} know that {M0.she'd}{F0.he'd} be happy to enlist {0.SimFirstName}'s talents again in the future.
The film's producers are over the moon for the sci-fi landscapes that {0.SimFirstName} envisioned. They not only paid {0.SimPronounObjective} a bonus for {M0.his}{F0.her} swift work, they also promised to insert a small Easter egg in {M0.his}{F0.her} image into the environment in tribute to his contribution!
The sci-fi film's production has been delayed, because {0.SimFirstName} only completed a portion of the goals that {M0.he}{F0.she} was asked to complete. Union rules still mandated that {M0.he}{F0.she} get paid for the portion of work that {M0.he}{F0.she} did complete though.
The dev team was pleased to receive {0.SimFirstName}'s environment concepts, but they still refused to tell {0.SimPronounObjective} the name of the game that {M0.his}{F0.her} work would be used within. {M0.He}{F0.She}'ll just have to stay tuned to see what the team announces!
The studio's art director can't believe the quality of the work that {0.SimFirstName} submitted, and it was all completed so quickly as well! {M0.She}{F0.He} expressed how much {M0.she}{F0.he} wished that {M0.she}{F0.he} could offer {0.SimFirstName} a full time gig, but the studio unfortunately didn't have any headcount available to allow {M0.her}{F0.him} to do so. {M0.She}{F0.He} was able to procure a nice bonus on top of the gig's agreed upon payment though, and {0.SimFirstName} won't say no to that!
The dev team is frustrated that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete the entirety of {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks by the set milestone, causing the studio to miss an important deadline with their publisher. {0.SimFirstName} was lucky to still receive a partial payment for the portion of the work that {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to finish.
{0.SimFirstName}'s environment concepts arrived just in the nick of time, allowing the team's environment artists to have enough time to create something to show in the game's next kick started campaign update.
The indie studio is incredibly relieved to not only receive such high quality environment concepts from {0.SimFirstName}, but to receive them so swiftly! Their environment artists are starting immediately on turning {M0.his}{F0.her} concepts into fully featured backdrops within the studio's upcoming title. As a thanks, they've funneled some extra kick started cash away from backer rewards and into {0.SimFirstName}'s pocket.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the entirety of {M0.his}{F0.her} goals in time, and the indie studio had to apologize to their project's backers for not having anything to show in their campaign update. They attempted to deflect some of the blame to {0.SimFirstName}, but their fans weren't having it.
{0.SimFirstName} completed the job on time, but had to wait for the paranoid client to double check all the files before receiving the payment. Sometimes there are a few weird ones, but {F0.she}{M0.he} figures it's fine as long as the money is paid.
The client became suspicious at how fast {0.SimFirstName} finished the job. It took a bit of convincing, but when the shifty individual finally turned around, they gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a nice bonus. 
&quot;What do you mean you didn't finish? You're one of them aren't you?! I should've known!&quot;\n\n{0.SimFirstName} doesn't know what happened after that, but was pleasantly surprised when {F0.she}{M0.he} still received a bit of pay.
The small business owner still doesn't really know what happened, but accepted the job as done. {F0.She}{M0.He} reported that the clients seemed happy with the results, so {F0.she}{M0.he} doesn't care.
The small business owner had no idea what was what, but accepted the job as done. Given the early delivery, {F0.she}{M0.he} even gave {0.SimFirstName} a little bonus on top!
Well, it seems {0.SimFirstName} doesn't know encryption either. Either that, or {F0.she}{M0.he} underestimated the amount of work. Either way, the small business owner was pretty upset. It's a good thing they don't seem to know how to file a formal complaint, so {0.SimFirstName} still received a portion of the pay.
The client was obviously relieved when the encrypted files were delivered on time. Not one to wait for an emotional breakdown, {0.SimFirstName} quickly accepted the pay and broke contact.
The client was shocked when the job was done ahead of schedule. Immensely grateful, {F0.she}{M0.he} thanked {0.SimFirstName} with a little bonus!
{0.SimFirstName} failed to encrypt all of the files in time. This seemed to be the last straw for the client, who completely broke down. They said something about &quot;not paying the full amount&quot; before passing out. Not a great job, but at least a little money was earned.
The client accepted the encrypted files and pestered {0.SimFirstName} about whether {F0.she}{M0.he} made copies and are hiding them somewhere. It took a while, but {F0.she}{M0.he} managed to convince them that {F0.she}{M0.he} did not.
The client was very impressed at how fast {0.SimFirstName} was able to deliver the encrypted files. The individual, who tried their best to remain as mysterious as possible, paid a bit extra to show their appreciation.
&quot;You better not be using my data for nefarious purposes...&quot;\n\nIt seems trust isn't the only thing that {0.SimFirstName} lost when {F0.she}{M0.he} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} also lost most of the pay. A little is better than none at all, at least.
The studio clearly underestimated the amount of work that goes into even making text-based games. Still, {0.SimFirstName} finished the project on time, and even enjoyed {F0.herself}{M0.himself} along the way.
The art was so gorgeous, even {0.SimFirstName} was starting to fall in love. {F0.She}{M0.He} ended up so driven to complete the game, that {F0.she}{M0.he} finished it ahead of schedule. The art studio loved that; they promised to work with {F0.her}{M0.him} again soon, and gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a lofty bonus.
The deadline arrived, and nobody is happy. At least all of the concept art and assets can be salvaged for other projects. Based on this alone, the art studio still gave a small amount of pay to {0.SimFirstName} for the time spent.
Either the mechanics were too complex, or the design wasn't clear enough. {0.SimFirstName} was able to finish on time, but the game just isn't fun. It's not {F0.her}{M0.his} business to tell the client that, though. Just take the paycheck and move on!
The gimmicky mechanics were actually very simple to make. Delivering the game ahead of schedule netted {0.SimFirstName} some extra pay, which is great because the game is not original at all and will probably not do very well. Oh well!
{0.SimFirstName} tried to explain that there was no way to work the weird mechanics into the level design, but the client wasn't having it. They claimed that {F0.she}{M0.he} just didn't understand, but it's not {F0.her}{M0.his} fault -- the design is just too ahead of their time.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} was still paid, at least. It's a fraction of the contract pay, but it's something.
It was tough, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to finish on time. Despite the initial impressions, the pay was good too. The game itself is a problem, though, and {0.SimFirstName} is not expecting great reviews...
The game was actually almost done. It turns out the real reason that developers were leaving the project was because of how demanding the game's creative director is. That wasn't a problem for {0.SimFirstName} though. Freelancers are used to picky and rude clients! Apologetic, the producer made sure that a little extra was added to the final payment!
&quot;Not you too? Does everyone want us to fail?&quot;\n\nTrue to their word, the crowd-funded company did pay {0.SimFirstName} whatever they had left. Unfortunately, without a game to ship and running out of time, what they had was not much at all.
It's a fun game with friends for sure. The company was pleased with the end product and invited {0.SimFirstName} to play it with them. Unfortunately, {F0.she}{M0.he} couldn't keep up with the banter and felt a bit left out.
The company actually had a few games they had planned to release at the same time. Due to how quickly {0.SimFirstName} was able to deliver {F0.her}{M0.his} project, it was placed at the top of the list. The party company gave {0.SimPronounObjective} a party bonus!
The client was obviously upset, but it was also the most entertaining phone call {0.SimFirstName} has had in a while. Couple that with still being paid a bit of money for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, and {0.SimFirstName} is left with a very confusing feeling.
The deadline was a bit too tight to polish the game enough for the immersion to shine through. Still, the job was done and {0.SimFirstName} was paid.
The game actually brought a tear to {0.SimFirstName}'s eye. Driven to finish it so {F0.she}{M0.he} could play it {F0.herself}{M0.himself}, {F0.she}{M0.he} ended up delivering way ahead of schedule. This was well appreciated by the game director, and {0.SimFirstName} was paid extra!
{0.SimFirstName} received an earful about &quot;not being motivated enough&quot; and &quot;failing to see the vision&quot;. It was upsetting, but at least the client still transferred a portion of the expected pay.
“The silly natural of your writing as left many in our clownish workspace entertained. Witty and Wacky Inc. thanks you for providing more than the traditional double entendre and simple quip or quote.” Well it seems like the client was happy, but why was their message a video of a man in military garb?
“Here at Witty and Wacky, we value all things illogical, flacky, and stupid. Therefore, we find your wisecracks, joshing, and irrational literature a HA of highest order. You elevate puns to daffy escapades, your one-liners leave us as empty-headed ninnies, and your gags are anything but offbeat. It has been a ludicrious journey and wish to put up with your tomfoolery again in the future.”\n Along with Witty and Wacky Inc.’s message, a large bonus was added to the contracted amount. Though why they went out of their way to make their logo sing about the bonus is anyone’s guess.
“Dear Sir, Madam, or Thing,\nAs the period between the life and death of this commission has passed, Witty and Wacky Inc. has decided not to extend this parody of a commission further. As there were a few HAs and many stifled snigger at your provided work, we will be paying you equivalent to the contract amount of an absurdist in our puns department.\n May your days be nonsensical and full of buffoonery,\n Witty and Wacky Inc. ”
The website's editor sighed as {0.SimFirstName} submitted a meaningless listicle, designed to drive clicks without having anything of significance to say. {0.SimFirstName} had seen this weary look on editor's faces before... The recognition that this isn't what they envisioned their life being when they earned their journalism degree. Oh well; not {0.SimFirstName}'s problem! On to the next gig.
Clicks are pouring in from across the internet as readers debate the wild claims {0.SimFirstName} laid out in an article which was clearly devised to drive controversy and outrage. The website's editor couldn't be happier - {0.SimFirstName} even went so far as to format the article across a paginated slideshow, ginning up even more revenue! Happily, the gig's contract included revenue sharing after meeting a certain click threshold, resulting in some extra money making its way into {0.SimFirstName}'s pocket.
{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete one of the simplest tasks imaginable... churning out some clickbait drivel. Thankfully the website's editor didn't particularly care; after all, freelancers like {0.SimFirstName} are a dime a dozen. {0.SimFirstName} still managed to get paid for the portion of the work {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to complete, so the gig wasn't a total write off.
While the topic of {0.SimFirstName}’s article wasn’t too interesting, {F0.her}{M0.his} writing was able to punch it up enough to catch the attention of Fab Magazine editors. Enough so to get its headline featured as one of the additional articles mentioned on the cover. Not bad for a story covering a few lesser known Plumbob Picture stars.
