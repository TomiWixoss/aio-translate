Rejected!
{0.SimFirstName} has heard of traps like this before. Leaving the artifacts untouched, {M0.he}{F0.she}  pockets a few of the more unusual-looking rocks and returns to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. {M0.He}{F0.She} should have just enough fuel left to return home and report {M0.his}{F0.her} amazing discovery.

Be Rescued
{0.SimName} has been rescued.
A child Sim in a previously played Household has been rescued. What do you want to do?
Plead for Object
&quot;Wow... You actually have nothing of value for me to repossess. I guess you've really lost it all. I'm going to have to come back if you don't start paying off your debts, and I don't think either of us wants that, do we?&quot;
{0.SimFirstName} tried to fight off the Repo Person, but just got slammed. Maybe next time, {F0.she}{M0.he} should try just paying {F0.her}{M0.his} bill.
{0.SimFirstName} successfully &quot;persuaded&quot; the Repo Person to leave their beloved possessions alone. Hopefully, the utility company will lay off for a while now. 
{0.SimFirstName} tried to buy off the Repo Person, but when a Sim is that deep in debt it's hard to buy off anyone. Maybe next time, {F0.she}{M0.he} should try &quot;bribing&quot; the bank with a small payment on {F0.her}{M0.his} loans...
{0.SimFirstName} successfully &quot;persuaded&quot; the Repo Person to leave their beloved possessions alone. Hopefully, the collections agency will lay off for a while now. 
Ask Not to Take Object
Argue to Keep
Appeal To Humanity
{0.SimFirstName} tried to appeal to Repo Person's emotions, but they must have a heart of stone. Maybe next time, {F0.she}{M0.he} should try just paying {F0.her}{M0.his} bill instead.
Repossess Object
{0.SimFirstName}'s possessions have been repossessed, and are no longer {0.SimPronounPossessiveIndependent} anymore. This has somewhat helped {0.SimPronounObjective} to dig {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of debt. However, if {M0.he}{F0.she} still owes more money, {M0.he}{F0.she} had better pay it or else {M0.he}{F0.she} can expect more visits from the friendly neighborhood Repo Person.
