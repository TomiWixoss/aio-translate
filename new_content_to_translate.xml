  <Text Key="07A7C59B1FC0">Concerned about Pecorine’s condition, Creditta accepted a proposal from the mysterious creature HaniHani-chan and held the Landsol Expo. Princesses from other worlds were invited, filling the city with energy, but Pecorine—burdened by the backlash of the royal equipment and her sense of guilt—had still lost her appetite.</Text>
  <Text Key="6B4063CB4D71">With the opening of the Landsol Expo, princesses from various nations are invited to Landsol to compete in their culinary skills. As {playername} and the others act as guides and tour each pavilion, a shadow watches them from afar.</Text>
  <Text Key="6677897CC7D0">Bistro Princess was planned as a forceful measure to cure Pecorine’s loss of appetite. The princesses of each nation also agreed to participate, staking their national pride for the sake of their friend. On the day of the decisive battle, the completely packed stadium was engulfed in a frenzy of excitement.</Text>
  <Text Key="54B116656E86">Just as the cooking showdown began, traps had been set within the food at the venue. Audience members and judges who tasted it lost their reason amid an abnormal surge of exhilaration. The mastermind behind the chaos was Melissa the Hellish Bee, one of the Six Calamities whom HaniHani-chan serves.</Text>
  <Text Key="DF7BDB409538">The reason the audience collapsed was Melissa’s poison mixed into the food. Her goal was to destroy the walls between worlds and reign as the sole queen. With her despicable scheme, Violet fell victim, and the venue was plunged into an unprecedented despair.</Text>
  <Text Key="0E5CBF4BB62D">Violet eats the dish imbued with her people’s feelings and awakens her true power together with her nation’s pride. With her newfound strength she overwhelms the enemy, but a cornered Melissa takes Pecorine hostage. {playername} and the others swear to rise again and make a temporary retreat.</Text>
  <Text Key="DD6E2882A185">As Landsol sinks into terror at Melissa’s hands, the retreating {playername} and their allies discover that Violet’s awakening was caused by legendary ingredients. Seeking ingredients from across the worlds that hold the key to detoxification and renewal, the party sets out once more.</Text>
  <Text Key="FD1854D2E105">Convinced that dishes made with legendary ingredients can neutralize the poison, {playername} and the others answer Melissa’s declaration of war. To rescue their captured comrades and Pecorine, the party begins its march toward the decisive battlefield—Landsol.</Text>
  <Text Key="EF5AD5A15689">Just before the guardian knights are executed, Lylael and the others—having overcome the poison with legendary ingredients—arrive as reinforcements. Their comrades are freed, and the people rise up. To save the captured Pecorine, the counterattack of {playername} and the three princesses begins now.</Text>

  <Text Key="4398C146A218">Touched by the people’s pride as they stand against the monster horde, Lylael and Nefi-Nera achieve their true awakenings as well. The three awakened princesses fight together and wipe out the enemy, but the rampaging Melissa attempts to flee into the sky—when, astonishingly, the escaped Pecorine appears.</Text>

  <Text Key="92D14D6BE658">It seems that lately, the people of Geo Theogonia have been learning about the culture of “aesthetic appeal” through exchanges with Landsol. Not just enjoying the taste, but sharing joy with friends through sweets—that, apparently, is the real charm.</Text>
  <Text Key="FC2E0259714F">Let’s try making some “Instagrammable” sweets ourselves. We’ll aim for sweets that make time spent with friends even more fun♪</Text>
  <Text Key="65FD754225E9">Pant… huff… w-what an incredible sweet! A must-share, cutting-edge look with the trendiest taste! Right now, I’m basically… a top-tier school-caste girl!</Text>
  <Text Key="4E1E3719943E">Such overwhelming bliss…! Not only does it look amazing, but just eating it feels like dreams come true… Club president, isn’t this a huge invention!?</Text>
  <Text Key="69F9ADB0E431">…Ah! I’m sorry, my social skills went out of control and I said something nonsensical… That was just a hallucination—no, a dream—shown by the aesthetic sweets.</Text>
  <Text Key="9D7CAE86DF00">In reality, even if a loner like me pretends to be outgoing, it’s still just a dream. But… it was a happy dream. If I immerse myself in it, I can avert my eyes from reality…</Text>
  <Text Key="906256E7AFF9">But Aoi has a friend—Croce, doesn’t she? Lately, she talks about you quite often.</Text>
  <Text Key="16683321ECA1">You called, so here I am—Aoi’s best friend, Croce! Actually, my eating-related functions have been upgraded♪ That means I can enjoy sweets together with you now, Aoi!</Text>
  <Text Key="44DFF210B7D7">Th-then it’s okay if we eat Lylael’s sweets together…!? Hehehe… hehehe… Even someone like me can finally join the ranks of the socially fulfilled, right!?</Text>
  <Text Key="5171A560F45B">Yes! First, we need to go have Grandpa Popo change my body! Let’s head out right away!</Text>
  <Text Key="AC2746727F42">Ah, wait, wait, wait—that way of holding me gives me a bad feeling! My clothes are going to tear again—this time physically—!!</Text>
  <Text Key="04483095543E">Today’s menu is fried sweets. When dough rich with flour and butter is fried in sweet sugar-palm oil, it becomes a treat with a crisp texture and a simple sweetness you’ll get addicted to.</Text>

  <Text Key="727170E98066">Hah… I feel like I’m dreaming, even seeing visions. The gentle sweetness makes my body feel light and fluffy, and my heart’s still pounding…</Text>

  <Text Key="CBEB5BAA9568">And then… last time we only talked about the MahoMaho Kingdom, but may I invite you to our castle, Lylael?</Text>
  <Text Key="653219118D31">The entire nation will welcome you. I’m sure you’ll come to love the MahoMaho Kingdom too♪</Text>
  <Text Key="A62847B2198A">Oh, I would love that. But where exactly is the MahoMaho Kingdom located?</Text>
  <Text Key="6CFD2DAE00B2">Ufufu, that’s something to enjoy once we get there… Then let’s invite you to the MahoMaho Kingdom right now♪</Text>
  <Text Key="C148A6ABD910">Eh, right now? But I still have sweets to make here…</Text>

  <Text Key="3B508E826B0E">Geo Theogonia’s specialties aren’t just sweet desserts.\nThis fizzy cream has a popping texture that bursts in your mouth.\nThis time, let’s use it to make some exciting sweets.</Text>
  <Text Key="854FB43625D8">I used to dislike fizzy textures and avoided them myself…\nBut lately I’ve come to appreciate their appeal.\nLet’s enjoy a more mature flavor together.</Text>
  <Text Key="ADCAE9372CAD">I-I think I just made a strange noise…\nBut that’s how delicious this cream puff is!</Text>
  <Text Key="21770A430012">The刺激 as it goes down your throat is like drinking fizzy malt…!\nAnd the rich, full-bodied cream gives real satisfaction!\nAfter the fizz fades, the sweetness spreads through your mouth… I’m hooked!</Text>
  <Text Key="85AC5EE1C20B">This could change the whole idea of “a beer after work”!\nSweet things at a party are taboo? No, not at all!</Text>
  <Text Key="7A95DA8AEBD5">A tired worker’s brain\nis always craving sugar and fizzy malt!!</Text>

  <Text Key="4A65951DD434">I wanna get totally woozy~\nand completely out of it~!\nPleeease! Ehehehehe~♪</Text>
  <Text Key="20A01960E439">Of course, please help yourself.\nSeeing you enjoy it this much is the greatest reward for a cook.</Text>
  <Text Key="03854C6FF834">…Though I didn’t use any ingredients that would cause that…\nPerhaps it’s all in the mind.\nFood truly is a profound thing.</Text>
  <Text Key="0974E08C7A0B">Geo Theogonia has a great variety of sweets.\nNot just wild ones—making them yourself has its own charm.\nI often enjoy making sweets like this, too.</Text>
  <Text Key="A68C6D3248FF">They’re very popular with visitors from other worlds as well.\nNot just the taste, but the cute appearance wins people over.\nCome, Knight—please help with the hospitality.</Text>
  <Text Key="1DBD1213FDD4">Hah… hah… I couldn’t help making a sound…\nIt’s delicious and cute… I’ve never had anything like this…</Text>
  <Text Key="A06F75002B82">Ah, geez… You saw a side of me that’s not like me at all…\nI never expected you to be here too,\nThis is so awkward…</Text>
  <Text Key="68039B02131B">Hehe, did you like it?\nIt’s one of Geo Theogonia’s finest cute sweets.\nIt’s only natural it would make you gasp.</Text>
  <Text Key="32105784BC8D">Absolutely flawless.\nNot just the looks, but the taste and texture are all adorable too—\nThat’s unfair. Even I lost myself…</Text>
  <Text Key="09E235360A30">So, um… about me getting carried away and making weird noises…\nIf you could keep that just between us… I’d appreciate it…</Text>
  <Text Key="806552CA3395">Yes, indeed, Knight.\nI completely agree…♪</Text>
  <Text Key="9319998BD887">T-That’s why!\nI usually maintain a serious image!\nSo please, I’m begging you—keep it secret!</Text>
  <Text Key="533FF3574D6B">Tomo-chan, you were really cute.</Text>
  <Text Key="9DE87A7C8C47">Survival of the fittest. The act of eating is nothing less than a battle where lives are wagered upon one another—\nLeave an opening in your heart, and you will be defeated at once, ending up on the victor’s table.\nSuch is the one absolute law of the purgatorial lands.</Text>
  <Text Key="A2D49124CFFC">Even a fish upon the cutting board must not be underestimated.\nLook away for but a moment, and it may bare its fangs.\nEat this dish, and you will learn its meaning whether you wish to or not…</Text>
  <Text Key="75D8D3246035">…Hah! W-What was that just now?\nIt felt like my whole body was being sliced apart…\nWas I seeing some kind of hallucination?</Text>
  <Text Key="CFA7255586B1">Korokoro—\nWhat you have just tasted is a dish made from a cutlassfish that dwells in Geo Gehenna.\nIts blade remains sharp even in death, striking at those who consume it.</Text>
  <Text Key="34DD930778AB">When one faces mortal danger, all senses are sharpened.\nTaste is no exception… and thus this dish is considered exquisite,\nfavored by fearless warriors who laugh in the face of death.</Text>
  <Text Key="8CA6F991E625">It really was insanely good, but…\nAre you saying it tasted that way because I was focused to the point of death?\nThe world’s a big place—there really are unbelievable dishes out there…</Text>
  <Text Key="622B499BFD35">With proper blade-removal preparation, it will not prove fatal, so please rest easy.\nHowever, those of keen talent may unconsciously perceive the attacking sword aura\nand see visions of the battlefield—just as Lady Luka did earlier.</Text>
  <Text Key="B850950AF10A">Well, that’s not exactly reassuring.\nEven if it was a vision, being cut down one-sidedly would disgrace a female samurai.\nI’ll take another serving and settle the score.</Text>
  <Text Key="264053447830">Splendid spirit indeed—however, we have run out of cutlassfish.\nIf Lady Luka is amenable, you may go catch one yourself.\nWe have all the fishing gear prepared here.</Text>
  <Text Key="F2AD8B4B039C">No problem—I’m confident in my fishing skills too—\nBut what’s that? Full-body armor Jun would love?\nThat’s awfully heavy-duty for fishing gear…</Text>
  <Text Key="89ED74C77905">The cutlassfish dwell within scorching lava flows erupting from the purgatorial earth.\nApproach without preparation, and you will be reduced to charcoal merely by drawing near…\nDo take care, korokoro—</Text>
  <Text Key="04F87F3732BE">Just how wild is Geo Gehenna!?\nBut a fisherman can’t resist a challenge…\nYou’re coming with me—let’s go!</Text>
  <Text Key="80E5B456F0FC">The monsters infesting Geo Gehenna are bizarre and endlessly diverse.\nFor example, this one here—a massive bird that soars through the skies.\nIts size is impressive, and its weight matches it.</Text>
  <Text Key="017CF69C1095">It may not rival the Kaleid Phoenix, but capturing and eating it is no small feat.\nThat said, the nourishment it provides is guaranteed.\nThink of it as training alongside a meal.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3AB6AFA99E6">…Hah!?\nMy armor… i-is it intact…?\nSorry—please ignore that…</Text>
  <Text Key="26F179BAA968">Still, Geo Gehenna’s cuisine is astonishing.\nA torrent of protein surges through the body; its oil-glossed surface looks as tough as rock,\nyet is tender, filling and refining the flesh itself.</Text>
  <Text Key="67E8A965C770">I am deeply impressed, Princess.\nNever before have I eaten a dish that resonated so directly with my body,\nmaking my very blood and flesh dance.</Text>
  <Text Key="D2E23B1730C7">To receive praise from a warrior of your caliber makes all the effort worthwhile.\nCome now, do not stop at a single bite.\nThe Knight is watching with shining eyes, eager for this dish prepared with care.</Text>
  <Text Key="A4C7D9226EAB">N-No!\nI appreciate the thought, but I still have patrol duties at the venue!\nPlease excuse me!!</Text>
  <Text Key="2B0650C12053">What a pity.\nLady Jun’s disheveled state would have been far too fine an entertainment\nfor only a single viewing.</Text>
  <Text Key="D36A82243A06">Purgatory, Geo Gehenna—its myriad monsters differ wildly in both strength and flavor.\nThe meat of flame-clad beasts becomes fragrant depending on how it is seared.\nAs for poisonous monsters, with proper preparation their flesh yields medicinal effects.</Text>
  <Text Key="237F1FC10350">Now then, if all such meats were simmered together in a gently bubbling pot,\nwhat manner of result would come to pass?\nThe secrets of Geo Gehenna–style hotpot—pray, behold the finished dish.</Text>
  <Text Key="F1F38F2B8F50">Hah… haa… fuu…\nI got swept up by the unexpected turn of events… my body’s all flushed.\nAnd my heart’s still racing, like after finishing an adventure novel.</Text>
  <Text Key="78C9E9C56E53">Ah, it’s not that I’m feeling unwell.\n…it’s just really delicious.</Text>
  <Text Key="CCD0104EBBBA">So this is the taste of purgatorial monsters… a little spicy, and it feels good for the body.\nI can see myself getting hooked.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D31BF97E1DC">I am pleased that it resonated with Lady Shiori’s palate.\nYet these monsters are but a mere fraction of purgatory’s delicacies.\nIn its hidden realms lie countless monsters—and cuisines yet undiscovered.</Text>
  <Text Key="67CCB6A5288D">There’s still so much in Geo Gehenna that I don’t know.\nI really want to go there again!</Text>
  <Text Key="5F97CC2EC62D">—Korokoro.\nIf Lady Shiori so desires,\nI shall guide you there at any time.</Text>
  <Text Key="105F8CE085B5">Caverns of boiling magma, ancient ruins swirling with miasma, chaotic plains where spirits rage—\nAll shall become a grand adventure yet unseen.\nWe shall make all preparations; please come when ready.</Text>
  <Text Key="41BFA127A72D">R-Really…?\nPlease, I’d love that! I need to prepare lots of things…\nFirst of all, I should start training my body.</Text>
  <Text Key="C3FAD7B5A3BA">I’ll definitely become stronger!\nStrong enough to venture into Geo Gehenna’s hidden regions…\nCornelia, please train with me!</Text>
  <Text Key="F2B25AA919BB">At a festive venue such as this, the hearts of the people naturally grow lively.\nTo create a dish that delights all—young and old alike…\nThat is indeed a vexing challenge.</Text>
  <Text Key="ECB8979C7F30">Since stirring the hearts of all is exceedingly difficult,\nwe shall first craft a dish to delight the innocent children.\nWith the Knight’s help, it shall surely turn out delicious.</Text>
  <Text Key="955BC7CDEEDC">Hah, hah… kuh kuh kuh…\nIt surges… it surges…!\nI can feel the dark magic hidden within me rising!</Text>
  <Text Key="9B139ED170DC">With a single bite, juices gush forth like flowing blood…\nWhat rests upon the tongue is not hellfire, but a gentle flame’s blessing.\nThe mingling spice and savor form a truly forbidden feast!</Text>
  <Text Key="47FC63FDD7E2">The fried batter’s so crispy and delicious—\nN-No! A golden armor that lures people into gluttonous ruin!\nAs expected of the ruler of purgatory… your skill is worthy of my recognition as an ally!</Text>
  <Text Key="45B28FD1AECE">—Korokoro.\nHow unexpected—such lavish praise.\nI merely prepared it so that young children could eat it easily.</Text>
  <Text Key="D8EF6B04E10D">Eh… c-children…?</Text>
  <Text Key="DDD2443559D2">Indeed.\nTo borrow your term…\nYou might call it a “kids’ lunch,” perhaps?</Text>
  <Text Key="18CA8BABD18D">Waaaaah!!!\nD-Don’t look, Sigurd! Don’t look at me like this!!</Text>
  <Text Key="DFEDAF273D1C">Come to think of it, there’s a dessert recipe Yukino taught me the other day…\nI was thinking of trying to make it.\nWould you mind lending me a hand, Knight?</Text>
  <Text Key="F7BC7EB1A433">This recipe apparently has medicinal effects that are good for the throat.\nBy adding an appropriate amount of ice from the Eternal Glacier, along with fruit, herbs, and sugar—</Text>
  <Text Key="0972CEC748AF">…Ah.\nW-What was that just now… a-ah, a-ah…♪\nM-My throat feels better already…!</Text>
  <Text Key="7C7601DCD2AA">The clear aroma of medicinal herbs fills the nose without being overpowering…\nThe refined coolness harmonizes with a gentle sweetness,\nLike a symphony… it feels as though even the spirits are rejoicing!</Text>
  <Text Key="C3B7D0361540">Hehe, what a lovely singing voice.\nIf this was of help to someone like you, Chika,\nI’m sure Yukino would be happy as well.</Text>
  <Text Key="DEA038AD66FD">~♪\nAmazing… it feels like my vocal range has expanded compared to before!\nNot just that—my volume and vibrato have improved so much too…!</Text>
  <Text Key="C3B51900BB74">I want to recommend this to Nozomi, Tsumugi, and Ranpha too…\nViolet, would it be all right if we all visited Geo Nivruhel sometime?\nI’d love for everyone to try this frozen dessert.</Text>
  <Text Key="0FC83119A7AF">I’m sure they’d love it♪\nAnd then maybe Carmina and Ranpha could even do a live performance together!</Text>
  <Text Key="41FF47ACB053">We’ve never performed in Geo Nivruhel before…\nI’m sure the producer would agree!\nI’ll go talk to them right away! Thank you for the meal!</Text>
  <Text Key="6F83A363EFB7">I-I don’t think it was supposed to be that effective…\nOh dear, things are getting bigger and bigger,\nKnight…!</Text>
  <Text Key="180F6F37DF6F">Geo Nivruhel is a land of silence, filled with the presence of death.\nCompared to other worlds, it may seem like a lonely place,\nFar removed from bustling streets and lively crowds.</Text>
  <Text Key="A16199A92D30">But even in such a land, many forms of culture thrive.\nSince this is such a rare opportunity,\nI would like everyone to taste dishes that reflect the life of this world…</Text>
  <Text Key="DC880F242ACE">…It’s truly delicious, yet vague and hazy, delicate and inscrutable…!\nIt goes down the throat swiftly and gracefully like a fish in a clear stream,\nYet the aftertaste fades so fleetingly it never allows you to grow intoxicated…</Text>
  <Text Key="F2CB0DC40FFA">Only a faint trace remains on the tongue—yet the satisfaction is irresistible.\nThe flavor changes with every bite, staying fresh and utterly addictive!\nIt’s my first time having no clue whatsoever about the ingredients or method!!</Text>
  <Text Key="138A8E6D5FDD">I’m truly honored that you enjoyed it.\nIt’s a rare dish, even within Geo Nivruhel.\nI recreated it from an old book in the archives of the Great Whale Castle…</Text>
  <Text Key="499BDCBDFF11">Please, Princess of Geo Nivruhel.\nWould you tell me what it’s made of?\nThis is a business opportunity! It’s guaranteed to be a huge success!</Text>
  <Text Key="EDF82FBFF1BC">Business…?\nUm, you mean… selling this dish to someone?</Text>
  <Text Key="AF53A6F4348F">Exactly! It would be a sensation in other worlds as well—guaranteed to be a hit!\nPeople would be captivated by this mysterious cuisine, and before long,\nGeo Nivruhel would be bustling with visitors!</Text>
  <Text Key="39991F9D5B04">If Geo Nivruhel were to gain such liveliness,\nI would be delighted as well.\nHowever…</Text>
  <Text Key="F01D9E1054E5">Is there some kind of problem?</Text>
  <Text Key="DD3680CADCDC">The truth is… this dish changes in both flavor and appearance every time it’s made and eaten.\nJust like the finished dish, the ingredients themselves keep changing.\nReproducing it is extremely difficult, and providing it consistently is—</Text>
  <Text Key="1F40721E99CE">Oh my, how wonderful!\nA once-in-a-lifetime flavor—there could be no greater experiential value!</Text>
  <Text Key="CF64498B9088">Come now, Violet, let’s start planning at once!\nAs business partners spanning worlds!\nThis is where we show our skills—oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!!</Text>
  <Text Key="63041524A6F3">A-Awah… could it be that I’m being swept up into something outrageous…?\nG-Grace, please help me…!</Text>
  <Text Key="B6795C107FCA">Lately, there’s been a food gaining attention in Geo Nivruhel.\nA sweet, jiggly dessert with an adorable appearance—\nIt seems to be spreading among the people after a certain girl’s visit.</Text>
  <Text Key="E6F702143B09">It’s called pudding… hehe, even the name is adorable.\nI think I’ll try my hand at making it too.\nKnight, as an expert, please help me.</Text>
  <Text Key="9883E1C26B20">This thing’s pudding! It was sweet and tasty and totally pudding!\nIt looks completely different, but it’s still pudding…\nIt was super jiggly!</Text>
  <Text Key="4808279C7B22">It was so jiggly that even Miyako’s clothes… huh?\n…Was that just my imagination?\nBut I’m sure my clothes popped— it surprised me…</Text>
  <Text Key="1BB8FE2B1419">Did something unusual happen when you ate it…?\nThe ingredients were sourced in Landsol,\nAnd when Grace taste-tested it, nothing seemed out of the ordinary…</Text>
  <Text Key="085F892CFB80">Ah, that must be my own inadequacy.\nI failed to live up to the Princess’s expectations\nAnd missed my chance to crack a joke—how foolish of me. Oh dear.</Text>
  <Text Key="BB050945D726">Grace, you were there!?\nAnd even then, I wasn’t expecting you to play the fool…</Text>
  <Text Key="46897D88A5CF">No, no, Princess. With top-tier wraith power,\nIt’s only natural for a pudding’s impact to burst a garment or two.\nRight, Miyako-senpai? As expected—respect.</Text>
  <Text Key="1CADAEDCD32A">Hmm~? …That’s right, Miyako is amazing!\nSo you should respect Miyako-senpai too!\nProof of respect is more pudding! Make lots of it!</Text>
  <Text Key="D8D2FAAA5AD8">U-Understood, Senpai…\nI’ll prepare more right away.</Text>
  <Text Key="8F083611F673">After that, Miyako continued demanding refills in the grip of her pudding cravings,\nAnd the ingredients were depleted in no time.</Text>
  <Text Key="2B0794AB7406">Today, a special blue fish has arrived from Geo Nivruhel.\nAh, please don’t worry, Knight.\nBy “blue fish,” I do not mean a zombie fish…</Text>
  <Text Key="66F56C2104FD">This fish is highly nutritious, especially rich in components said to improve intelligence.\nIt’s also drawing attention for its effect in slowing zombie progression.\nRecommended for students as well—let’s grill it right away.</Text>
  <Text Key="597B35E43C02">Hah… hah…\nThis is… my first time experiencing something like this…\nI can’t even stand anymore…</Text>
  <Text Key="57FF62A025D6">The flesh is so fluffy—my hype’s through the roof~!\nEven the skin, the bones, even the eyes…\nThere’s nothing you’d throw away!</Text>
  <Text Key="1F1913AB68FE">T-That’s good to hear…\nThe eyeballs of this fish are rich in docosahexaenoic acid,\nWhich is said to be good for the brain.</Text>
  <Text Key="656F519F1B48">Seriously!?\nSo my brain feeling all sharp right now is thanks to that…\nAnta-gata docosa… hexa… stuff?\nMaybe I could even become a teacher at this rate♪</Text>
  <Text Key="59BEF73178E3">So here’s a question!\n“What percent off is 30% off?” Answer me, Viole— huh?\nWhat color is Violet again? Purple? Then answer, Sumipe♪</Text>
  <Text Key="5E0534554142">Sumipe… me?\nIt’s true that I also go by the name Sumire, but…\n…Um, well. Isn’t 30% off… just 30% off…?</Text>
  <Text Key="B61A6C03139C">Ooh~ amazing, that’s totally correct!!\nCould it be that Sumipe is the smart type!?</Text>
  <Text Key="98A4FF1CE903">Then hey, hey—let’s study together next time!\nI’ll invite you to a family restaurant after school, okay~♪</Text>
  <Text Key="171AEE694843">Ah… y-yes.\nOka~y… indeed…</Text>
  <Text Key="3CC110EF8CE6">The Princess Angel and Harmony</Text>
  <Text Key="AC9A30954F35">I am truly grateful to everyone for working together. Even though there was the possibility of being attacked by monsters… hehe, I am so proud of my people.</Text>
  <Text Key="650FEAAA4052">…Please forgive my people’s rudeness… I never imagined they would build a house for you, Knight… and even take the consideration to make it so I could live there too… but, um… I don’t mind, you know…?</Text>
  <Text Key="CF535AA41FB3">If I could watch over the future of our country and people together with you… I’m sure it would be happiness. Please allow me to dream like that, just for now, Knight.</Text>
  <Text Key="D635183477BA">Knight… you truly are a mysterious person. You stay by my side when I want you there, and when I need encouragement, you give me words that fill me with courage.</Text>
  <Text Key="BE8D70C9008C">Allow me to once again express my gratitude. Thanks to the help you gave me, Knight, I was able to truly connect with Wurm. I am sincerely thankful.</Text>
  <Text Key="B6908C002C0A">The moment you fed me that tart, Knight, I saw a hallucination where my clothes burst apart… surely that wasn’t magic that fulfilled your hidden desires… right?</Text>
  <Text Key="283229934EB6">Hehe… I am a princess who represents her nation, and also one of “Pride,” so I won’t let things end with me on the receiving end. Be prepared, Knight—next time, it’s your turn♪</Text>
  <Text Key="08986A817B56">Hehe, perhaps I’ve been getting a bit carried away as I spend more time with you. Maybe because my heart feels lighter, I’m floating just a little higher than usual♪</Text>
  <Text Key="2018BF8382E8">But these feelings are genuine. Your presence and your words have supported me and given me courage. You—no one else but you, my beloved…</Text>
  <Text Key="589664687622">If it were possible… I would like to keep making sweets for you forever from now on. Hehe, that might truly be called “prideful,” wouldn’t it?</Text>
  <Text Key="493957CA4E8C">When you happily eat the sweets I carefully made from Geo Theogonia, my chest grows so warm… it makes me feel like I’m floating.</Text>
  <Text Key="3B26C1DAAC91">Happy birthday. Please enjoy this cake made with plenty of fruit harvested in Geo Theogonia.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3EE8A79F146">Next, I’d love to hold a “Geo Theogonia Expo.” The people would surely welcome it. I’ll put my heart into making sweets as well.</Text>
  <Text Key="BF79C806B8E4">I do not like conflict, but when it becomes a contest bearing the fate of a nation, it’s another matter… yes, getting fired up isn’t for the prizes, certainly not…</Text>
  <Text Key="791012E2D7F6">Having you by my side as I stand here as a princess makes me feel so reassured. It makes me wish… that we could always be together.</Text>
  <Text Key="E1837D5C3FF2">The time when you eat my sweets is special to me—it makes me feel a little shy, and my heart starts pounding. Let’s keep it a secret from everyone, okay…?</Text>
  <Text Key="255EC301AAB6">Interacting with princesses and chevaliers from other worlds was thrilling, even amidst the crisis. The same goes for交流 with the people of other nations.</Text>
  <Text Key="52FB834E40F8">Today is a special day—your birthday, Knight. How about an aerial stroll together? I’ll give you the beautiful scenery of Geo Theogonia, just for you.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0B516AE2ED9">Geo Theogonia—this world I love so dearly gives me strength. I will protect it from any enemy.</Text>
  <Text Key="FFA92E662E37">My wings have become a little stiffer… but now I can fly swiftly, like Croce. Come, hold on, Knight.</Text>
  <Text Key="8BD87281E093">I will not forgive anyone who threatens peace. As the princess of Geo Theogonia, I shall wield this power for everyone.</Text>
  <Text Key="F9B392F38C94">If I were only arrogant, I would have ended up a naked princess… but because there are those who give me guidance, I can remain myself.</Text>
  <Text Key="0ED2FE73BBB3">At times, I realize just how terribly prideful I am. I even find myself thinking of ways to keep you from leaving… Don’t worry, I won’t act on them… not yet, at least.</Text>

  <Text Key="9C60D3B528B5">Let&apos;s see... I believe they introduced themselves to each other? clearly in a very unique way...</Text>
  <Text Key="4CE591883077">YOU CANNOT! WAIT RIGHT THERE! PLEASE WAIT, RIA-SAN!---</Text>
  <Text Key="35921CAA21A8">QURIA...!</Text>
  <Text Key="46A19EE2F88C">RI..A...!</Text>
  <Text Key="C365882F954E">A short time before Alshat abducted Quria and Wyrm...</Text>
  <Text Key="56CE444DDBAD">However, they were assaulted by a horde of powerful monsters that erupted from beneath the island. Worse still, Quria was abducted by Alshat, leaving the group with no choice but to retreat to their campsite...</Text>
  <Text Key="D61D19B849D2">When we received a call that the missing Quria had been found in Geo Gehenna... They rushed out in a panic. It might have been a trap, so perhaps we should have tried to stop them more forcefully...</Text>
  <Text Key="1E4FD958473D">...Indeed, Lady Sheffy. Had we learned of my Lord&apos;s whereabouts, we would surely have acted the same way. That does not mean we are unconcerned for Lady Quria, of course...</Text>
  <Text Key="891325D624C4">My Lord and Lady Quria... where did you take them? Answer us at once. We do not have time to spare. Depending on your response... a spanking may not be enough.</Text>
  <Text Key="D6C73DF4AA03">──QURIA...!!</Text>
  <Text Key="B2A18F935B54">Quria. When I was lonely. She was there. She gave me lots of food.</Text>
  <Text Key="4FA45C3FE25C">Of course, that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m letting you free just yet. But I heard from Quria that you&apos;re good at cooking, Wakana-chan, correct?</Text>
  <Text Key="136EE52758B3">Likewise, my name is Quria. As for us... Umm... I think it&apos;ll be faster for you to understand if you see us in another form...</Text>
  <Text Key="4497AA8352E4">Lily-chan! Did you find Quria-chan?!</Text>
  <Text Key="0E8020E8FF5D">Quria-chan...!</Text>
  <Text Key="2B2CDF6DE1CA">...Lady Lily. You told us about the events that unfolded before we reached the throne room... That you fought Lady Quria and nearly perished yourself.</Text>
  <Text Key="93864903CAC7">That&apos;s right. No matter how you look at it, the enemy who misled Quria is in the wrong. Besides...</Text>
  <Text Key="04BA84A3F4D4">If you were to use the &quot;Resurrection Program&quot; that Labyrista-san gave you... I wonder if you&apos;d be able to return Quria-san&apos;s avatar to its original state.</Text>
  <Text Key="D4FA410828A2">If the fire on the chest of this ice statue is a visual representation of one&apos;s soul, then Lady Quria&apos;s fire is smaller, less bright, and more depleted compared to the one Lady Sheffy&apos;s had.</Text>
  <Text Key="55BE35934824">Excuse me, Lady Quria~</Text>
  <Text Key="0AE03C5CFC99">...By touching her directly like this... I can feel it more clearly. Lady Quria&apos;s sorrowful heart. Strong regret... a self-blame so strong it feels like it is crushing me...</Text>
  <Text Key="F604AF3A950E">Not only is Lady Quria&apos;s soul debilitated, but these negative emotions may be choking off her desire to be resurrected...</Text>
  <Text Key="FF6EF726103B">Well, then... I heard from Geo Teogonia that Wyrm was also captured and put in the same condition as Quria. Which means, Lisa too...?</Text>
  <Text Key="A4039BE48EF7">So even Lisa-san... has a royal equipment? Freyja-san has &quot;Ira(Wrath)&quot;, and the woman who kidnapped Quria also has one...</Text>
  <Text Key="9A98D0DCF3EB">...Yeah. {playername}&apos;s back with us, after all. We&apos;ll also do something about Quria one way or another... All that&apos;s left is...</Text>
