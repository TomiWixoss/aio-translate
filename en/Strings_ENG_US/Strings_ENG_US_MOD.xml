  <Text Key="8DA1AECA">{0.SimFirstName} was asked if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to have sex but that conversation was downright distasteful.</Text>
  <Text Key="4DD61AA2">Can I join in on the fun?</Text>
  <Text Key="4DA573FD">Sure, come on in.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D9E91EC">No, you cannot join in.</Text>
  <Text Key="5102FB59">No, nobody can join in.</Text>
  <Text Key="3B5C8D82">No, but you can watch.</Text>
  <Text Key="9A0B7AB2">Do you want to join in on the fun?</Text>
  <Text Key="14F2A678">Sure, I'm coming in.</Text>
  <Text Key="CAA87CD2">No, I don't want to join in.</Text>
  <Text Key="0C76017A">Is sleeping with the enemy supposed to be a bad thing? Would you like to find out for yourself?</Text>
  <Text Key="208C258D">Maybe then I won't hate you so much.</Text>
  <Text Key="DC54D9A9">I have always wondered that. We might as well!</Text>
  <Text Key="678B8719">I didn't think I could hate you more, but I do now!</Text>
  <Text Key="1805412F">I am too preoccupied to consider this right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3E2890A">Sometimes I really can't stand the sight of you but right now all I want to do is get down and dirty.\nWhat about you? What would you say to a romp in the hay?</Text>
  <Text Key="D4073820">I hate you too but I feel the same. Let's do it.</Text>
  <Text Key="2AC9178D">I don't think you realize just how much I hate you.</Text>
  <Text Key="433A9DC0">What makes you think I'd ever agree to that?</Text>
  <Text Key="80F48B57">When I see you I see only trash! But sometimes you just &lt;b&gt;NEED&lt;/b&gt; some junk food. Know what I mean?</Text>
  <Text Key="77ABC823">You're definitely not good for me. Let's do it!</Text>
  <Text Key="A9FF1AFA">I'd rather eat literal garbage.</Text>
  <Text Key="C1BE3BB2">Um... what?</Text>
  <Text Key="73883F88">Instead of ruining my day with your presence why don't you put that loose tongue of yours to good use for once, bend down and see how fast you can make me scream?</Text>
  <Text Key="DA93A9AD">Fine, get over here Asshole!</Text>
  <Text Key="31A773E2">I would rather lick a dead fish.</Text>
  <Text Key="04EADAEF">I won't degrade myself by bending down for you.</Text>
  <Text Key="656AF9B1">I hate you so much, but I also want to bang the hell out of you.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D6B7745">I get exactly what you mean. Let's act on that feeling.</Text>
  <Text Key="E7CAEB0E">You are being extremely weird. Leave me alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F144C11">What did you just say?</Text>
  <Text Key="64BB54B8">Have you ever heard of hate sex? I did, and I heard it can be one of the most memorable experiences in one's life.</Text>
  <Text Key="94E81ACE">Let's test that theory.</Text>
  <Text Key="CF9AB882">No, and I don't care to try it!</Text>
  <Text Key="88243FA5">Excuse me?</Text>
  <Text Key="32D7B236">Did you know that hate and lust are two sides of the same coin? Or was it love? I think it was lust.</Text>
  <Text Key="60486F21">So, you wanna get freaky?</Text>
  <Text Key="2B68F6D5">It was definitely love, and I don't have any for you.</Text>
  <Text Key="9FF8E1FF">I think I misheard you...</Text>
  <Text Key="D3DA559A">You really are desperate aren't you?</Text>
  <Text Key="A5E3084D">You know what? Screw you!</Text>

  <Text Key="D2AF0714">I honestly can't look at your face but we can always have sex with our eyes closed.</Text>
  <Text Key="87BBDFF5">Ok, first of all, rude. But let's do it anyway.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD031FAB">No, even if I had my eyes gouged out.</Text>
  <Text Key="2B06FFD7">I'm don't feel like even joking about that stuff.</Text>
  <Text Key="59D9A320">I know we're not on good terms, so do you wanna have sex and make up?</Text>
  <Text Key="800FDFF6">It's about time to bury the hatchet.</Text>
  <Text Key="95A2B057">We're not on good terms for a reason, dickhead.</Text>
  <Text Key="ADA87717">I don't wanna talk to you.</Text>
  <Text Key="3E4D2CE8">Let's make up first, talk sex later, ok?</Text>
  <Text Key="B495B802">Hey, you wanna bump uglies?</Text>
  <Text Key="A5A33FAE">Sure, let's get &lt;i&gt;naughty&lt;/i&gt;!</Text>
  <Text Key="BBD53BC5">You're disgusting. I will &lt;b&gt;NEVER&lt;/b&gt; have sex with you.</Text>
  <Text Key="DEE332FF">I'm not saying no, but I'm also not saying yes.</Text>
  <Text Key="03289E81">I don't know if we're ever going to be great friends, but we can at least have some great sex.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F4FE352">You better not disappoint me!</Text>
  <Text Key="B4C42EEE">Great sex? With you? What a joke.</Text>
  <Text Key="41C6406A">Why are you like this?</Text>
  <Text Key="CB87B8E3">We can still be friends you know? But don't force it.</Text>
  <Text Key="302D19FE">We don't know each other, but would you like to have some &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt; with me?</Text>
  <Text Key="5B437F44">You know what? Let's see how much fun we can have!</Text>
  <Text Key="8C7BD045">I'm not interested in any kind fun with strangers.</Text>
  <Text Key="0A2B8F23">Ugh, you sound so pathetic and desperate. No way!</Text>
  <Text Key="63DA841A">Um...that's creepy. Why would you even ask that?</Text>
  <Text Key="484F00DA">Hey there, I know we haven't spoken before, but as soon as I saw you I instantly felt a connection. What's say we take the plunge and have some &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;?</Text>
  <Text Key="BC03DE51">Sure! There's no better way to get to know someone.</Text>
  <Text Key="D426029D">I'd rather with anyone else but you.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D687B69">You're right, I don't know you so please go away.</Text>
  <Text Key="C49A9F76">Why excuse me {M1.Sir}{F1.Madam}, but I couldn't help but lose myself in your {M1.devilishly handsome aura}{F1.angelic beauty}.\nWe may not know one another but I have this deep hungering desire to discover as much as I can through the carnal act of skinship.</Text>
  <Text Key="D8642FDE">Indeed, let us intimately explore each other's bodies.</Text>
  <Text Key="B95C4FAF">You're probably the biggest creep I've met in a while.</Text>
  <Text Key="555FFF3A">I'm sorry but would you kindly... go away?</Text>
  <Text Key="C306900D">HEY!!! You! Me! Sex! &lt;b&gt;NOW!&lt;b&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="145F3840">That's not even a pick-up line but fine, LET'S DO THIS!</Text>
  <Text Key="CF9158C0">HEY. YOU. HELL. NO!</Text>
  <Text Key="CB7F8E1C">Does that ever actually work on people?</Text>
  <Text Key="312E8BEC">Hey there {M1.handsome}{F1.cutie}, wanna have some fun with a fun {M0.guy}{F0.girl} such as myself?</Text>
  <Text Key="590CC7FB">Sure, why not!</Text>
  <Text Key="5CF09A6F">No.</Text>
  <Text Key="7BA88045">Another time, maybe.</Text>
  <Text Key="5EA1862E">Get lost, creep!</Text>
  <Text Key="52700DC1">Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? I can give you a &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt; butt massage.</Text>
  <Text Key="A6142D89">Yeah, my butt's been killing me actually.</Text>
  <Text Key="E1932E0C">I actually crawled up from hell, it was pretty easy.</Text>
  <Text Key="6923BD7D">No, but when I do need a &lt;i&gt;massage&lt;/i&gt; I will call you!</Text>
  <Text Key="EB1ABE7E">Do you wanna leave here on a stretcher? Creep...</Text>
  <Text Key="ECF238D3">You look like you're fun in bed. Are you &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;?</Text>
  <Text Key="AC85D120">Oh, I can be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; fun... Can you handle it?</Text>
  <Text Key="442A776A">Nah, I'm very boring. I only use my bed to sleep in it.</Text>
  <Text Key="962F4A1D">What do you mean?</Text>
  <Text Key="C6F97470">I love your legs, but I think they would look better spread out.</Text>
  <Text Key="97ABAB21">I'm sure you will love what's between them.</Text>
  <Text Key="3F33A846">Leave. Me. Alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="33778EBE">My orthopedist wouldn't agree.</Text>
  <Text Key="0692BE27">And you would look better if you were walking away!</Text>
  <Text Key="D06B531C">I've heard my face is quite comfortable, wanna sit on it?</Text>
  <Text Key="DBBBC1EC">I did hear I make an excellent sitter.</Text>
  <Text Key="1474D210">Did you honestly think that would work?</Text>
  <Text Key="9F492C39">I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.</Text>
  <Text Key="D84A6374">I'd rather sit on nails.</Text>
  <Text Key="1528481D">Hey {1.SimFirstName}, I know we don't know each other that well but I think would be really good in the sack. I think we should skip the formalities and just go for it!</Text>
  <Text Key="4A994F25">Alright, let's go for it. Screw the Formalities!</Text>
  <Text Key="EFF707A8">What? No! Gross! Get away from me.</Text>
  <Text Key="EE0AB78C">I don't really know you enough to see you like that.</Text>
  <Text Key="7744C049">I know we don't know each other that well, but... would you like to have sex with me?</Text>
  <Text Key="EA73BA5E">I thought you would never ask!</Text>
  <Text Key="0281D7DE">Not interested.</Text>
  <Text Key="8C439ABA">You're direct, I like that, but now is not the time.</Text>
  <Text Key="B27CBC3B">You know what? I've had you on my dirty mind since I met you.</Text>
  <Text Key="0E627003">Funny, you haven't left my mind either!</Text>
  <Text Key="017CAD5B">Better cleanse that mind cause that's not happening.</Text>
  <Text Key="F77F46EC">We barely know each other, maybe one day...</Text>
  <Text Key="260E60AD">What makes you think it's okay to say that?</Text>
  <Text Key="F960A310">Is that a gnome in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?</Text>
  <Text Key="2508C2F7">Wanna find out for yourself?</Text>
  <Text Key="CA31AC87">I'm less happy to see you now that you've said that.</Text>
  <Text Key="F9030B59">How would one even fit a gnome into their pocket?</Text>
  <Text Key="FE7C6882">Did you really just say that?</Text>
  <Text Key="896EAC83">You give off vibes that make me feel we're sexually compatible. Wanna test that?</Text>
  <Text Key="DB847ED5">Guess there's only one way to test it!</Text>
  <Text Key="ABD75254">And you give off creep vibes. No thanks.</Text>
  <Text Key="FBCB2758">I'm not vibing with that idea right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="70A0BC8E">Would you like to take part in a mating ritual involving at least you and me?</Text>
  <Text Key="EEAF7E8A">You &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; look like a suitable mate. Let's do it!</Text>
  <Text Key="8F54910E">Mating with you doesn't seem beneficial, so no.</Text>
  <Text Key="1EEEA7A6">It's not mating season just yet.</Text>
  <Text Key="C7839663">There is a possibility of more people? Sign me in!</Text>
  <Text Key="60D56751">Hey, you want to get lucky with me?</Text>
  <Text Key="62B2C00E">Well lucky you, because I do!</Text>
  <Text Key="0F9267C9">That sounds like bad luck though.</Text>
  <Text Key="0BBBFBAB">Not in a mood, but try your luck again sometime!</Text>
  <Text Key="19436E87">I think we should skip the 'getting to know each other' part, and just have sex. Preferably right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="F2900020">Wonderful idea!</Text>
  <Text Key="3CFF0170">Oh, I don't even wanna get to know you, creep!</Text>
  <Text Key="8977CECF">But I actually like that part...</Text>
  <Text Key="3EE2A971">We should get to know each other better. &lt;i&gt;Physically&lt;/i&gt;.</Text>
  <Text Key="A592377B">Agreed. Best way of strengthening a relation.</Text>
  <Text Key="E4317819">We really should not. Ever.</Text>
  <Text Key="C2DF7B58">I'd like to get to know you as a person first.</Text>
  <Text Key="1E201DBA">I'm from the future. We need to have sex right now or the space-time continuum will collapse!</Text>
  <Text Key="8451EEAF">Oh no! Not the space-time continuum! Quickly!</Text>
  <Text Key="0808EB6D">You're not from the future. You're full of crap.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C5B94DE">Heard that one before. You might wanna redo.</Text>
  <Text Key="25816B34">My horoscope told me I am going to have sex this week... so I thought I would ask.</Text>
  <Text Key="702E751C">Well if the horoscope says so... can't fight fate!</Text>
  <Text Key="BD8B94BD">Horoscope?! Do you also believe in mole people?</Text>
  <Text Key="98F47289">Stars are not aligned today. But they might be later.</Text>
  <Text Key="62D79D85">There is this primal, animal-like urge in all of us. Some of us fight it, but I think we should just give ourselves up to it, and act on it.</Text>
  <Text Key="6540E31A">I think I feel it too. You mean sex, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="376F5CBF">You're a moron. Leave me alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="EDCFA433">What are you talking about?!</Text>
  <Text Key="BF687BAF">I want to have fuck with you.</Text>
  <Text Key="43A8B9A8">Hope you've got the endurance. Let's go.</Text>
  <Text Key="36839C1E">What an idiotic suggestion. Get lost.</Text>
  <Text Key="20E32C0E">What was that? That's not even how words are used.</Text>
  <Text Key="21D20433">Would you be willing to have sex with me, you know, for practice?</Text>
  <Text Key="A2CAC0F0">What else are friends for?</Text>
  <Text Key="318C4BB0">Sure, I could use the practice myself.</Text>
  <Text Key="488F340E">I don’t want to complicate our friendship.</Text>
  <Text Key="1C515FC1">I cannot believe you just asked me that! No!</Text>
  <Text Key="0D94BC2F">Sometimes we've got to get by with a little help from our friends.\nThere's nothing I need more help with than this raging sensation in my {M0.pants}{F0.panties}.\nHow about you and I help each other out?</Text>
  <Text Key="C05A1BC1">Sure, I'm always keen to lend a helping hand.</Text>
  <Text Key="C414B031">You're not going to get that kind of help from me. No.</Text>
  <Text Key="7118235D">I don't think I need your help with anything right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="9E99C310">Hey... {1.SimFirstName}. We're good friends. Would you like to become more... intimate with each other?</Text>
  <Text Key="DAFBF66C">I've felt this way about you for some time as well!</Text>
  <Text Key="06EFD2FC">No {0.SimFirstName}, I don't feel that way about you...</Text>
  <Text Key="F14CE752">I'm not sure I understand the question...</Text>
  <Text Key="A132BC68">I like you, and I'd like to see you naked while I'm naked and then we would do some stuff together.</Text>
  <Text Key="1881630D">Ugh... haha, sure... let's do it!</Text>
  <Text Key="1C5E498C">Not interested.</Text>
  <Text Key="C05E60EB">Let's &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; about that some other time.</Text>
  <Text Key="54055A3A">I was thinking... how do you like an idea of us... sleeping together?</Text>
  <Text Key="DAABA1D9">Is this a proposition? Cause I'm all in!</Text>
  <Text Key="E8E553D4">I see it working for some, but not for us.</Text>
  <Text Key="E6E18542">Like in one bed? Weird, why would you want that?</Text>
  <Text Key="5783E106">Wanna play Truth or Dare? I dare you to have sex with me!</Text>
  <Text Key="E999D40B">My dare was gonna be the same!</Text>
  <Text Key="1B93C29A">Uh... sorry, but no.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD29B42B">But... I would have picked Truth...</Text>
  <Text Key="D087546C">I feel there's been a sexual tension building between us. Wanna release it?</Text>
  <Text Key="AF0C6BC4">I felt it too. Let's do it.</Text>
  <Text Key="0B25F8A7">Can't say I feel it, no.</Text>
  <Text Key="A376B13E">Maybe we should let it build for a little longer?</Text>
  <Text Key="1FF1443C">I think you're &lt;i&gt;dense&lt;/i&gt; if you feel that way.</Text>
  <Text Key="000EBFD7">Is it just me or do I feel like you're coming onto me sexually?</Text>
  <Text Key="32C77BE9">I was worrying you're never going to realize that!</Text>
  <Text Key="DFBFC0CE">It's just you. Pig.</Text>
  <Text Key="131FCC6B">I wasn't doing that... Yet, anyway.</Text>
  <Text Key="ECFF65AD">Did you know the studies show that good friends sleep together?</Text>
  <Text Key="D6CC85CA">Huh, really? I guess we should have sex then!</Text>
  <Text Key="5A7D32E6">There are no such studies. You're full of crap.</Text>
  <Text Key="12B86FA7">I don't think our friendship is quite there &lt;i&gt;yet.&lt;/i&gt;</Text>
  <Text Key="BED41805">This may come out as corny, but you're making me horny.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F17A6DC">It may be corny, but it's working. Get over here!</Text>
  <Text Key="64CC4A59">Did you really think it's appropriate to say that?</Text>
  <Text Key="5565C900">It was indeed corny, but I'm not horny.</Text>
  <Text Key="AB84AC79">Smile if you wanna have sex with me.</Text>
  <Text Key="19253FAC">*smile*</Text>
  <Text Key="C6E1727E">*angry face*</Text>
  <Text Key="1FCFD417">*keep a poker face*</Text>
  <Text Key="E61EE726">Wanna play pretend we're shooting a porno?</Text>
  <Text Key="CE3E0AB8">I'm always happy to play a lead role in a movie.</Text>
  <Text Key="6412FCEB">No, you wanna play? Play with yourself, asshole!</Text>
  <Text Key="5306C93F">I'll let you know when the mood strikes me.</Text>
  <Text Key="E294E892">Wanna do couple &lt;i&gt;stuff&lt;/i&gt; together? I mean... sex.</Text>
  <Text Key="B78CF2DD">Let's do it a &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt; of times!</Text>
  <Text Key="7E6823EF">I'd rather not, if you don't mind.</Text>
  <Text Key="F296BCBA">Not right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="AD56026E">{1.SimFirstName}, are you in a mood to... &lt;i&gt;you know&lt;/i&gt;... with me?</Text>
  <Text Key="A32256CA">I know that you know that I am!</Text>
  <Text Key="721957B3">Nah, not really.</Text>
  <Text Key="634B20FE">To what? I don't understand.</Text>
  <Text Key="7DC5A1B1">I had a dirty dream with both of us in leading roles. Wanna &lt;i&gt;come&lt;/i&gt; and make it true?</Text>
  <Text Key="E23A8062">I wonder what the script is, show me!</Text>
  <Text Key="BC12626D">I don't really star in cheap porn.</Text>
  <Text Key="5F11CBB9">My schedule is swamped right now, maybe later.</Text>
  <Text Key="8592C5A9">That's a weird thing to say, honestly...</Text>
  <Text Key="25B48200">Wanna strip naked and make each other feel good with various parts of our bodies?</Text>
  <Text Key="A6EE46DB">Sure you weird freak!</Text>
  <Text Key="58096F2B">No, not when you put it like that.</Text>
  <Text Key="E0E72B96">I wanted to but you just killed the mood. Later?</Text>
  <Text Key="85A3BB0C">I'm kinda turned on right now, what about you?</Text>
  <Text Key="3EE2375A">Ditto.</Text>
  <Text Key="0EF046C3">No, I'm not.</Text>

  <Text Key="3227763B">I'm always down to get dirty with you!</Text>
  <Text Key="A1784D62">That will be a firm 'no'.</Text>
  <Text Key="748D26B9">I'm fine at the moment. Maybe later?</Text>

  <Text Key="FBFFDEA9">Bartender Tip</Text>
  <Text Key="FC8385B0">High Price Markup and Low Bar Supplies decrease the likeliness of clients purchasing drinks.\n\nShortage of supplies means fewer drinks to offer, and increased price makes them less appealing for purchase. When you can't sell the client's favorite drinks, lower the 'Price Markup' to make other drinks an attractive offer.\n\nClick on any Bar to access the Strip Club Price Markup menu.</Text>
  <Text Key="0B16457E">Bar Supplies are required to prepare drinks for clients. Each prepared drink consumes supplies, and when they run out, drinks cannot be prepared anymore.\n\nYou can order supplies by clicking on any Bar to access the Strip Club 'Order Supplies' menu.\nPurchased supplies add up to the total of ordered supplies that will be delivered the next day at either noon or midnight depending when the order is made.\nThe cost of supplies depends on the base price of the drinks ordered by clients.
